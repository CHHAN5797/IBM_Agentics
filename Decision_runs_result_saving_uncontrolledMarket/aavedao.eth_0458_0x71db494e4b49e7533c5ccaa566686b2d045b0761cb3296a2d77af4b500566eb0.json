        "body": "**Title:** Aave Treasury Proposal: Onboard with Centrifuge Prime to invest in RWA\n**Author:** @Khan\n**Date:** Aug 21, 2023\n\n\n\n### **Summary**\n\nThis proposal requests that a portion of the Aave Treasury’s stablecoin holdings be allocated to a low-risk RWA investment through Centrifuge Prime.\n\nThis will allow Aave to earn yield on idle stablecoins, establish long-term RWA infrastructure for the protocol, and allow the Aave DAO to begin building internal familiarity and expertise in this market. The Aave Treasury will primarily benefit from an allocation into uncorrelated and differentiated collateral beyond crypto native assets.\n\nThe main results of this proposal:\n\n1. Aave will onboard to Centrifuge Prime to establish the legal and technical infrastructure for the Aave treasury to invest in RWA\n2. Aave Treasury to allocate to RWA, with an initial investment of 1M USDC into short-duration US treasuries, increasing to a target allocation of up to 20% of stablecoin holdings, and with the option to extend to other yields subject to Aave governance approval.\n\n### **Motivation**\n\nAave has long been a contributor and supporter of RWA initiatives. Since the first announcement of GHO, the Aave community has consistently expressed its interest in expanding into this area. Treasury Management at Aave has historically been focused on strategic crypto assets, overlooking the returns and liquidity available in offchain markets. \n\nToday, with roughly 65% of the treasury in USDC (~15m USD), the Aave DAO is overlooking the 5% available interest in the risk-free rate of overnight financing of US treasury assets. This can offer $250,000 of revenue a year at just 5m USD of investment (a ~30% allocation of the current USDC balance). These markets can immediately become some of the highest earning revenue streams for the DAO.\n\nBeyond just economics, this proposal would allow the Aave DAO to establish and begin developing the internal RWA expertise necessary to engage with these markets. Centrifuge Prime has been purpose built for DAOs, offering the ability to create a dedicated infrastructure, onboard with an ecosystem of partners, and access the relevant portfolio of assets through a single interface.\n\nCentrifuge has a long track record of working with DAOs to bring RWA on as collateral, and pioneered the first Aave deployment into RWA with the joint development of the RWA Market. Onboarding Aave to Centrifuge Prime for liquid investment strategies is an optimal approach for scaling RWA with the Aave community. It will develop the legal and technical infrastructure necessary to interface with RWAs safely and efficiently, while allowing the Aave community to get comfortable and familiar with the processes and thinking around RWA. This will put Aave in a significantly improved position to be able to leverage RWA collateral for GHO in the long term, either to improve liquidity or develop additional revenue streams, while also earning revenue today on idle stablecoin assets.\n\n### **Specification**\n\nThis proposal instructs Centrifuge to initiate the setup of a legal structure that will be ratified and deployed by a subsequent Aave community vote. The legal structure will be integrated with DAO governance, capable of investing and holding assets on behalf of the DAO, and ultimately allow the Aave DAO legal recourse to their investments with control held by governance token holders. This framework is based on our extensive experience in MakerDAO setting up [similar](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mip6-blocktower-credit-transaction-documents/19019) [structures](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/rwa-002-new-silver-restructuring-risk-and-legal-assessment/21417).\n\nThe investment process will be made in an incremental approach with follow-on approval from the community, to be made by Centrifuge once this proposal is approved. Prime allows the Aave DAO to instruct the portfolio creation and allocation decisions. The initial investments will be a short term US treasury bill fund, with further opportunities to diversify yields available later on.\n\nCentrifuge Prime can help the Aave DAO to allocate into the following asset classes:\n\n|Bucket|Description|Target Return|Liquidity|\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|Liquid|Lowest risk while maintaining US Treasuries, MMF, AA+ rated short term bonds|5-6%|Daily|\n|Preservation|Investments in senior secured loans such as real estate, corporate bonds etc.|6-8%|3-6 months|\n|Acceleration|Trade finance, non-bank originators, emerging markets|8-15%|3-24mo|\n\nThe legal structure establishes a Caymans Islands foundation company. The articles that establish this foundation company define rules and procedures that only allow the foundation to receive and follow orders from a DAO governance process. The foundation company does not represent the DAO generally but simply serves as a tool that the DAO can use to engage with the traditional legal system of RWA markets. \n\n### **Rollout**\n\nIt is best for Aave to deploy into RWAs slowly. We propose to start off with an initial deployment into a Short Term US Treasury fund with an initial investment of $1M and then slowly ramping up.\n\n|Phase|||\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|Legal setup|Creation of Foundation Company, passing of DAO resolutions to start deployment into RWAs|1-2 months|\n|Initial Deployment|DAO instructs Foundation to deploy $1M into a US Treasuries Fund and transfers $1M in USDC Stablecoins into a first investment pool|3mo|\n|Scaling up / Ongoing Operation|DAO can vote on increase allocation to Prime and direct investments towards a variety of liquid lower yielding and more longer term investments at any time|After 3mo|\n\n### **Fees**\n\nWhile there are some legal setup costs that have to be covered by the DAO upfront we limit these as much as possible. Even at a conservative deployment of just $2M and a portfolio return equal to current US Treasury yields Aave should break-even within the first 6mo and start generating revenue for the DAO thereafter. The legal work will be useful far beyond this initial proposal and could be the basis on which Aave onboards RWAs into GHO.\n\n|Fees|||\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|Legal Setup|up to 50,000 USDC|To be paid immediately for lawyers and Cayman service providers to setup a Cayman foundation company to the benefit of the Aave DAO, any unused budget will be returned to the Aave treasury|\n|Portfolio Fee|0.35% p.a. on assets in Prime up to $50M, 0.2% $50-100M, 0.1% >$100M|Paid on an ongoing basis to Centrifuge for maintaining the portfolio|\n|Aave Reward|500 stkAave streamed over 2 years|Centrifuge DAO intends for this to create better alignment with strong skin in the game incentives for success.|\n\n### **Additional Resources**\n\n* [Centrifuge Prime Announcement](https://medium.com/centrifuge/introducing-centrifuge-prime-real-yields-real-defi-b97a0e767f18)\n* [A Discussion on a GHO Real World Asset Facilitator](https://governance.aave.com/t/a-discussion-on-a-gho-real-world-asset-facilitator/11908/5)\n* [Centrifuge website](https://centrifuge.io) and [docs](https://docs.centrifuge.io/)\n\n### **Disclaimer**: \nThis proposal is written by a member of the k/factory team, a core contributor to the Centrifuge protocol.\n\n### **Next Steps**: \nThis proposal will move to an offchain snapshot vote in 7-14 days, and if successful, to an onchain AIP immediately after.

TokenLogic shall focus on Aave DAO finances and support GHO adoption.\n\n\n# Introduction\n\nMembers of the TokenLogic team have been contributing to Aave Protocol since mid 2020. More recently, the team has been expanding in preparation to better support our three focus areas:\n\n* Treasury Management\n* Safety Module modelling\n* GHO Adoption\n\nTokenLogic is a developer focused team with a proven track recorded dating back to March 2023 when the delegation platform was annouced. During this time we have delivered the following:\n\n* 5 AIPs, 6 payloads, several GHO related BIPs\n* [GHO liquidity pools analysis](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-gho-liquidity-pools-primary-pools-initial-strategy/14071)\n* Coordinated [7.7%](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-gho-liquidity-pools-primary-pools-initial-strategy/14071) veBAL support for GHO's launch\n* Stoodup an analytics platform \n* Launch of [GHO Analytics frontend](https://governance.aave.com/t/tokenlogic-delegate-platform/12516)\n\nThe team is growing and we onboarded an accounting team to start developing a Aave Financial Reporting (genesis to date) frontend, launch date mid/late Q4 2023.\n\n# Current & Future Areas of Focus\n\n The below provides a high level overview of our **key focus** areas:\n\n* **Treasury Management**\n    * Improving the risk adjusted return of DAO's assets\n        * Aave v2 to v3 migrations\n        * Swap long tail assets to ETH / stable coins\n    * Improving capital efficiency\n        * Convert wMATIC to MaticX & stMATIC\n    * Managing strategic assets\n        * Upgrades to Strategic Asset Manager v1 functionality as required\n    * Modelling asset purchase / bribe\n        * Participate in Quest/Bribe v acquiring asset\n    * Engage, collaborate and support community lead initiatives\n        * Example: How best to optimise CRV holding\n    * Oversee Protocol Owned Liquidity (POL) deployment\n        * If DAO elects to provide POL, ensure Boost is directed to holding to optimise returns and maintain the strategy through claiming and swapping/locking rewards.\n    * Design and create a contract for managing DAO's POL\n        * Perform swaps, claim incentives, transfer assets etc...\n    * Claim Aave Protocol revenue fees at the end of each month\n        * This bot is currently operated by Llama\n\n* **GHO Liquidity / Incentives Management**\n    * Create Liquidity Management Committee / Budget\n        * Provide modelling to support Committee decision making\n    * Liquidity Incentive Optimisation Analysis (Strategic Assets)\n        * Target pool sizes & APRs \n    * Explore synergies with Safety Module diversification\n        * Potential to include GHO liquidity pools\n        * We will lead this effort after Llama's contract finishes\n* **Financial Reporting**\n    * Runway forecast\n        * Specifically tracking asset balance and drawdown rates to show when other assets require being swapped to fund the DAO\n    * Budget and resource allocation\n        * Work with ACI and others to develop a DAO budget\n    * Transparent accurate, third party reviewed, accessible financial statments\n        * Launch a financial statment frontend mid/late Q4 2023\n        * Cover Ethereum, Polygon (PoS), Arbitrum, Optimism and Avalanche initially and expand over time.\n        * Quarterly financial publications \n    * Revenue per Reserve v time charts\n        * Daily or Hourly data showing revenue being generated per Reserve on each Aave v2 and v3 iteration\n        * Users will be able to select an asset and see total revenue noiminated in the underlying or select an instance of Aave and a specific asset.\n        * Data will be displayed graphically with some ability to interact with the charts\n* **Supporting GHO Adoption**\n    * Collaborate with other teams to support GHO adoption\n        * Promote utility and velocity\n    * Continual development of GHO Analytics frontend\n    * Promote adoption through DeFi integrations\n        * Examples include working with teams to build real yield strategies, structured products and list GHO as collateral\n* **Safety Module Improvements**\n    * Model the SM performance during shortfall events\n        * Create a frontend that show historical performance for swapping certain amounts of each asset instantly (not dutch auction) via an aggregator\n    * Model / forecast emission budget\n        * AAVE emissions are finite, GHO is better\n        * Capital efficiency could be improved through adoption of quests and/or acquiring assets that control the emission schedule of another protocol\n    * Advocate for diversification and reducing the reward budget\n        * Introduction of stable coins, ETH and other assets to reduce reliance on AAVE during shortfall events\n    * Collaborate with others to refine to enhance the SM's effectiveness at providing a backstop for Aave Protocol\n        * BGD to implement on-chain upgrades\n        * Model liquidity pool assets to be added to SM\n        * Work with ACI, BGD, Llama and others to determine a target coverage, implementation of proposals and refine the asset blend\n\nEach of the areas detailed above is interwoven and has a material affect on the DAO's financial status. TokenLogic is committed to working with other DAO contributors collaboratively and constructively to better the Aave Protocol. \n\nTo support the initiatives aboves, we have created an analytics platform. The GHO dashboard is our first analytics initiative. Beyond GHO, we plan on using the analytics platform to provide the DAO with near live revenue data stream for each asset reserve on supported networks. We seek to always incorporate community feedback and build out any requests from the community.\n\nOur team is very well connected across defi and we intend to support Aave and GHO where ever we can. To this end, we are already working with several teams looking to integrate GHO and have been working with @0xbilll at AGD with targeted spending initiatives.\n\nTo ensure continuation of active work scopes, TokenLogic will continue to manage the migration of users on Polygon v2 to v3. This includes either fortnightly or monthly parameter adjustments. We encourage another service provider to pick up the Avalanche v2 migration.

Those same LP positions can be deposited into other protocols to earn yield without the prospect of being slashed. These alternative investment options create an opportunity cost and act as a minimum APY hurdle rate when considering investing in Aave’s SM.\n\nThis publication presents an opportunity to enable participants in the Aave SM to earn rewards from other protocols whilst providing a backstop to Aave. The inclusion of GHO pools further helps provide sustained liquidity in the market and generate revenue for Aave through GHO’s borrow rate.\n\nThis introduces the prospect of increasing the sustainability of the SM by enabling rewards to scale with TVL over time which is currently solely dependent upon AAVE’s price correlation with the SM’s TVL given the fixed distribution limitation.\n\nThis proposal will discuss the differences between “classic” gauges and specific ones (“smBPT gauges”) as outlined in the [intro post](https://governance.aave.com/t/discussion-safety-module/12029/6?u=dydymoon), and will introduce the strategy.\n\n# Motivation\n\nThe Balancer Liquidity Mining system is an automated program which governs the minting of all BAL tokens based on on-chain voting by veBAL holders. veBAL is obtained by joining the canonical 80/20 BAL/ETH Weighted Pool and then locking the Pool shares token (often called BPT, for ‘Balancer Pool Token’) for a time duration up to 1 year. The longer the 80/20 BPT is locked for, the more veBAL and voting power is obtained.\n\nBalancer token emission is currently at 121,930 BAL/week and decreases linearly each year.\n\nveBAL holders can vote each week to redirect part of these incentives to the pool of their choice.\n\nAt the time of writing, 1 veBAL can redirect 0.01187 BAL /veBAL vote/week ($0.0851).\n\nBy using the voting power & voting incentives, it is possible to either leverage better rewards for the similar $$ cost or similar APR rewards with reduced cost. Our calculations are based on delivering a similar APR to users whilst reducing the overall dollar spend on the SM.\n\nLike Curve, the APR of liquidity pools staked on Balancer (BPT-XX-gauge) can be boosted up 2.5x depending on several parameters, such as veBAL boost holdings, value deposited, total TVL of the pool etc. However, having the max boost requires a huge amount of veBAL, which most projects don’t have.\n\nWhile they can still buy boosts on Marketplace like Warden, it can be expensive and potentially limitate the strategy profitability. However, there are projects accumulating a considerable amount of veTokens to mutualize the boost, improving the yield for depositors.\n\nAura Finance is the biggest on the Balancer ecosystem with [27% of the veBAL held by the protocol](https://www.defiwars.xyz/wars/balancer). These holdings are utilized to boost the users deposits (Most of the pools are currently boosted ~1.4x).\n\nIt’s important to note that 25% of all BAL earned on Aura are captured by the protocol, which distributes AURA rewards in return, the Aura Finance governance token. More details on the AURA distribution can be found [here](https://docs.aura.finance/aura/usdaura/distribution).\n\nThe AURA token can be locked for 4 months for vlAURA without decay on the voting power, which allows to participate on Aura Governance, Balancer gauges votes as it controls the underlying veBAL voting power, and can receive rewards in auraBAL & vote incentives. At this time, 1 vlAURA controls 0.2081 veBAL. Once a gauge is voted on Balancer, the pool is added on Aura Finance in the following days.\n\nThe goal of this proposal is to consider staking the LPs deposited in the SM on Aura Finance, to receive BAL + AURA rewards distributed to SM depositors. However, there are different possibilities to reach this goal:\n\n## “Classic” gauges mechanism\n\nAfter a liquidity pool is created, an application is shared on the respective communities governance forum to create a gauge. Upon creation, users are able to deposit their LPs into the gauges to earn rewards.\n\nProjects like Aura Finance receive the BPTs, deposit them into the Balancer gauge and retain a portion of the BAL emission in exchange of their own governance token. Users receive an elevated yield to reward users for the additional smart contract risk and premium for replacing BAL with AURA. Aave could deploy contracts within the SM that extends this concept and enable users to receive Aura Finance and Balancer rewards.\n\nMost projects are proposing to enable the gauge on the BPT assets. This works quite well because they are creating vote incentives (often with their native token) to acquire votes in veBAL & wrappers, directing more rewards to the pool, making it attractive for the community to deposit liquidity.\n\nHowever, if Aave’s SM was to accept the BPT directly and not deposit the BPT into the Balancer Gauge. Any users could deposit & stake their BPT to receive BPT-gauge without depositing in the SM, allowing them to bypass the SM lock period and cooldown to receive the same incentives as SM depositors, so classic gauges invalidates the strategy\n\nThis would create a huge dilution for Aave, which is a large issue when the liquidity also doubles as protocol insurance. If Aave was to offer the same APR as Aura Finance there is no incentive for users to take on the additional shortfall and cool down period lock up risk/opportunity cost.\n\nIn Part IV, the SM upgrade proposal will consider using 75% of the current incentives budget for volatile & stable BPTs categories. That’s 825 AAVE/ day that could either be used to incentivize the pools directly (Not recommended to keep doing liquidity mining for all categories) or to create vote incentives for the associated gauges driving a higher rewards value to the pools.\n\nThis method can still be used for main liquidity pools outside of the SM, but to keep the proposed strategy profitable for Aave, an alternative could be what this publication will refer to as “smBPT gauges” which is a suggestion from Solarcurve.\n\n## “smBPT gauges mechanism”\n\nThe method requires implementing a wrapper in the safety module. The SM contract receives BPT from users, and deposits in the wrapper contract which would mint smBPT received by the SM.\n\nInstead of enabling gauges that accept the BPT, Balancer can approve BAL emissions to gauges which accept the smBPT. Users would have the option to deposit the BPT into Aave’s SM to mint smBPT which will be deposited on Aura Finance which then deposits the smBPT into the Balancer gauge.\n\nThis means that any users could deposit liquidity and receive the trading fees on the underlying Balancer pools, but only users who stake their BPT in the SM would be eligible to gauge rewards.\n\nIf the smBPT gauges are approved by the Balancer DAO, Aura Finance will implement the pools associated with these gauges. The gauges will only accept smBPT. This eliminates the opportunity cost as users can not deposit into Aura Finance or Balancer’s gauge directly and avoid the slashing plus cool down risk. Considering that the SM would mint the smBPT internally, it would be the only contract available to stake on this gauge.\n\nOnce deposited, the SM contract would receive “aurasmBPT-gauge” and mint “StkaurasmBPT-gauge” distributed to the initial BPT depositors.\n\nIf a user wants to withdraw from the SM, he would activate the cooldown period. The SM contract would then burn the “aurasmBPT-gauge” by unstaking from Aura Finance to receive smBPT. It would then unlock and distribute the BPT as well as burn the smBPT and “StkaurasmBPT-gauge” once the withdrawal is done.\n\nAt this point, and while several aspects of the proposals have been updated since the strategy introduction post, this chart should help understand and visualize the overall strategy described.\n\n ![image](ipfs://bafkreih2bqouhr75txq5jog2gi4xdstlorn7wb3qdhjkzhlmhem6ojn7ey)\n    \nConsidering that the veBAL voting power held by Aave is not enough to sustain these pools with good TVL, the goal is to use part of the SM rewards budget as votes incentives.\n\nThe part IV of this proposal will focus on incentives management updates and details on estimations made, while the part V will be mostly about further considerations.\n\n## smBPT Risks\n\nTo implement interoperability and integrate different protocols, several changes are needed, which will result in the upgraded SM contracts having greater smart contract risk than in the current implementation. Introducing smBPT to the SM creates additional Balancer gauge and Aura smart contract risk exposure.\n\nThe current ABPT integration demonstrates the community's willingness to have exposure to the Balancer protocol within the SM. Aave further demonstrated confidence in the Balancer <> Aave partnership via the token swap performed during 2022. Since then, Balancer has launched several liquidity pools which deposit funds in Aave v3 across several networks. Further, BGD has already proposed upgrading to Balancer V2 and Aave Companies have recently [proposed including BPT assets as collateral.](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-staked-atokens-a-new-aave-primitive-exploring-vote-escrow-economies/10406)\n\nAave and Balancer have been working together since the launch of the Safety Module. Further, BGD has already proposed upgrading to Balancer V2 and Aave Companies have recently [proposed including BPT assets as collateral.](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-staked-atokens-a-new-aave-primitive-exploring-vote-escrow-economies/10406)\n\nAura Finance is a protocol built on top of the[ Balancer system](https://app.balancer.fi/#/) to provide maximum incentives to Balancer liquidity providers and BAL stakers (into[ veBAL](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/introducing-vebal-tokenomics/2512)) through social aggregation of BAL deposits and Aura’s native token. Even if the protocol is relatively young (launched on June 3, 2022), the team has an extensive focus on security, having run 3 [audits](https://docs.aura.finance/aura/security#audits): [Peckshield](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1S5jnMddjbVUsAdVZtmcIRlL4WhVueSzp/view), [Halborn,](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vsZ9aAVJ8mobLaJ5-XDejcHdRFK1StjM/view) [Code4rena](https://github.com/aurafinance/aura-contracts/blob/main/audits/Code4rena-Audit-Report-AuraFinance-v1.0.pdf)\n\nAura started a $1 million [bug bounty program on Immunefi](https://immunefi.com/bounty/aurafinance/) on June 16, 2022 and to date, no vulnerabilities have been found.\n\nMoreover, Aura was given a rating of [88% from DeFiSafety](https://defisafety.com/app/pqrs/526) which also suggested improvements to protocol documentation (actively being worked on now by contributors).\n\nFinally, some security researchers and developers are closely looped into Aura via its multisig, and general protocol oversight.\n\n## Smart Contract Considerations\n\nAave Governance as admin, can perform the following:\n\n* Add/remove assets into the SM\n* Invoke Emergency power to withdraw of all funds deployed by the SM on Aura\n* Update reward budget influencing the SM yield\n* Update the slashing parameters & associated yield ranges\n\nAave SM as admin, can perform the following:\n\n* Receive BPT and mint smBPT\n* Deposit/withdraw smBPT from Aura\n* Mint/Burn smBPT and aurasmBPT-XX-gauge\n* Claim BAL & AURA rewards\n* Redistribute the rewards to StkaurasmBPT-XX-gauge or StkTokens holders (This can probably done weekly/bi-weekly)\n\n# Technical Specifications\n\n* Deploy wrapper contract to wrap BPT into smBPT (BGD)\n* Enable gauges on smBPT voted in Part I & II.

These rewards allow Aave to attract deposits, where up to 30% can be used to insure the protocol in case of shortfall event. At the moment, 100% of these incentives are spent in liquidity mining from the Ecosystem Reserve, which represents $89.3K daily or $32.6M yearly expense for the DAO.\n\nThis publication presents the community with an opportunity to reshape how AAVE incentives are distributed to significantly improve Aave’s economics and enhance the capital efficiency of the SM.\n\n* Increased Backstop Value\n* Decreased AAVE Spend\n* Increased Yield for depositors\n* Improved Profitability and Financial Sustainability\n\nThis publication focuses on how incentives are distributed to reduce the overall AAVE spend without exceeding the current AAVE budget & shares the estimated results from the strategy.\n\n# Rationale\n\nA quick recap of proposed from the current design so far:\n\n* Part I - SstkABPT update proposal (Part I)\n  * Support of the migration to a new BPT B-80-AAVE-20wstETH\n\n* Part II - Categories implementation (Part II)\n  * Single assets, volatile BPTs and stable BPTs.\n\n* Part II- Slashing update (Part II)\n  * Each category will have a different max slashing parameter\n\n* Part III -BPT positions staked on the SM - smBPTs (Part III)\n  * Create gauges for smBPTon staked assets and enable users to receive to avoid incentives dilution, Introduce smBPT wrapper, and explain Aura Finance strategy to receive BAL & AURA rewards.\n\nThis publication presents a revised outlook on how the majority of the current AAVE budget could be distributed as vote incentives for smBPT gauges. Additionally, the DAO could decide to optimize its strategic voting power to reduce the SM costs.\n\nDo note the APR generated from depositing into the SM has dependencies such as the BAL, AURA and AAVE token prices. If this proposal is approved, several solutions can be explored to reduce this risk. If it becomes unprofitable over time because of BAL or AURA prices, a fallback option can be added to switch back to the current LM design if needed until finding a better optimization.\n\nThe design is flexible enough to accommodate various market conditions and for Aave to pivot from AAVE to GHO rewards over time. This represents a shift on the base incentives from Aave governance token distribution to yield derived from cash flow sustained by the business.This will allow to improve the fallback option to always optimize the best yield between direct profit sharing distributed or used to leverage more yield through votes incentives.\n\n## veBAL Voting Power\n\nLlama recently published a proposal to deploy the BAL holdings. This proposal will help provide a better understanding of why Llama recommended the community to vote for acquiring veBAL.\n\nOverview of the veBAL position if locked today:\n\n![|566x186](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/2xlP4WbgttqDygSf06fk1AyRlqdq8JgW_xVGyPyZnkcNpN9EEGFfY_H_VMcVozZY9mrdzrQrp37PxbXQkSUxTjHYvsavlxyvvFFGqoHp80eLqjc7owdYdFugJ40Tp7xs2nbYZoKnNRk7dWkO9wzx5CA)\n\nETH needed and the LP tokens amount received are verified with https://balancer.tools/veBAL.\n\n![|414x79](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/LECeCOxUTEB4UlvHAyEaCa3FEImGhUYGdDxKUCULK_eqW7dU9V4MaEF70AH6pJFHOMSjM-KaCjcJ-T_l8qG_sSu-L611Ctjk6JejFn6pDxWe1r13IIa9dsVQ2mYsgykdgYqIyFO2LqE73491CcNtjE0)\n\nThe table above shows how much weekly BAL emission is controlled, assuming the DAO uses only its owned veBAL voting power (i.e. without creating vote incentives).These calculations are based on the BAL emission in April 2023: 121,930 BAL/week instead of 145,000 until March 2023.\n\nAave DAO voting power is a good start and can be utilized to support, not limited to, the below strategies:\n\n* Help sustain the Safety Module yield\n* Grow and sustain the GHO liquidity\n* Boost the Staked aTokens gauges\n* Redirect incentives on existing Balancer pools\n* Optimize the yield on treasury strategies\n\nHowever, due to the limited veBAL holding size relative to Aave’s aspirations, the community will need to choose between the choices above. Several other possibilities to increase the strategic voting power accumulation in addition to the reserve factors earnings are presented below:\n\n* [Deploy treasury strategies to farm BAL/AURA with stables & ETH](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-deploy-ethereum-collector-contract/12205)\n\n* [Acquire more BAL/start acquire AURA with the treasury to lock it ](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-strategic-partnership-with-balancer-part-2/7813)\n* Potential Grants from Aura & Balancer\n\n## Safety Module Cover Overview\n\nAssuming that 100% of the Aave TVL was covered by the SM, the DAO would pay 30,02% on its insurance.\n\n![|602x59](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/_4IccaU07Rbv86PhERhDx1iYKoJDNE01HRG31zy3tSaqw0OAn_RY8AufyPgdDFLddVifzmD4xQmow_tzDYmH7yzg7gTbRUEu94dP_AgnVEl5sbwx5GviMWSSMue0ulB1eFAn5HTE0QgBNF4rBqGWgSI)\n\n(1.43% of the TVL is currently covered and the DAO which pays 30,02% APR on these funds). The new strategy aims to increase the Safety Module coverage above 2.00% while also reducing insurance costs by at least 30%.\n\n## Incentives Distribution Upgrade\n\nNote that all TVLs below have been added to estimate the max capacity of the SM with the current budget by maintaining the APR in range.\n\n### Single Assets\n\nThis publication features continuing the rewards with 25% of the current budget for single assets. At a later date, the community can explore progressively replacing AAVE with GHO rewards.\n\n* AAVE: TVL Estimation used for the upcoming calculations:\n\n60% of the current stkAAVE TVL\n\nWe estimate a reduction of the TVL due to the APR lowered by the budget reallocation\n\n(200 AAVE/day until GHO is live vs 550 AAVE/day at the moment.) .\n\n* ETH / stETH: TVL Estimation used for the upcoming calculations:\n\n75k ETH / stETH\n\n(Llama proposes to allocate a budget of 75 AAVE/day to reward ETH and/or stETH deposits until GHO is live)\n\nThis means reducing the liquidity mining by focusing it on single assets only, since it’s not possible to add gauges for it. The remaining AAVE currently being spent in LM to incentivize both veBAL & vlAURA voters on Warden Quest, which allows to redirect rewards on smBPTs gauges, in a better proportion than LM.\n\n## What is Warden Quest?\n\nWarden Quest by Paladin, offers a new approach to Gauge Weight vote acquisition for Curve & Balancer. Instead of offering an arbitrary amount of rewards to influence voters, Quest allows players to set parameters & rewards for each weekly vote period.\n\nAfter the rewards distribution to voters, if the total budget wasn't spent (i.e.,if the objective wasn't reached), Quest creators can redeem the unspent budget minus the fees.\n\nAdditionally, Quest now offers the possibility for vlAURA holders to claim rewards from veBAL quests, allowing Aave DAO to create vote incentives for both at once.\n\nFinally, with the estimated budget of this post, Quest fees would be at 2,8% instead of 4%.\n\nNote: This proposal doesn’t plan to create vote incentives on the StakedATokens gauges, but the DAO could vote to do it later. In such a case, the Quest weekly volume would lead to the lowest fee possible: 2%. More information on Warden Quest can be found [here](https://doc.paladin.vote/warden-quest/introduction).\n\n## Volatile & Stable BPTs\n\nThe SM Upgrade strategy aims to maintain the volatile BPTs APR in the 8 to 12% range, and the stable BPTs APR in the 18 to 22% range. The BAL & AURA rewards could be distributed weekly to SM depositors.\n\n* B-80AAVE-20wstETH: Max TVL estimation used: $100M\n\n* B-80GHO-20wETH: Max TVL estimation used: $50M$\n\n* B-GHO-3Pool: Max TVL estimation used: $100M\n\n![|602x132](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/SpKMcUQtiB4wEV4_28TEmzln1kV-XvgxaMWl8b7Gskws4NyE3R4_s4sGxGCBSzI8EDv254g8Jep_kTdi74E4OEEzYijcNq56-6Kxp-0KGO2_NrquOGi0ll3R-RtSEB9XO2oAqzoR9sFhHQWkGr6Gpfw)\n\nThese estimations demonstrate the possibility of reaching the APR targets outlined above.\n\nThe vlAURA votes amount needed is defined by a target in veBAL votes, which is why the total exceeds 100% of the vlAURA supply.The veBAL votes target can be reached by creating vote incentives for veBAL, vlAURA, veTETU and sdBAL, all supported on Quest.\n\nNote: veTETU vote incentives would require more management as veTETU on Polygon, so we’ve excluded it from this proposal for now. sdBAL vote incentives are also excluded because of the small veBAL holdings.\n\n![|602x152](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/64YqdC6KmmZAUULAUOg71tPIv1c0B1bLlomXQ6jJVgcwf18mWUMAcZhdcBvdLhi7NjPLJYoTftfl2YPxsZ179v8u_ogbq0Es3U61gptCID7YD1QnxsNL61f3bfMhaRz4N1669rUJTy9jGyy4SyjN4R0)\n\n(Yellow cells are manually added & Orange cells are max estimated TVL. The remaining data are calculated or imported from Etherscan and CoinGecko data in real time, so numbers are changing very often depending on all the variables).\n\n## smBPTs Quests Results Overview\n\n![|602x83](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/xmMXkpyZUu4J7HJC9r_b0lZyKGiWp-_LXkst-HVh9QRFTuHuMXCiWC0aNI_aOdckGrvTfu1Zt6Q9uLKFDRfqaFT9vZUOLIbsDe04lrjVEppw9sb8li1bbpVKsTkZZc3ACHIhUQkcQzx_6z1mEokw7bM)\n\nThe cost per vlAURA/round is from [Llama Airforce](https://llama.airforce/#/bribes/rounds/hh/aura-bal/8).\n\nThe vlAURA votes are priced 2% above the last round's prices, as this market does fluctuate a lot (1 round = 2 weeks). Aave would need to control ~30,08% of the veBAL voting supply on the SM gauges to reach the target APRs shown above.\n\nThe table above demonstrates that Aura is way more interesting than Balancer without max boost. Creating the same vote incentives but farming on Balancer would not be profitable.\n\nIn this strategy, the SM depositors would earn $194,000/round ($97,000/week) in extra BAL & AURA rewards directed with votes incentives compared to AAVE tokens liquidity mining distribution.\n\nWhile the TVL max estimations are high in this proposal, this helped define the max capacity of this strategy with the current budget, evaluate the yield possibilities, and learnt the communities sentiment. However, the goal is to progressively increase the TVL target & associated votes incentives budget.\n\nThe requested amount of votes and rewards requires an active management to optimize the Quests, which is why this publication leans away from using Snapshot to determine Aave’s veBAL gauges votes and instead recommends considering different options to optimize the votes, which will be presented in the voting framework proposed in the coming days.\n\nIf the Quests are not filled, the unspent rewards can be redeemed by the DAO (minus the fees) and used for the next round. In this case, a fallback budget should be planned to temporarly compensate part of the yield in liquidity mining initially, then in GHO over time. .\n\nTo avoid this to happen, the strategy considers paying slightly more per vote than the market based on previous round price, to align the economic interest of the protocol and the voters to make sure the votes target are reached. OTC deals could also be discussed with important voters in this ecosystem.\n\n![|706x118](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/zTMjQiAa0TUwZ5MiVQPW9OROSRkoRj1XhD6LuEFdL0hK_TGp713OdJOv1R7a9SZuuWJP3Dm9wlXoPSf878NSzbr9Q9E74Yd3iwpRfNwwNc-uQjPLTwlVTK85No_OmJ3wdVjiROx1ocIh1pCauoAGGE4)\n\nThe AAVE amount spent in vote incentives in the table below is changing very often as defined by several parameters, such as the amount of votes required, the price for veBAL & vlAURA votes, the AAVE token price, the TVL in the smBPT gauges, and later on, governance updates on the SM design proposed if the budget is changed.\n\nWith the above estimations, there is a reduction of the daily LM budget, which can be accumulated as a fallback budget to avoid the unfavorable situation explained above.\n\n![|368x81](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/7RQIzjSHyb9w7XIsffWS78g0smGilUe8Dco3vuymbmWPRBTak9Darub-3m7FLuDTULG17gYabPNiAoq3DDScnWkttSAJJzx7-s28LQBjBEtlSJYRWpqm0kIwyLBtwF5BUsmmfoqQuwcyTEt4PuMpH-I)\n\nAs expected, the cover cost (insurance APR) is also reduced by half, which validates the last goal of this proposal.\n\n![|515x271](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/tR9EqP3W5s0SMSNuM5QnBfwq_dSnrZm3OAlylx5AAG7ExYpDgSNDLizhWMpukSfKhEEWtUw9yBxr-_xHvcBSeFkPpaLKDoFgl_7LYBO0t2Wh7TpMxxxzbN8rRhAPPE7ec-Vzh5HalS1-xsdsEZ3Lkag)\n\nThe last table in Part IV and the 2 above demonstrate that with current market metrics & estimated TVL, the APRs reached on Aura are in the range expected, as well as the average insurance cost reduction from 30,02% to 17,23% and the cover increase from $119M to $175M.\n\nAlso, considering that this strategy will help with both growing the SM (TVL & Cover) and improving the liquidity for Aave tokens, other incentive budgets for GHO liquidity or liquidity mining on StakedATokens could be used for the same strategy.\n\nActions related to the strategic voting power and votes incentives management will be defined by the framework proposal defined in part V, such as:\n\n* Lock veToken assets into Balancer and Aura to generate increased rewards.\n* Create votes incentives on Quest\n* Update the boost power, delegate or sell it on Warden if unused.\n* Vote on gauges & proposals decisions\n* Claim protocol fees\n\n# Technical Implementations:\n\n* Enable weekly distribution for Stable & Volatile BPT rewards\n* Whitelist the AAVE token on Quest as reward (No extra proposal needed)\n* Define the Aave voting framework (Part V)\n\n# Voting options:\n\nYAE - Update the incentives management strategy\nNAE - Continue classic liquidity mining\nABSTAIN\n\n# Disclaimer\n\nThe Llama is not compensated by any of the mentioned communities outside of Aave.\n\nLlama is an unpaid delegate within the Balancer ecosystem.

        "title": "[TEMP CHECK] Aave Chan Initiative 6-Month Budget Proposal",
        "author": "0x329c54289Ff5D6B7b7daE13592C6B1EDA1543eD4",
        "body": "## **Introduction**\n\nThe Aave Chan Initiative (ACI) is a delegate platform dedicated to actively participating in Aave governance and contributing to the protocol's success. As the Aave ecosystem matures, it is essential to have diverse and independent delegate platforms to drive the protocol forward.\n\nTo continue our efforts and effectively serve the Aave community, we are seeking a 6-month budget allocation. This budget will support our ongoing initiatives and enable us to expand our team and resources for maximum impact.\n\n## **ACI's current & future areas of focus**\n\n1. **Governance and AIP Development**\n    - Active participation in Aave governance discussions & votes\n    - Developing and submitting snapshot votes & AIPs\n    - Engaging with the community on forum discussions\n    - Collaborating with other delegates and stakeholders\n2. **Treasury Efficiency and Management**\n    - Collaborate with DAO service contributors, such as Llama, to enhance Aave DAO treasury management.\n    - Support initiatives and actively participate in efforts to improve treasury efficiency, led by Llama and other contributors.\n    - Drive the adoption of strategic investments, diversification, and risk mitigation in treasury allocation.\n    - Establish a cost-conscious culture and ensure responsible spending from the treasury for the benefit of the Aave protocol and its users.\n3. **Protocol and Ecosystem Development**\n    - Support the onboarding of new stablecoins, strategic assets, and LSDs\n    - Explore synergies with other DeFi platforms (e.g., Curve, Balancer, Arrakis)\n    - Promote the use of yield-bearing assets and LP tokens as collateral\n    - Participate in discussions around GHO and Safety Module improvements and advocate for “Real Yield” revenue for the Safety module paid in GHO\n    - Support the expansion of Aave markets in “new Frontiers” networks\n4. **Research and Analysis**\n    - Conduct in-depth research on DeFi trends and developments\n    - Provide insights and recommendations to the Aave community\n    - Analyze the performance and impact of Aave governance decisions\n    - Assess new risk mitigation strategies and techniques\n5. **Team Expansion and Operations**\n    - Grow the ACI team to support the Aave ecosystem better\n    - Cover operational expenses, including tools, subscriptions, and infrastructure\n    - Foster a collaborative environment for continuous learning and improvement\n    - Start a “Meta-Governance” focus for ACI. While the ACI can be considered “Aave-Maximalist,” there’s a lot of potential for having an active presence in other DeFi DAOs and representing Aave-DAO interest there, compared to other “professional” delegates, the laser-focus of ACI on Aave DAO interest will allow to have a voice focused on Aave synergies with other actors of the ecosystem.\n6. **Independence & Transparency**\n    - While the ACI grew to become the largest Aave DAO delegate platform, we are proud that our voting power originates from hundreds of individuals from the community that decided to trust the ACI with their voting and proposal power.\n   - To the best of our knowledge, the ACI voting & proposal power is not linked to any specific entity, Investment firm, or third-party protocol, allowing the ACI to remain 100% independent & focus on the benefit of the Aave protocol.\n   - The ACI firmly declined any form of third-party compensation for creating proposals & publishing AIPs as it would be against our independence ethos. The ACI works for the Aave DAO solely & uniquely.\n   - The ACI created & self-imposed mandatory disclosure on every proposal and will continue to support a transparency culture within the Aave DAO.\n\n## **Previous Work**\n\nHere are some notable achievements and contributions made by the Aave Chan Initiative:\n\n- **Governance Coordination**: The ACI actively supported governance participation & coordination; since the Launch of the ACI, exactly **ZERO** AIPs have failed to meet a 320k AAVE vote participation, while it was unfortunately common in 2022.\n- **AIPs**: The ACI presented and created numerous AIPs that have successfully been implemented to improve the Aave protocol. Since the Launch of the ACI, The AAVE DAO is now the most Active major DeFI DAO in the ecosystem. Q1 2023 was the most active quarter in terms of governance ever for Aave.\n    \n- **Governance improvement**: The ACI is actively involved in improving governance efficiency by providing the community with new frameworks, templates, fast-tracks & shortcuts to make Aave as efficient as possible.\n- **Delegators & contributor coordination:** The ACI actively worked with and supported other DAO delegates, contributors, community members & third-party actors by providing feedback on their proposals, technical support when needed, and doing numerous “co-authorship” synergies with other DAO actors.\n\n## **Requested Budget**\n\nWe are requesting a total budget of $250,000 for 6 months period to support our initiatives, team expansion, and operations. This budget will help us:\n\n- Sustainably continue our current work\n- Cover operational expenses, including tools, subscriptions, and infrastructure required to support our work\n- Grow the ACI team, allowing us to better serve the Aave community and expand our areas of focus. While the “One-Man Army” meme is fun, the current workload and ambitions for the future are not compatible with a single-person operation\n- Establish an active presence in other DeFi DAOs, representing Aave-DAO interests and exploring synergies with other actors in the ecosystem\n\nBy securing this budget, the Aave Chan Initiative will be in a sustainable position to continue to provide value to the Aave ecosystem.\n\n## **Next Steps**\n\nIf the TEMP CHECK is successful and the community supports our proposal, we will move forward with a formal ARFC submission detailing the proposal's specifics such as technical implementation of the proposal.\nWe commit to maintaining transparency throughout the process and regularly updating the community on our progress.\n\nThank you for considering our proposal. We appreciate your support and look forward to working together to drive the success of the Aave protocol.",
