    "summary": "The proposal seeks up to 14 million ARB tokens to incentivize GMX V2 growth and ecosystem integrations, aiming to onboard new users, promote liquidity, and foster builder engagement on Arbitrum. The timeline voting metrics show unanimous early support for 'For'. The community forum sentiment is largely positive with many acknowledging GMX's foundational role in Arbitrum's DeFi ecosystem. Historical proposals with similar intent supported ecosystem growth but led to market declines; lessons highlight the need for prudent grant sizing and effective incentive management. Market impact is slightly negative post-vote but should not drive the decision. Balancing strong community support with ecosystem health, the recommendation is to approve the proposal with a stance to change.",

      "The grant will incentivize liquidity providers and traders, enabling GMX V2 to compete effectively with centralized exchanges and grow the ecosystem.",
