The timeline voting data shows overwhelming early support for the 'For' option, with 98.5% lead ratio and stable voting patterns. Forum sentiment is predominantly positive with 7 positive and 10 neutral comments, highlighting trust in the Premia team and the importance of supporting options trading growth on Arbitrum. A similar past proposal to integrate Rarible on Arbitrum also passed with strong support but experienced post-vote token price and TVL declines, serving as a cautionary lesson. Overall, the proposal aims to increase TVL, user adoption, and community education, aligning well with ecosystem growth objectives.",
