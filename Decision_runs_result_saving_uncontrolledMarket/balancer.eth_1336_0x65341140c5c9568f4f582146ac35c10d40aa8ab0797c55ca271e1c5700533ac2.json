By enabling this gauge, we anticipate enhancing the yield-generating opportunities for both the Balancer community and Origin Ether users. Origin has already brought over 8,443 rETH and ETH to the Balancer ecosystem and this gauge will encourage Origin to bring more.\n\n**References/Useful links:**\n\n\n\n• Website: https://oeth.com\n• Documentation: https://docs.oeth.com\n• Github: [https://github.com/originprotocol](https://github.com/originprotocol)\n\n• Communities:\n* Twitter: [https://twitter.com/OriginProtocol](https://twitter.com/OriginProtocol)\n* Medium: [https://blog.originprotocol.com/](https://blog.originprotocol.com/)\n* Defillama: [https://defillama.com/protocol/origin-ether](https://defillama.com/protocol/origin-ether)\n\n**Protocol Description:**\n\n[Origin Ether](https://www.oeth.com/) was launched in May 2023 and is an ERC20 LST aggregator that generates yield while sitting in your wallet by tapping into blue-chip protocols. OETH is backed 1:1 by ETH, WETH, stETH, rETH, and frxETH at all times; holders can go in and out of OETH as they please. Similar to stETH, OETH yield is automatically distributed at least once a day through a positive rebase in the form of additional OETH, proportional to the amount of OETH held.\n\nOETH yield comes from a combination of:\n\n1. Deploying collateral across various DeFi strategies including Balancer pools\n2. LST validator rewards\n3. A 50bip exit fee is charged to those who choose to exit OETH via the [vault contract](https://app.oeth.com/) (completely avoidable if using a DEX), this fee goes back to OETH holders\n4. By default, OETH sitting in smart contracts does not rebase, instead the interest generated from those tokens is provided to those that can rebase\n\nThese 4 yield generating functions combined enable OETH to generate higher yields than holding any single LST or farming ETH manually. The current collateral allocation and yield strategies can be seen on-chain at all times via the [OETH analytics page](https://www.oeth.com/analytics). More information on OETH and its mechanics can be found in the [OETH docs](https://docs.oeth.com/).\n\n**Motivation:**\n\nThe Balancer team has deployed the new OETH pool for us, [80OETH/20WETH](https://app.balancer.fi/#/1/pool/0x7056c8dfa8182859ed0d4fb0ef0886fdf3d2edcf000200000000000000000623), and 50 ETH of liquidity has already been [deposited](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x0d82b3357ffee2c3773f690a9fbd0c5c5930507e95e654390d225727d71b0d38). We chose to use an 80/20 pool since Origin is the largest LP and we are holding most of our capital in OETH.\n\nUp to a $13M deposit into the rETH Balancer pool has already [passed ratification](https://snapshot.org/#/ousdgov.eth/proposal/0x2ab3fd8727a268e3c0d14d9efa0ea19a2b6916415a47e7f816a5c328474342a9) in the Origin DAO and [has been allocated](https://etherscan.io/address/0x49109629ac1deb03f2e9b2fe2ac4a623e0e7dfdc#tokentxns) to the OETH Balancer strategy - a total deposit of 8,436.84 ETH, now worth over $17M. Two additional Balancer strategies have also already [passed ratification](https://vote.ousd.com/#/proposal/0x6948818628ecb112f8eacd13ea81e3c321464920f6ef34ef75f6e3f43e2cd375) in the DAO.\n\nOrigin has spent over [$8.5M on incentives](https://llama.airforce/#/bribes/rounds) in the Curve/Convex ecosystem and would like to similarly provide incentives to liquidity providers on Balancer. Origin’s Treasury is also holding several million dollars worth of CVX. Origin’s Treasury team is currently evaluating whether or not to make a similar investment in the Balancer ecosystem.\n\n**Specifications:**\n\n1. **Governance:** Origin Ether is governed by veOGV holders with any upgrades to the contracts being delayed by a 48-hour timelock. More details can be found at https://www.ousd.com/governance and in the [governance section](https://docs.oeth.com/governance/overview) of the OETH docs.\n\n2. **Oracles:** OETH is using Chainlink oracles for pricing data for rETH and stETH, and a dual oracle for frxETH that combines two sources: the Curve frxETH/ETH EMA oracle and the Uniswap frxETH/FRAX TWAP oracle. Please see the [oracle section](https://docs.oeth.com/core-concepts/price-oracles) of the OETH docs for more information.\n\n3. **Audits:** OETH was built reusing 95% of the [OUSD](https://ousd.com/) codebase, of which 10+ audits have been done since 2020. There have also been several OETH-specific audits. All audits can be seen in the [audits section](https://docs.oeth.com/security-and-risks/audits) of the OETH docs. OpenZeppelin is now on retainer to review 100% of OETH smart contract changes.\n\n4. **Centralization vectors:** With limited functionality, the [Strategists](https://docs.oeth.com/governance/admin-privileges) are tasked with rebalancing collateral between strategies or pausing deposits. However, a 48-hour timelock enforces a wait period before any changes to the OETH contracts can be executed. The timelock is the owner of our [ERC-20](https://docs.oeth.com/smart-contracts/architecture), [Vault](https://docs.oeth.com/smart-contracts/api/vault), and [Strategies](https://docs.oeth.com/smart-contracts/api/strategies) contracts. OETH currently accepts LSTs issued by Lido, RocketPool, and Frax which each have their own centralization risks.\n\n5. **Market History:** OETH currently has millions in total liquidity across [Curve](https://curve.fi/#/ethereum/pools/factory-v2-298/deposit), [Uniswap](https://info.uniswap.org/#/pools/0x52299416c469843f4e0d54688099966a6c7d720f), and [Maverick](https://app.mav.xyz/pool/0xa51822839bfa4685b27ad60305264a37eae28a68?chain=1).\n\n- Link to pool: [80OETH/20WETH](https://app.balancer.fi/#/1/pool/0x7056c8dfa8182859ed0d4fb0ef0886fdf3d2edcf000200000000000000000623)\n\n - Link to gauge: [80OETH/20WETH Gauge](https://etherscan.io/address/0x1c9E55ae29541F2D29cDf83a38F53e1143Db278E)\n\n6. **Value:** The OETH/WETH pool is intended to be a core OETH liquidity pool. Origin has already allocated a portion of its incentives budget to bribe this pool, and Balancer will benefit by attracting additional OETH liquidity.\n\nThe Balancer Maxi LM Multisig eth: 0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860 will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at 0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd and call the addGauge function with the following arguments:\n\n- gauge(address): 0x1c9E55ae29541F2D29cDf83a38F53e1143Db278E\n- gaugeType(string): Ethereum",

E-CLPs are custom pools from Gyroscope built on top of Balancer’s pool architecture. They enable trading along the curve of an ellipse. This pool type is ideally suited for liquid staking tokens, is typically more capital efficient and could thus generate significant trading volume.\n> * **The pool shall be a ‘Core’ pool with a swap fee of 1 basis points, i.e., 0.01% at pool inception**. The fee split is as follows: 50% of all collected fees will go to liquidity providers, while the remaining 50% will go towards Balancer. At pool inception, no fees will go towards Gyroscope.\n> * T**he pool has already been launched [here](https://etherscan.io/address/0xf01b0684C98CD7aDA480BFDF6e43876422fa1Fc1#code).**\n\n> ## References/Useful links\n> \n> * [Slidedeck on E-CLPs](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/16Qt-8PaLJ_1FkaNnI4rocEYUDrG1ktW3u4R6yeSwY68/edit#slide=id.g208e5b00ffd_0_95)\n> * [Documentation of E-CLPs](https://docs.gyro.finance/gyroscope-protocol/concentrated-liquidity-pools/e-clps#description-of-e-clps)\n> * [Website](https://gyro.finance/)\n> * [Github](https://github.com/gyrostable)\n> * [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/2vnqnS7wE6)\n\n> ## Protocol description\n> \n> * Lido's wrapped stETH (wstETH) is stETH which is deposited into the stETH wrapper to create a new token called wstETH. stETH is a token that represents staked ether in Lido, combining the value of initial deposit + staking rewards. stETH tokens are minted upon deposit and burned when redeemed. stETH token balances are issued 1:1 to the ethers that are staked by Lido. stETH token’s balances are updated when the oracle reports change in total stake every day. - [Lido](https://help.lido.fi/en/articles/5230610-what-is-steth)\n> * WETH is a wrapper-token and an ERC-20 token representing ETH at a 1:1 ratio.\n> * The E-CLP uses an [internal conversion](https://github.com/gyrostable/vaults/blob/main/contracts/eclp/GyroECLPPool.sol#L723) to avoid a unit drift of yield-accruing tokens.\n\n> ## Motivation\n> \n> * We expect the E-CLP to improve capital efficiency compared to the largest, existing [StableSwap pool](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0x32296969ef14eb0c6d29669c550d4a0449130230000200000000000000000080). The E-CLP’s efficiency gains are possible due to:\n> \n> * **Customizable liquidity profiles**: Using the curve of an ellipse enables highly customizable liquidity profiles. E-CLPs can be calibrated to approximate most trading curves that would be desired. E-CLP curves can be tailored to have certain regions of low price impact and other regions of high price impact.\n> * **Price bounds**: The E-CLP concentrates liquidity within price-bounds that enable the E-CLP to be highly capital-efficient. Functionally, this works by enabling arbitrary truncation of liquidity profiles from a given trading curve. In effect, the capital efficiency comes from bounding the trading curve to an expected trading range of the assets.\n\n> * *The E-CLP’s efficiency gains are illustrated by the recently deployed stMATIC/wMATIC E-CLP. The below box plot shows stMATIC/wMATIC liquidity utilisation. The stacked area chart shows how the E-CLP already reached up to 55% of the total market share of stMATIC on Polygon soon after inception, with only a fraction of total TVL.*\n> \n>  ![gyro1.png](ipfs://bafkreifpe3brj7btgkabof7if2zrm2huyd62xjky223schjnnkzo5d6fia)\n> \n>  ![gyro2.png](ipfs://bafybeifiprubxky4vdikxilkbt5joms4aaihk2b2r25jruimh6jb6xf6bu)\n> \n> * E-CLPs have been developed for stablecoin pools that include the upcoming Gyroscope stablecoin, GYD. However, they can find broader application, whenever the expected trading range of the included assets can be informed by external business logic (e.g. from arbitrage loops of mints/ redemptions in the case of LSTs).\n\n> ## Specifications\n> \n> > * **Governance**\n> > \n> >   The Gyroscope Protocol is in limited production live on Polygon. The Gyroscope Protocol will be governed by a DAO and relevant stakeholder with the full launch on Ethereum.

        "body": "### PR with Payload\nhttps://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/490\n\n# Proposal by Gyroscope\n\n> ## Summary\n> \n> * **This is a proposal to enable a 10% capped Balancer gauge for a wstETH/cbETH pool on Balancer Ethereum.**\n> * **The pool is an Elliptic Concentrated Liquidity Pool (E-CLP)**. E-CLPs are custom pools from Gyroscope built on top of Balancer’s pool architecture. They enable trading along the curve of an ellipse. This pool type is ideally suited for liquid staking tokens, is typically more capital efficient and could thus generate significant trading volume.\n> * **The pool shall be a ‘Core’ pool with a swap fee of 1 basis points, i.e., 0.01% at pool inception**. The fee split is as follows: 50% of all collected fees will go to liquidity providers, while the remaining 50% will go towards Balancer. At pool inception, no fees will go towards Gyroscope.\n> * **The pool has already been launched [here](https://etherscan.io/address/0xF7A826D47c8E02835D94fb0Aa40F0cC9505cb134).**\n\n> ## References/Useful links\n> \n> * [Slidedeck on E-CLPs](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/16Qt-8PaLJ_1FkaNnI4rocEYUDrG1ktW3u4R6yeSwY68/edit#slide=id.g208e5b00ffd_0_95)\n> * [Documentation of E-CLPs](https://docs.gyro.finance/gyroscope-protocol/concentrated-liquidity-pools/e-clps#description-of-e-clps)\n> * [Website](https://gyro.finance/)\n> * [Github](https://github.com/gyrostable)\n> * [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/2vnqnS7wE6)\n\n> ## Protocol description\n> \n> * Lido's wrapped stETH (wstETH) is stETH which is deposited into the stETH wrapper to create a new token called wstETH. stETH is a token that represents staked ether in Lido, combining the value of initial deposit + staking rewards. stETH tokens are minted upon deposit and burned when redeemed. stETH token balances are issued 1:1 to the ethers that are staked by Lido. stETH token’s balances are updated when the oracle reports change in total stake every day. - [Lido](https://help.lido.fi/en/articles/5230610-what-is-steth)\n> * Coinbase Wrapped Staked ETH (cbETH) represents your staked Ethereum (ETH) in a tradable form. You can unwrap cbETH at any time. cbETH provides flexibility to sell, transfer, or use it. You can move cbETH to a personal wallet and trade it outside the Coinbase platform. - [Coinbase](https://help.coinbase.com/en/coinbase/coinbase-staking/staking/cbeth-intro)\n> * The E-CLP uses an [internal conversion](https://github.com/gyrostable/vaults/blob/main/contracts/eclp/GyroECLPPool.sol#L723) to avoid a unit drift of yield-accruing tokens.\n\n> ## Motivation\n> \n> We expect the E-CLP to improve capital efficiency significantly. The E-CLP’s efficiency gains are possible due to:\n> \n> * **Customizable liquidity profiles**: Using the curve of an ellipse enables highly customizable liquidity profiles. E-CLPs can be calibrated to approximate most trading curves that would be desired. E-CLP curves can be tailored to have certain regions of low price impact and other regions of high price impact.\n> * **Price bounds**: The E-CLP concentrates liquidity within price-bounds that enable the E-CLP to be highly capital-efficient. Functionally, this works by enabling arbitrary truncation of liquidity profiles from a given trading curve. In effect, the capital efficiency comes from bounding the trading curve to an expected trading range of the assets.\n> \n\n> * The E-CLP’s efficiency gains are illustrated by the recently deployed stMATIC/wMATIC E-CLP. The below box plot shows stMATIC/wMATIC liquidity utilisation. The stacked area chart shows how the E-CLP already reached up to 55% of the total market share of stMATIC on Polygon soon after inception, with only a fraction of total TVL.\n> \n>  ![gyro1.png](ipfs://bafkreifpe3brj7btgkabof7if2zrm2huyd62xjky223schjnnkzo5d6fia)\n> \n>  ![gyro2.png](ipfs://bafybeifiprubxky4vdikxilkbt5joms4aaihk2b2r25jruimh6jb6xf6bu)\n> \n> * E-CLPs have been developed for stablecoin pools that include the upcoming Gyroscope stablecoin, GYD. However, they can find broader application, whenever the expected trading range of the included assets can be informed by external business logic (e.g. from arbitrage loops of mints/ redemptions in the case of LSTs).\n\n> ## Specifications\n> \n> > * **Governance**\n> > \n> >   The Gyroscope Protocol is in limited production live on Polygon. The Gyroscope Protocol will be governed by a DAO and relevant stakeholder with the full launch on Ethereum. For now, the FTL Labs multi-sig can pause the pool, change the swap fee and set the protocol fee. As a custom pool by Gyroscope, the E-CLP will be controlled by Gyroscope governance upon its launch.\n> > * **Oracles**\n> > \n>>   * rateProvider0 (for wstETH): [0x72D07D7DcA67b8A406aD1Ec34ce969c90bFEE768](https://etherscan.io/address/0x72D07D7DcA67b8A406aD1Ec34ce969c90bFEE768)\n>>   * rateProvider1 (for cbETH): [0x7311E4BB8a72e7B300c5B8BDE4de6CdaA822a5b1](https://etherscan.io/address/0x7311E4BB8a72e7B300c5B8BDE4de6CdaA822a5b1)\n>>   * (allows to control for a price drift from accruing yield by using rate providers to first convert from yield accruing tokens to the underlying)\n>>\n> >*  **Audits**\n> > \n> >    Audit reports by Nethermind, Trail of Bits, and Runtime Verification can be accessed [here](https://docs.gyro.finance/gyroscope-protocol/audit-reports) (the E-CLP is called the “CEMM” in these reports).

As such, stMATIC E-CLP volume is subject to some fluctuations, and it is often the dominant pool on high volume days (as aligns with the stacked area chart).\n>\n> * **The wstETH E-CLP on Optimism, however, has a lower swap fee of 1bp and is more oriented towards becoming a core trading pool** with the potential to take a significant share of the total wstETH volume on Optimism.\n> \n> * **E-CLPs have been developed for stablecoin pools that include the Gyroscope stablecoin, GYD.** However, they can find broader application, whenever the expected trading range of the included assets can be informed by external business logic (e.g. from arbitrage loops of mints/ redemptions in the case of LSTs)\n*** \n\n> As a new pool design with more customizable concentrated liquidity, this pool has the potential to significantly expand the BeethovenX offering. The pool design even supports asymmetric liquidity concentration. Current LSTs may be locked on Curve and Balancer, but are disproportionately traded on Uniswap and KyberSwap (c.f. below graphic).\n> \n> Gyroscope’s E-CLPs could change the LST landscape of BeethovenX by becoming low-slippage trading pools. However, some initial incentives may be required to bootstrap the pool and get to a minimum TVL that unlocks the pool’s potential. As demonstrated by the [stMATIC E-CLP](https://app.gyro.finance/pools/polygon/e-clp/0xf0ad209e2e969eaaa8c882aac71f02d8a047d5c2/), this amount, although necessary, does not need to be that large for the pool to be competitive, after which the pool can grow organically.\n> \n> \n> *Snapshot data for Ethereum as per 02/23/2023 including LSDs of Lido, Rocketpool, and Coinbase*\n\n*** \n\n# Specifications\n\n* ## Governance\n\n> The Gyroscope Protocol is in limited production live on Polygon.
