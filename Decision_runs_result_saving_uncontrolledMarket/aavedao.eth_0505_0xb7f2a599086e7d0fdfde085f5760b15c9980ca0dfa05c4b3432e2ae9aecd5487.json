Those same LP positions can be deposited into other protocols to earn yield without the prospect of being slashed. These alternative investment options create an opportunity cost and act as a minimum APY hurdle rate when considering investing in Aave’s SM.\n\nThis publication presents an opportunity to enable participants in the Aave SM to earn rewards from other protocols whilst providing a backstop to Aave. The inclusion of GHO pools further helps provide sustained liquidity in the market and generate revenue for Aave through GHO’s borrow rate.\n\nThis introduces the prospect of increasing the sustainability of the SM by enabling rewards to scale with TVL over time which is currently solely dependent upon AAVE’s price correlation with the SM’s TVL given the fixed distribution limitation.\n\nThis proposal will discuss the differences between “classic” gauges and specific ones (“smBPT gauges”) as outlined in the [intro post](https://governance.aave.com/t/discussion-safety-module/12029/6?u=dydymoon), and will introduce the strategy.\n\n# Motivation\n\nThe Balancer Liquidity Mining system is an automated program which governs the minting of all BAL tokens based on on-chain voting by veBAL holders. veBAL is obtained by joining the canonical 80/20 BAL/ETH Weighted Pool and then locking the Pool shares token (often called BPT, for ‘Balancer Pool Token’) for a time duration up to 1 year. The longer the 80/20 BPT is locked for, the more veBAL and voting power is obtained.\n\nBalancer token emission is currently at 121,930 BAL/week and decreases linearly each year.\n\nveBAL holders can vote each week to redirect part of these incentives to the pool of their choice.\n\nAt the time of writing, 1 veBAL can redirect 0.01187 BAL /veBAL vote/week ($0.0851).\n\nBy using the voting power & voting incentives, it is possible to either leverage better rewards for the similar $$ cost or similar APR rewards with reduced cost. Our calculations are based on delivering a similar APR to users whilst reducing the overall dollar spend on the SM.\n\nLike Curve, the APR of liquidity pools staked on Balancer (BPT-XX-gauge) can be boosted up 2.5x depending on several parameters, such as veBAL boost holdings, value deposited, total TVL of the pool etc. However, having the max boost requires a huge amount of veBAL, which most projects don’t have.\n\nWhile they can still buy boosts on Marketplace like Warden, it can be expensive and potentially limitate the strategy profitability. However, there are projects accumulating a considerable amount of veTokens to mutualize the boost, improving the yield for depositors.\n\nAura Finance is the biggest on the Balancer ecosystem with [27% of the veBAL held by the protocol](https://www.defiwars.xyz/wars/balancer). These holdings are utilized to boost the users deposits (Most of the pools are currently boosted ~1.4x).\n\nIt’s important to note that 25% of all BAL earned on Aura are captured by the protocol, which distributes AURA rewards in return, the Aura Finance governance token. More details on the AURA distribution can be found [here](https://docs.aura.finance/aura/usdaura/distribution).\n\nThe AURA token can be locked for 4 months for vlAURA without decay on the voting power, which allows to participate on Aura Governance, Balancer gauges votes as it controls the underlying veBAL voting power, and can receive rewards in auraBAL & vote incentives. At this time, 1 vlAURA controls 0.2081 veBAL. Once a gauge is voted on Balancer, the pool is added on Aura Finance in the following days.\n\nThe goal of this proposal is to consider staking the LPs deposited in the SM on Aura Finance, to receive BAL + AURA rewards distributed to SM depositors. However, there are different possibilities to reach this goal:\n\n## “Classic” gauges mechanism\n\nAfter a liquidity pool is created, an application is shared on the respective communities governance forum to create a gauge. Upon creation, users are able to deposit their LPs into the gauges to earn rewards.\n\nProjects like Aura Finance receive the BPTs, deposit them into the Balancer gauge and retain a portion of the BAL emission in exchange of their own governance token. Users receive an elevated yield to reward users for the additional smart contract risk and premium for replacing BAL with AURA. Aave could deploy contracts within the SM that extends this concept and enable users to receive Aura Finance and Balancer rewards.\n\nMost projects are proposing to enable the gauge on the BPT assets. This works quite well because they are creating vote incentives (often with their native token) to acquire votes in veBAL & wrappers, directing more rewards to the pool, making it attractive for the community to deposit liquidity.\n\nHowever, if Aave’s SM was to accept the BPT directly and not deposit the BPT into the Balancer Gauge. Any users could deposit & stake their BPT to receive BPT-gauge without depositing in the SM, allowing them to bypass the SM lock period and cooldown to receive the same incentives as SM depositors, so classic gauges invalidates the strategy\n\nThis would create a huge dilution for Aave, which is a large issue when the liquidity also doubles as protocol insurance. If Aave was to offer the same APR as Aura Finance there is no incentive for users to take on the additional shortfall and cool down period lock up risk/opportunity cost.\n\nIn Part IV, the SM upgrade proposal will consider using 75% of the current incentives budget for volatile & stable BPTs categories. That’s 825 AAVE/ day that could either be used to incentivize the pools directly (Not recommended to keep doing liquidity mining for all categories) or to create vote incentives for the associated gauges driving a higher rewards value to the pools.\n\nThis method can still be used for main liquidity pools outside of the SM, but to keep the proposed strategy profitable for Aave, an alternative could be what this publication will refer to as “smBPT gauges” which is a suggestion from Solarcurve.\n\n## “smBPT gauges mechanism”\n\nThe method requires implementing a wrapper in the safety module. The SM contract receives BPT from users, and deposits in the wrapper contract which would mint smBPT received by the SM.\n\nInstead of enabling gauges that accept the BPT, Balancer can approve BAL emissions to gauges which accept the smBPT. Users would have the option to deposit the BPT into Aave’s SM to mint smBPT which will be deposited on Aura Finance which then deposits the smBPT into the Balancer gauge.\n\nThis means that any users could deposit liquidity and receive the trading fees on the underlying Balancer pools, but only users who stake their BPT in the SM would be eligible to gauge rewards.\n\nIf the smBPT gauges are approved by the Balancer DAO, Aura Finance will implement the pools associated with these gauges. The gauges will only accept smBPT. This eliminates the opportunity cost as users can not deposit into Aura Finance or Balancer’s gauge directly and avoid the slashing plus cool down risk. Considering that the SM would mint the smBPT internally, it would be the only contract available to stake on this gauge.\n\nOnce deposited, the SM contract would receive “aurasmBPT-gauge” and mint “StkaurasmBPT-gauge” distributed to the initial BPT depositors.\n\nIf a user wants to withdraw from the SM, he would activate the cooldown period. The SM contract would then burn the “aurasmBPT-gauge” by unstaking from Aura Finance to receive smBPT. It would then unlock and distribute the BPT as well as burn the smBPT and “StkaurasmBPT-gauge” once the withdrawal is done.\n\nAt this point, and while several aspects of the proposals have been updated since the strategy introduction post, this chart should help understand and visualize the overall strategy described.\n\n ![image](ipfs://bafkreih2bqouhr75txq5jog2gi4xdstlorn7wb3qdhjkzhlmhem6ojn7ey)\n    \nConsidering that the veBAL voting power held by Aave is not enough to sustain these pools with good TVL, the goal is to use part of the SM rewards budget as votes incentives.\n\nThe part IV of this proposal will focus on incentives management updates and details on estimations made, while the part V will be mostly about further considerations.\n\n## smBPT Risks\n\nTo implement interoperability and integrate different protocols, several changes are needed, which will result in the upgraded SM contracts having greater smart contract risk than in the current implementation. Introducing smBPT to the SM creates additional Balancer gauge and Aura smart contract risk exposure.\n\nThe current ABPT integration demonstrates the community's willingness to have exposure to the Balancer protocol within the SM. Aave further demonstrated confidence in the Balancer <> Aave partnership via the token swap performed during 2022. Since then, Balancer has launched several liquidity pools which deposit funds in Aave v3 across several networks. Further, BGD has already proposed upgrading to Balancer V2 and Aave Companies have recently [proposed including BPT assets as collateral.](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-staked-atokens-a-new-aave-primitive-exploring-vote-escrow-economies/10406)\n\nAave and Balancer have been working together since the launch of the Safety Module. Further, BGD has already proposed upgrading to Balancer V2 and Aave Companies have recently [proposed including BPT assets as collateral.](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-staked-atokens-a-new-aave-primitive-exploring-vote-escrow-economies/10406)\n\nAura Finance is a protocol built on top of the[ Balancer system](https://app.balancer.fi/#/) to provide maximum incentives to Balancer liquidity providers and BAL stakers (into[ veBAL](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/introducing-vebal-tokenomics/2512)) through social aggregation of BAL deposits and Aura’s native token. Even if the protocol is relatively young (launched on June 3, 2022), the team has an extensive focus on security, having run 3 [audits](https://docs.aura.finance/aura/security#audits): [Peckshield](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1S5jnMddjbVUsAdVZtmcIRlL4WhVueSzp/view), [Halborn,](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vsZ9aAVJ8mobLaJ5-XDejcHdRFK1StjM/view) [Code4rena](https://github.com/aurafinance/aura-contracts/blob/main/audits/Code4rena-Audit-Report-AuraFinance-v1.0.pdf)\n\nAura started a $1 million [bug bounty program on Immunefi](https://immunefi.com/bounty/aurafinance/) on June 16, 2022 and to date, no vulnerabilities have been found.\n\nMoreover, Aura was given a rating of [88% from DeFiSafety](https://defisafety.com/app/pqrs/526) which also suggested improvements to protocol documentation (actively being worked on now by contributors).\n\nFinally, some security researchers and developers are closely looped into Aura via its multisig, and general protocol oversight.\n\n## Smart Contract Considerations\n\nAave Governance as admin, can perform the following:\n\n* Add/remove assets into the SM\n* Invoke Emergency power to withdraw of all funds deployed by the SM on Aura\n* Update reward budget influencing the SM yield\n* Update the slashing parameters & associated yield ranges\n\nAave SM as admin, can perform the following:\n\n* Receive BPT and mint smBPT\n* Deposit/withdraw smBPT from Aura\n* Mint/Burn smBPT and aurasmBPT-XX-gauge\n* Claim BAL & AURA rewards\n* Redistribute the rewards to StkaurasmBPT-XX-gauge or StkTokens holders (This can probably done weekly/bi-weekly)\n\n# Technical Specifications\n\n* Deploy wrapper contract to wrap BPT into smBPT (BGD)\n* Enable gauges on smBPT voted in Part I & II.

Currently, the SM is overly concentrated in AAVE via direct AAVE staking and ABPT staking which is a Balancer v1 80/20 AAVE/wETH liquidity token.\n\nThis publication seeks to explore the community's appetite to diversify the SM asset base and vary the portion of users' funds which can be auctioned in the event of a shortfall. Currently, 30% of user deposits are at risk when depositing into the SM.\n\n# Motivation\n\n@bgdlabs is currently proposing to upgrade the [SM architecture](https://governance.aave.com/t/bgd-aave-safety-module-v1-5/12148) to support the launch of GHO, by enabling stkAAVE holders to access cheaper GHO borrowing rates. Further to this, Llama has kick started the conversation around migrating AAVE liquidity from Balancer v1 to v2 in this [forum post](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-safety-module-update-part-i-migrate-aave-weth-balancer-v1-pool-to-balancer-v2/12748).\n\nSeveral comments relating to the AAVE concentration and auction mechanism have been made on the forum which can be found [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/size-x-aave-auction-safety-module/11984), [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/discussion-safety-module/12029) and [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-extend-safety-module-coverage-to-polygon-v3/11876/4).\n\nThis publication presents three distinct categories for inclusion in the SM.\n\n* Single Asset\n* Volatile Asset Liquidity Positions\n* Stable Asset Liquidity Positions\n\nThe net change to the existing implementation is the introduction of a third category, Stable Asset Liquidity Positions. The existing AAVE and ABPT represent Single Asset and Volatile Asset Liquidity Positions.\n\nAlthough any Liquidity Provider (LP) position can be included, G-Uni, crvLP, BPT etc… This publication will initially focus on the overarching concept and how BPTs could be integrated.\n\nBPTs were selected due to Aave’s relationship with Balancer DAO and the veBAL holding which the community may elect to utilize here. It should be stressed, Aave DAO will elect which assets are to be included and the varying levels of slashing for each category.\n\nAssets considered for inclusion should have minimal counterparty risk and display great on-chain liquidity amongst other considerations such as price correlation with Aave Protocol’s TVL during varying market conditions.\n\nLlama proposes three initial asset categories to be created within the SM.\n\nThe slashing parameters update aims to reduce the price impact on the AAVE token in the case of a shortfall event. We propose adding different levels of slashing to each category, as follows:\n\n## Single Assets\n\nThe current single asset, with 30% slashing, is AAVE. This proposal introduces other assets to this category with the goal of reducing the concentration of AAVE inside the insurance fund.\n\nPossible assets for consideration inside the SM Single Asset Category include, not limited to:\n\n* AAVE\n* ETH and/or wstETH\n\nIf the community elects with the introduction of additional assets other than AAVE, then each asset could be considered individually. This publication retains the 30% slashing feature for Single Asset.\n\nThe inclusion of wstETH may attract additional incentives from Lido DAO, therefore Llama prefers having the ability to distribute multiple rewards types with external teams able to distribute their own token. Something similar to the Emission Admin role on Aave v3 will suffice.\n\nLlama preference is for wstETH over wETH due to improved capital efficiency by enabling users to earn an overall higher APY from being a SM depositor. wstETH has become a major trading pairing token on Balancer and it has ample liquidity across various pools to route swaps through. Additionally, the stETH-ETH discount has reduced significantly (0.9938:1 for 100K ETH sold, which also demonstrates [very deep liquidity](https://swap.defillama.com/?chain=ethereum&from=0xae7ab96520de3a18e5e111b5eaab095312d7fe84&to=0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000).\n\nLlama would also encourage Lido DAO to indicate any potential support for this type of integration between the two protocols as inclusion in the SM would act to help retain or grow wstETH adoption via the creation of a unique use case for wstETH relative to other LSTs.\n\nMax slashing proposed: 30% retained for single assets.\n\nInitial assets proposed: AAVE / ETH and/or stETH\n\n## Risks Considerations\n\nIf LSTs (such as wstETH) are included in the SM, it creates a price divergence risk which, if sustained, can reduce the cover in the SM and create an unfair distribution of the rewards between ETH & wstETH. Post redemption the main risk consideration for LSTs becomes counterparty risk which if it materialized would lead to a significant discount to the LST price in ETH terms.\n\n* To limit the de-peg risk, the SM could stop incentivizing below a defined ratio, so the total value would then be deduced from the total cover value. This acts to mitigate counterparty risk without requiring governance intervention.\n\nBased upon technical feedback relating to the ease of implementation, Llama may revise this section of the publication.\n\n## Volatile Liquidity Provider Tokens\n\nIn addition to the replacement pool for the 80/20 AAVE/wETH pool on Balancer v1, to be determined by an earlier publication. This publication presents two other pools of strategic importance to Aave DAO for inclusion in the SM.\n\nThis publication presents the prospect of creating an 80/20 GHO/wETH (or wstETH) which offers less impermanent loss than a 50/50 pool whilst also providing very deep liquidity for risk off events which see spikes in stable coin swap volumes which can often lead to stable coins trading above $1.\n\nFor the following categories, up to 75% of the current budget could be allocated.\n\nMax slashing proposed 45% for volatile BPTs\n\nInitial volatile BPTs proposed: B-80AAVE-20wstETH (or Part I proposal results) & B-80GHO-20WETH\n\nEven if not yet created, this is probably the most interesting addition to this category as the trading volume of this pool will generate an important yield for LPs. The second pool could also be converted into a [Balancer Core Pool](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-19-incentivize-core-pools-l2-usage/3329) by replacing ETH by IBTs as described in Part I.\n\n## Stable Liquidity Provider Tokens\n\nIn this third category, this publication presents an initial pool consisting of the Balancer [3pool](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0x79c58f70905f734641735bc61e45c19dd9ad60bc0000000000000000000004e7) and GHO. Like other categories, in the future, additional assets can be added. If the community elects to launch BB-A-USD/GHO on Balancer or a stable coin pool on Curve, then this section can pivot to include the Curve pool.\n\nMax slashing proposed: 60% for stable\n\nInitial Stable BPT proposed: B-3Pool/GHO\n\nThis pool introduces a stable asset to the SM design and generates a significant amount of the coverage as 60% of the TVL can be slashed with very low price impact across the broader ecosystem. This is especially the case if something like Cowswap’s auction mechanism was to feature in the new SM auction mechanism.\n\nBy integrating a GHO pair to the SM, Aave is essentially helping bootstrapping GHO adoptions through incentivised liquidity. Aave will also earn revenue from the GHO borrowing rate.\n\nIf the community elects to proceed with 3CRV/GHO, then this would increase the SM smart contract surface area through diversifying exposure concentration away from Balancer to include Cuve Finance and potentially Convex Finance risk as well.\n\nThere is also the option of adding additional pools which could include GHO, MAI, LUSD, FRAX and others once live like crvUSD etc…\n\nThis proposal can be implemented independently from the following parts. In this case, “classic” gauges would be advised. Otherwise, the strategy & smBPT gauges discussions will be outlined & discussed in Part III.\n\n# Technical Specifications:\n\n* Remove the BPT 80/20 from the current main module (30% slashing)\n* Deploy two other modules on the SM for the new categories (45% & 60% slashing)\n* Implement the new assets voted on Part II for the new categories\n* Create the new pools depending on vote results\n\n# Voting Options\n\nYAE - Implement Changes\nNAE- Rework Proposal\nABSTAIN\n\n# Disclaimer\n\nThe Llama is not compensated by any of the mentioned communities outside of Aave.\n\nLlama is an unpaid delegate within the Balancer ecosystem.\n\nMembers who contributed to this proposal are not angel investors or advisors to any of the mentioned communities but some do hold small holdings in those communities tokens.\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n\n# References\n\n1.

        "body": "---\n\n[ARFC] Deploy BAL & aBAL from the Collector Contract\nAuthor: @llamaxyz - DeFi_Consulting (@MatthewGraham) and @dydymoon\nCreated: 2023-02-05 (updated)\n\n---\n\n# Simple Summary\n\nThis proposal presents two options for deploying the approximately 100k BAL tokens being acquired by AIP 115 and the aBAL holding in the Ethereum Collector Contract, [1].\n\n# Abstract\n\nAIP 115 has been successfully implemented and Aave has acquired an additional 100k BAL on market. The total BAL and aBAL holding is now 308,978.30. With 200k BAL already committed to veBAL, this proposal will determine how to deploy the remaining 108,978.30 BAL with the overall objective of maximizing the growth potential of Aave, [4,16].\n\nAave Snapshot voters can choose between two options, each of which has varying degrees of complexity and represents different means of achieving similar goals over different time horizons.\n\nOption 1) Locking veBAL.\nOption 2) Staking auraBAL.\n\nOption 1) is about locking B-80BAL-20WETH enabling Aave to participate in Balancer gauge and governance votes, and benefit from the Liquidity Provider (LP) boosting and protocol fees earnings.\n\nOption 2) focuses on yield, forgoes governance influence (participating in votes) and presents a higher yield investment strategy that over time, will lead to more governance influence relative to Option 1).\n\nA Snapshot will be posted enabling the community to choose between both options. Llama recommends voting for Option 1).\n\n# Motivation\n\nThis BAL holding has been acquired by the Aave with the goal of supporting Aave lending market adoption. In pursuit of driving growth to the Aave markets, the BAL holding needs to be deployed and utilised.\n\nAave has the following BAL and aBAL holdings on Ethereum:\n\n* 200k BAL acquired via a token swap with Balancer DAO, [1].\n* 100k BAL acquired via an on market acquisition swap contract, [4].\n* 8,978.30 aBAL acquired through user borrowing BAL on Aave, [10].\n\nThis proposal will focus on how best to deploy the 100k BAL and 8,978.30 aBAL.\n\n## Option 1) Locking veBAL\n\nThe Balancer Liquidity Mining system is an automated program which governs the minting of all BAL tokens based on on-chain voting by veBAL holders. veBAL is obtained by joining the canonical 80/20 BAL/ETH Weighted Pool and then locking the Pool shares token (often called BPT, for 'Balancer Pool Token') for a time duration. The longer the 80/20 BPT is locked for, the more veBAL and voting power is obtained.\n\nIn Option 1), Aave DAO converts all BAL (incl. Redeem aBAL for BAL) with sufficient WETH to B-80BAL-20WETH. The B-80BAL-20WETH token is then deposited into the VotingEscrow veBAL contract and locked for the maximum duration, 1 year. This proposal will acquire the B-80BAL-20WETH and explain the goals of utilising the veBAL holdings while a separate proposal will detail how the veBAL is to be managed before being deployed to veBAL.\n\n### What’s veBAL ?\n\nveBAL are not transferable and the voting influence decays on the veTokens balance over time requiring the veBAL to be relocked periodically to maintain maximum voting influence. The B-80BAL-20WETH can be locked from 1 week to 1 year. Ie: 1 B-80BAL-20WETH locked 1 year = 1 veBAL, locked 6 months = 0,5 veBAL etc\n\n* **Gauge-weight Power**\nVoting power which influences the BAL emissions on the different gauges. The votes happen every week on Balancer governance. It can be used for several goals which will be described later on this post.\n\n* **Governance Power**\nVoting influence in Balancer DAO proposals. Since Balancer DAO utilities off-chain governance, the voting power can be delegated via Snapshot. Note: Llama is currently a Balancer DAO delegate.\n\n* **veBoost**\nLocking B-80BAL-20WETH earns a boost of up to 2.5x on the liquidity provided on Balancer.\n\n* **Protocol Fees**\n75% of all trading fees consolidated for bb-a-USD (stable) + BAL coming from the veBAL gauge are distributed to lockers, [9].\n\n### veBAL Position Overview\n\nBy maximising the veBAL holding and using over 308.9K BAL with the proportional amount of WETH (326.88) for a combined worth of $2,719,000 at the time of writing, Aave would receive an estimated ~153,520.38 units of B-80BAL-20WETH. Converted to veBAL, the ~153,520.38 units would represent approximately 1.10% of the BPT liquidity and 1.40% of the veBAL supply. Aave would be one of the largest veBAL holders along with Aave Companies, [5].\n\nWith 145,000 BAL tokens currently being minted and distributed each week across four networks and Aave holding 1.40% of veBAL supply, this is equivalent to controlling the distribution of 2036 BAL per week, or $14,496 per week ($753,8080 per year, assuming a BAL price $7.12).\n\nBAL emissions reduce yearly as per the inflation schedule and the next reduction will occur at the end of March 2023, pivoting from 145,000 to 121,930 BAL/week. With 2023 emission and the same veBAL share, Aave would be able to redirect 1,712 BAL/week, or $12,189 per week or $633,850 per year, assuming a BAL price at $7.12.\n\nAave can utilise its veBAL holdings to support, not limited to, the below strategies:\n\n* Redirect incentives on existing Balancer pools\n* Optimise the yield on treasury strategies\n* Bootstrap the Staked aToken Reserves\n* Grow and sustain the GHO liquidity\n* Help sustain the Safety Module yield\n\nThe boost amount received depends on the value of the funds deposited and the relative sizing of the veBAL holding. The boost can be used directly on the Collector Contract but considering the amounts of available funds, the boost is unlikely to be sufficient to boost all of Aave’s positions in Balancer Liquidity Pools. Therefore, it is likely any treasury strategies will be a mix of both depositing into Balancer gauges directly or via Aura Finance.\n\nThere remains the possibility to sell the veBoost on secondary markets like Warden, [6].\n\n### veBAL yield overview\n\nThe veTokens yield can vary a lot depending on several parameters:\n\n* bb-a-USD fees depends on the trading volume (Swap fee: 0.67% APR)\n* BAL rewards are coming from the veBAL gauge (BAL rewards: up to 0.91% APR)\n* The veBoost yield is hard to estimate as it won’t be the same if used on POL (up to 2.5x the yield), or sold\n\nIn the second case, the current minimum price listed on Warden is 0.00014 BAL/veBAL/week\n\nveBoost if sold: from 0.27% APR with a BAL price of 7.14$ and a veBAL price of $18.92\n\n* Bribes: The biggest variation on the veBAL yield comes from the bribes received for the gauge weight power. Last week, the average cost was ~$0.085/veBAL vote/week. Gauges weight APR: 23.3%.\n\nIt’s important to note that the yield impact is better when some funds are deployed in strategies, farming boosted rewards on the pools voted.\n\n## Option 2) Staking auraBAL\n\nOption 2) maximises earning whilst forgoing Aave’s ability to participate in BAL emission distribution votes. Both Option 1) and 2) involve obtaining the B-80BAL-20WETH position.\n\nAfter the B-80BAL-20WETH position is obtained, Aave could deposit it into Aura Finance’s auraBAL wrapper contract to earn staking yield in the several forms (1.87% stables (bb-a-USD), 24.09% in BAL and 34.59% in AURA for a total of 60.56% APR), [8].\n\nDepositing into the B-80BAL-20WETH/Aura pool and staking the BPT was considered, however this is more complex to execute and maintain for margin additional yield.\n\nThe yield received from the auraBAL holding can be compounded to earn additional yield.\n\n* BAL (24.09% of 60.56%): BAL, aBAL and WETH from the Collector Contract can be swapped for B-80BAL-20WETH and staked on Aura Finance.\n* bb-a-USD (1.87% of 60.56%): bb-a-USD can be deposited on Aura to earn 6.53% in (0.06% swap fees, 0.83% bb-a-USD, 2.30% BAL, 3.35% AURA).\n* AURA (34.67% of 60.32%): AURA can be locked for vlAURA and used to vote where BAL and AURA incentives will be directed. The vlAURA position generates around 3.34% in auraBAL as well as gives vote weight for proposal and gauge weight voting, [11]. The vlAURA lock period is 16 weeks and 4 days, depending on locking date and after this time, the AURA can be redeemed and swapped.\n\nGrowing a vlAURA position over time in addition to the veBAL one will increase the total voting power controlled over time, which will help to drive TVL to Aave markets and generate more earnings.\n\nWith 200K BAL from the token swap + WETH to be deposited in veBAL and 108,978.30 BAL + WETH into the auraBAL staking contract, Aave will own ~54,220 auraBAL and ~99,600 veBAL.\n\nBy staking 54,220 auraBAL, Aave DAO will hold approximately 1,99% of the auraBAL supply, [7].\n\nOption 2) is focused on depositing B-80BAL-20WETH on Aura to earn more BAL & AURA rewards.\n\n## Comments\n\nTo help with the decision making, the table below presents some pros and cons of each approach. The TL;DR: veBAL has an immediate impact whilst auraBAL is a longer term, higher return strategy that compounds over time.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/JasIpLf.png)\n\nLlama suggests Option 1) to focus on accumulating voting power as soon as possible, to support all possibilities mentioned above.\n\nThere are several more advanced strategies to which Aave could deploy assets to grow its strategic voting power over time which will be detailed in the RF strategies deployment proposal.\n\nIt is reasonable to think that, in time, AURA could be listed as collateral on Aave, generating aAURA revenue which could also be used to bolster this strategy. The compounding effects of using Aave’s revenue stream presents a unique opportunity to gain influence in how BAL and AURA incentives are distributed.\n\n# Implementation\n\nThis section has been up dated and uses data from early March 2023 which differs from older data mentioned earlier in this post.\n\nTo summarise, the below shows the current BAL and wETH to be swapped to B-80BAL-20WETH.\n\n|Asset|Amount|Price|Value|\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|BAL|309,102.07|$6.61|$2,043,756.21|\n|wETH|326.31|$1,565.79|$510,939.05|\n|B-80BAL-20wETH|||$2,554,695.26|\n\nThe amount of B-80BAL-20WETH received is estimated to be 152,617.94 units valued at\n\nLlama proposes the following methodology for obtaining the B-80BAL-20WETH holding:\n\n1. Redeem 326.31 awETH for wETH\n2. Approve 326.31 wETH on Cowswap\n3. Swap all 326.31 WETH to BAL. This routing minimises slippage.\n![|307x257](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/91M03SGqVM-CY3EA640gypvHrKToAMDGkze_9_55Ac9ZuOH3fB16bQXc50YjlxsgHbp0auh2pd7aLjNmdjzWevNnyB1zOurqwNRuO88x1VtW4MvifbzV8tVuIo3Ec8icnAPyZ4qj5rtrNUYsMiIfR_Q)\nThe BAL holdings are now 78,011.66 + 309,102.07 = 387,113.73 BAL\n4.

The B-80BAL-20WETH can be deposited into the voter escrow contract and locked to create a veBAL holding for Aave.\n\nAt the time of writing there are [14,133,907](https://dune.com/balancerlabs/veBAL) units of B-80BAL-20WETH in circulating supply backed by 28,685,996 BAL and 29,196 wETH valued at $235,329,238.4 or $16.65/unit of B-80BAL-20WETH.\n\n152,617.94*16.65 = $2,541,088.70\n$2,541,088.70 - $2,554,695.26 = -$13,606.56\n\nIn performing the above transactions, Aave incurs $13,606.56 (0.53%) of price impact (slippage) in converting 309,102.07 units of BAL and 326.31 units of wETH.\n\nFor comparison purposes, the Balancer veBAL tool generates 153,121.46 units of B-80BAL-20WETH for depositing 309,102 units of BAL and 323 units of wETH. Using this reference data, Aave would incur 0.33% of price impact. This is reflective of the estimated difference in B-80BAL-20WETH received between Cowswap and [Balancer’s veBAL Tool](https://balancer.tools/veBAL).\n\nThe number above are accurate at the time the post was drafted and shared for review. The final numbers to be used will be based upon the actual BAL and aBAL holding at the time.\n\n\n\n# Future Considerations\n\nThe above proposal focuses on whether Aave’s preference is for maximum governance influence or yield. Depending upon which direction Aave elects to proceed, there will be various other considerations and discussions that emerge.\n\nThose considerations are:\n\n* Determine how to use the veBAL and/or vlAURA holdings, GHO, staked aToken pools, pools include in the Safety Module upgrade\n* Implementation of meta-governance, via Snapshot, AIP, multi-sig etc…, [3,4]\n* Continual conversion of aBAL and awETH to veBAL, if Option 1) is voted\n\n# References\n\n[1] https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/115\n[2] https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/QmVqWgpRmoEvvhvXZFepmAgYU5ZK9XpSs39MExEUpiJZw3\n[3] https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/87/\n[4] https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-bal-interest-rate-curve-upgrade/10484/19\n[5] https://dune.com/queries/782195/1395498\n[6] https://app.warden.vote/dashboard/\n[7] https://etherscan.io/tx/0x94ac1109d58b02b5b74f10d92fb816a9cdc4b198fd455cc2bb2fdbb52ae84f9e\n[8] https://etherscan.io/token/0x616e8BfA43F920657B3497DBf40D6b1A02D4608d?a=0x5e5ea2048475854a5702f5b8468a51ba1296efcc\n[9] https://dev.balancer.fi/resources/deploy-pools-from-factory/creation/aavelinearpool\n[10] https://etherscan.io/token/0x272f97b7a56a387ae942350bbc7df5700f8a4576?a=0x464c71f6c2f760dda6093dcb91c24c39e5d6e18c\n[11] https://app.aura.finance/#/lock\n[12] https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0x3dd0843a028c86e0b760b1a76929d1c5ef93a2dd000200000000000000000249\n[13] https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0, [13].",

The ABPT is a 80/20 AAVE/wETH Balancer v1 liquidity pool receipt token. Balancer v1 is now obsolete and the main AAVE liquidity pool requires migrating. This publication presents several pool options to consider when migration of the main decentralized exchange (DEX) AAVE liquidity pool and if the receipt token (ABPT) should be included in Aave’s SM.\n\nGiven Balancer DAO has adopted a veTokenomics model, if the new AAVE liquidity pool was to receive a gauge and incentives then this would represent an alternative yield source that does not incur any risk of shortfall. This is an important consideration when estimating the cost of renting users backstop liquidity within the SM.\n\nThis publication seeks to determine what liquidity pools should be created on Balancer v2 and if those ABPTs are to be included within Aave’s SM.\n\n# Motivation\n\nBy depositing AAVE and ABPT into the SM, depositors receive stkAAVE and stkBPT respectively, along with yield nominated in AAVE. 550 AAVE are distributed daily to users who stake AAVE and another 550 AAVE is distributed daily to depositors who stake ABPT. In return for the AAVE yield, depositors are risking up to 30% of their capital by providing a backstop for the Aave liquidity pools.\n\nCurrently, the ABPT accepted in the SM is representative of a liquidity position on Balancer v1, 80/20 AAVE/wETH. The initial portion of this proposal is to focus on if the AAVE liquidity is to be migrated to Balancer v2 and if so, what pool composition should be considered. For the remainder of this publication, it is assumed Aave seeks to continue having the primary AAVE liquidity pool on Balancer protocol and other DEX providers are not considered,\n\nThis publication excludes BPTs featuring Balancer Linear boosted Pools which deposit funds into Aave v3 deployments from inclusion in the Aave SM due to the systemic risk of using deposits in Aave as backstop for Aave. This pool type is still worthy of consideration for being the main AAVE liquidity pool, or for the StakedATokens but without being accepted into the SM.\n\nNon-Aave Boosted pool pairs were also excluded from this proposal during the initial review due to the increased risk surface area spanning beyond Balancer and Aave Protocols, but could still be considered if the community decides it, as long as the underlying strategy is fully unrelated to Aave. There are alternative means of improving the capital efficiency for liquidity providers with better risk reward trade-offs. An example is established and battle tested Liquid Staking Tokens (LST).\n\nConsidering the SM is over exposed to the AAVE token, the following options will focus on reducing the AAVE weights and explaining the pros & cons for each option. This publication presents the following four Balancer v2 liquidity pools options for discussion:\n\n**1. 80/20 AAVE/wETH**\nLike for like pool migrating v1 to v2\n**2. 80/20 AAVE/wstETH**\nLike for like migration with improved capital efficiency\n\nIn the future, an AAVE/GHO pool could be created and introduced for consideration in the SM.\n\n## Option 1 - 80/20 AAVE/wETH\n\nThis option only requires to recreate the same pool on v2 and for users to migrate.\n\n## Option 2 - 80/20 AAVE/wstETH\n\nOption 2 is the same as Option 1 whilst replacing the unproductive wETH with wstETH. There is additional risk to consider with the inclusion of an LST relative to wETH and the additional yield it offers Liquidity Providers.\n\nConsidering the Shanghai upgrade date is confirmed, the risks on LST de-peg and liquidity will be reduced over time, which would make it a good asset in the SM.\n\n# Discussion\n\nLlama suggests keeping the 80/20 composition of the v1 Balancer pool and replacing wETH with wstETH when deploying the new Balancer v2 pool. This publication favors Option 2 due to the additional capital efficiency of including an LST relative to wETH and noting the majority of the ETH correlated liquidity on Balancer v2 is nominated in wstETH. There is also the potential upside of BAL rewards which is significant given the current Aave roadmap considerations.\n\nIf the Aave community is to pursue this pool, Llama will proceed to seek support within the Balancer, Aura and other communities to determine if Aave would be eligible to participate in the 80/20 incentive program. The wstETH component, plus swap fees, would help reach the revenue contribution requirement of the pool. Whilst the time-lock on the Safety Module is only [3 weeks](https://governance.aave.com/t/bgd-aave-safety-module-v1-5/12148), it will contribute towards the 16 week time lock requirement mentioned in the proposal, [linked here](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-146-incentivize-8020-bpt-staking-ve8020/4210).\n\nGiven the AAVE/wETH pool currently holds [$117M](https://pools.balancer.exchange/#/pool/0xc697051d1c6296c24ae3bcef39aca743861d9a81/) of liquidity, migrating 100% of the pool would nearly meet the top tier TVL requirement ($140M with $7/BAL). With 20% of the pool held in wstETH, yielding 4.5%, this is equivalent to $1.05M in wstETH nominated yield. If Balancer was to receive 50% of this wstETH yield as revenue, then Aave could receive the maximum 250K BAL, provided other conditions are met over the lifetime of the program. For full details do read this [forum post](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-146-incentivize-8020-bpt-staking-ve8020/4210) and an [amendment](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-225-amendment-to-bip-146-incentivize-8020-bpt-staking-ve8020/4543) to the original proposal.\n\nThe migration will require users to activate the cooldown, unstake the BPT v1, withdraw the liquidity, deposit on the new pool and restake.\n\nThis can be implemented independently from the following parts. In this case, a “classic” gauge will be required. Alternatively, the gauge design will be discussed in Part III.\n\n# Technical Specifications:\n\n* Migrate the SM Infrastructure to Balancer V2 (BGD)\n* Create the new pool depending on vote results (Balancer / Llama)\n* Add support of the new pool in the SM (BGD)\n\n# Voting options\n\n1.

        "body": "- - -\n\ntitle: [ARFC] Deploy aCRV & CRV to veCRV\nauthor: @llamaxyz - TokenLogic & @Dydymoon \ndate: 2023.02.09\n\n- - -\n\n# Simple Summary\n\nThis proposal presents Aave with thr options for managing the CRV holding, with @Llamaxyz recommending to lock the CRV for veCRV via Curve Finance.\n\n# Abstract\n\nAave currently holds approximately 696k CRV across Ethereum and Polygon networks. Llama has been looking at potential sources for CRV yield and governance influence. This proposal presents one high yield and one governance focused strategy for consideration:\n\nOption 1) veCRV - Lowest risk, governance and direct control CRV emissions\nOption 2) st-yCRV - High yield, no CRV emission influence and exit liquidity risk\nOption 3 ) sdCRV - High yield, proportional CRV emission influence and exit liquidity risk\n\nTo vote NAE is to deposit CRV in Aave v3 on the network it was earned. This represents the “do nothing” approach.\n\nA Snapshot vote presenting the three options will determine which options will be presented as an AIP. Each option has varying degrees of complexity to implement, with Option 1) being the most difficult in a decentralized way, but more closely aligned with Aave’s GHO and staked aToken direction.\n\n# Motivation\n\nAave currently holds 696k of CRV across Ethereum and Polygon networks. \n\nTo support Aave in choosing how best to manage the CRV holding, Llama presents three high-level strategies to choose between.\n\n## Option 1) veCRV - Lowest risk, governance and direct control CRV emissions\n\nOption 1) includes locking CRV, participating in Curve Finance governance, and voting to direct incentives to pools of Aave’s choosing. veCRV could be used to boost adoption of GHO, yield on staked aToken reserves, and yield on Protocol Owned Liquidity, to name a few potential use cases.\n\n### Pros\n\n* **Gauge weight power (Influence on CRV weekly emission)**\n\nBy locking it 4 years and relocking periodically to get the max voting power, the DAO would be able to redirect 0.0068 CRV/veCRV on the pools of its choice (Most likely directed to a GHO one) \n\nWith the current emission (reduced every year by 15%) the DAO would control 4,740 CRV of emission per week, representing $234.13K per year obtained without any additional expenses. \n\n* **Protocol fees (Profit sharing in 3CRV Stable pool)**\n\n50% of all protocol fees on Curve are directed to LPs, and the other 50% goes to veCRV holders. The current APR is 3,43% which is representative of the usual economic activity. With regular volumes, the APR is close to 2-5%, but weeks like USDC depeg, the APR was 15%. \nNo extra counterparty risk (No protocol on top of Curve) \n\nUnlike the two other options, the CRV will be locked on Curve directly from the Collector contract. This reduces the risks compared to using protocols on top of Curve which adds an additional layer of smart contract counterparty risks. \n\n* **Easy management of the veCRV position & votes** \n\nRe-locking the veCRV position can be made accessible, via adding a function on the Collector Contract. Llama can then create a bot which automatically calls the function and re-commits the veCRV holding. \nThe veCRV option only requires to lock CRV, no extra token required. \n\nWhen a gauge vote is submitted on Curve, there is no need to revote each week even if the position is increased, unless Aave decides to change the vote. \n\n* **Additional features from holding veCRV** \n\nGovernance Power to participate in the DAO decisions (On-Chain)\n\nveBoost which can be sold or utilized to maximize the rewards on the funds deposited: While we agree that the impact will be minimal at first, the veBoost will grow over time with the veCRV holdings, compared to both other solutions where it is lost. \n\n### Cons\n\n* **4 unlock period with frequent relock to keep the max voting power**\n\nThe goal of this strategy is to always relock to have the maximum voting power, and increase the position over time with the CRV earned. If Aave decides to stop this strategy at a later stage, the same amount of CRV that was locked will be available after 4 years. \n\nLlama can automate the relock periodically to avoid the decay. \n\n* **Complex participation in DAO decisions**\n\nGovernance participation can be challenging with the collector contract because of the important amount of DAO decisions voted, and there is no way to delegate the veCRV governance power. \n\n## Option 2) st-yCRV - High yield, no CRV emission influence and exit liquidity risk\n\nOption 2) focuses on yield, forgoes governance influence (participating in votes), and presents a higher-yielding investment strategy that, over time, will lead to Aave own more CRV relative to Option 1).\n\nThis option does not offer any governance influence which leads to an easier management. \n\nHowever, considering the recent events such as USDC de-peg and Euler hack which impacted many protocols, Llama believes that security should be prioritized and Aave  should proceed with the lowest risk proposal. \n\n### Pros\n\n* **Gauge weight power profits (Influence on CRV weekly emission)** \n\nWhile it’s not possible to directly vote with st-yCRV, Yearn utilizes the voting power to vote for the highest vote incentives on the market, then sells everything for CRV and compounds the strategy overtime. \n\n* **Boosted protocol fees profits (Profit sharing in 3CRV Stable pool)**\n\nYearn utilize its veCRV holdings to boost the distribution of the 3CRV (Currently 1.66x) \nAll 3CRV are collected, sold for CRV and compounded overtime.\n\n* **Temporary MegaBoost in CRV**\n\nAs mentioned earlier in this thread, Yearn decided to distribute 30k CRV/Week for a defined amount of time to maximize the yield. These CRV are also compounded in the strategy. Unless the decision is renewed, this should not be taken into account as the initial incentives should end soon. \n\n* **Easy management of the CRV position**\n\nRequires a deposit & stake to enter the strategy. The yield sources are collected in, or sold for CRV which are automatically compounded in st-yCRV. No further action is required by Aave post-staking yCRV.\n\nTotal current APR: 33%\n\n* **Transferable Asset (yCRV)** \n\nWhen CRV are deposited on Yearn, it is periodically relocked as veCRV, but the protocol mint yCRV at 1:1. These yCRV can be staked for st-yCRV and transferred or sold on the yCRV-CRV pool on Curve. \n\n### Cons\n\nNo direct governance influence** \n\nAll the gauge weight power and 3CRV are sold for CRV, and the governance power and veBoost are kept by Yearn. \n\nExtra counterparty risk (Yearn on top of Curve)** \n\nThis solution adds extra smart contract and counterparty risks as required to trust Yearn as a good manager of the strategy. \n\nHigh risk asset profile (Depeg risk)**\n\nThe yCRV is transferable, but the liquidity remains limited: $8.4M.\n \nWith the current Aave holdings and yCRV liquidity, it would be possible to exchange 680k yCRV with a rate of 0.9936:1. \n\nHowever, any selling pressure on the yCRV could lead to Aave incurring significant slippage when trying to exit the position. \n\n## Option 3) sdCRV - High yield, proportional CRV emission influence and exit liquidity risk\n\nsdCRV was proposed by the Stake DAO team in the comments, and presents as an hybrid solution between maximizing yield and governance influence. However, it requires veSDT holdings or boost delegation to Aave to be considered efficient compared to other solutions. \n\nUntil recently, the voting power on sdCRV was acquired progressively over a 30 day period. Stake DAO mentioned a parameter change related to asdcrv, but we couldn’t find any vote or public announcement about this update. However, even after this period, the voting power of 1 sdCRV was not equal to 1 veCRV if Aave does not lock SDT itself  or receive delegation from veSDT holders. \n\n## Pros\n\n* **Proportional gauge weight power (Influence on CRV weekly emission)**\n\nBy depositing 696k CRV on Stake, it would result in a voting power of 0.61 veCRV vote / sdCRV. With the current emission (reduced every year by 15%) the Aave would control 2,891 CRV of emission per week, representing $142.80K per year obtained without any additional expenses or veSDT boost holdings or delegation. \n\nTo avoid a SDT acquisition and reduced voting power, Marc Zeller from ACI is to delegate all his veSDT voting power (270k) to Aave for one year, as well as relocking & re-delegating every week enabling Aave to retain the provided boost. \n\nOther parties mentioned on the forum said that they consider to delegate, but no one other than ACI confirmed that they will delegate, relock & redelegate frequently or disclosed their holdings to track the delegation, so it’s not taken into account in this recap.  \n\nAccording to AaveChan engagement, the veSDT holding delegation would boost the voting power  to 1.14x for 1 year. \n\nWith the current emission (reduced every year by 15%) the DAO would control 5,403 CRV of emission per week, representing $266.9K per year obtained with 270k veSDT boost delegated. However, as soon as the delegation is over, the voting power will be back to 0.61x. \n\n* **Proportional protocol fees (Profit sharing in 3CRV Stable pool)**\n\nSame as on Curve, the 3CRV fees are distributed to sdCRV stakers. \n\n* **Transferable Asset (sdCRV)** \n\nWhen CRV are deposited on Stake DAO, it is periodically relocked as veCRV, but the protocol mint sdCRV at 1:1. These sdCRV can be staked for sdCRV-gauge, transferred or sold on the sdCRV-CRV pool on Curve. \n\nAdditionally, the Stake DAO team communicated that the votes now operate like veCRV.  Please note, Llama has not been able to publicly find this announcement beyond this forum thread.\n\n## Cons\n\n* **Extra counterparty risk (Stake on top of Curve)**\n\nThis solution adds extra smart contracts risks, similar to st-yCRV with additional counterparty risk through reliance on ACI and/or others to provide delegated veSDT support. This veSDT support requires weekly relock and redelegation to avoid impacting the boost.\n\nAs Aave’s CRV continues to grow in line with Aave revenue, additional veSDT delegation will be required to maintain the maximum boost. Llama does not question ACI’s dedication to Aave. After the initial committed 1 year period, Aave will receive reduced voting power if an alternative veSDT delegate is not found.\n\n* **High risk asset profile (Depeg risk)** \n\nThe sdCRV is transferable, but the liquidity remains limited: $3.8M.\n\n\nWith the current Aave holdings and liquidity, it would be possible to exchange 680k sdCRV with a rate of 0.9826:1.\n\n* **Management of the rewards**\n\nConsidering that Aave will vote for pools with no vote incentives have decided on the Curve pools, Aave would not earn part of the yield disclosed on the UI. \n\n\nMoreover, all rewards from vote incentives are sold for SDT and distributed. If Aave is to accumulate a CRV holding over time, the SDT tokens would need to be swapped to CRV. \n\n* **No veBoost (Kept by Stake DAO)** \n\nSame as Yearn, Stake DAO would keep the veBoost to maximize the yield on their strategies. \n\n## NAE - aCRV on v3 Liquidity Pools\n\nTo vote NAE involves Aave holding all CRV positions in the form of aCRV.\n\nAll CRV is to be migrated/deposited into Aave v3 on the respective network and held as aCRV. In order to achieve this, CRV must first be listed on Aave v3 Ethereum. The only smart contract exposure is the Aave protocol and this strategy best represents the “do nothing” approach versus either optimizing for governance influence with yield, Option 1), or outright CRV yield, Option 2).\n\n## Comments\n\nLlama suggests Option 1) to focus on accumulating active voting power and enabling Aave to determine how to manage the position.\n\nWe are particularly interested in creating an Aave aToken liquidity pool and explore what can be done to support GHO and staked aTokens when more details emerge around those upgrades. In our opinion, Option 2) has several significant unknowns which can impact the success of the strategy.\n\n# Next Steps\n\nThe proposal with the most YAE votes will be presented as an AIP  for voting. \n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",
