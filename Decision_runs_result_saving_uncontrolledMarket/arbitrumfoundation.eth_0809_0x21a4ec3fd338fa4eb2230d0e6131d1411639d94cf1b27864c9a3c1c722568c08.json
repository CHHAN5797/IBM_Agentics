    "ai_final_reason": "• The timeline analysis indicates a unanimous and stable lead for the 'For' option throughout the voting period, showing strong and consistent support.\n• Forum sentiment analysis reveals a majority positive sentiment with 24 positive, 19 negative, and 47 neutral comments; initial comments showed both nuanced support and constructive concerns, but overall positive engagement dominates.\n• The proposal aligns with community interest in improving strategic collaboration and governance efficiency, with many delegates emphasizing the value of in-person or hybrid formats while acknowledging cost concerns.\n• Similar past proposals focused on expanding DAO capabilities have mixed market impacts but no clear failures, suggesting the exploratory nature of this proposal poses low risk and potential upside.\n• Although some forum voices expressed reservations about online formats and costs, the recommendation to 'For' matches aggregated community sentiment and vote momentum, supporting a move to explore the off-site event concept.\n• The decision to 'Change' reflects the belief that this initiative will provide long-term value by enhancing DAO coordination and delegate collaboration, outweighing concerns about execution details that can be refined post-exploration.",
