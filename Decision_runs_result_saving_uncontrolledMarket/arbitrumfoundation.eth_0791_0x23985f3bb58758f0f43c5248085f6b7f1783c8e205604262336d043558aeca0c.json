To address this, a pilot fund is proposed, utilizing Questbook's small grants model to support early-stage initiatives focused on problem definition (root causes, gathering requirements), alignment, and scoping proposals for operational and governance improvements. A problem gathering exercise will be conducted to inform proposers and the assessor by identifying key problem areas through user research interviews, qualitative surveys of delegates and other stakeholders, and a collective intelligence algorithm, clustering initiatives to ensure alignment between proposals and the DAO's current needs.\nThe pilot fund will prioritize initiatives aiming to improve ArbiturmDAO's operations and governance. An assessor, elected by the DAO, will oversee the proposal assessment, following the established Questbook program rules. The success of this pilot will be measured by the number of initiatives that receive subsequent funding, clarity and alignment generated within the community, and an over 80% approval rate in a Snapshot vote to continue the program.\n\n\n# The Problem:\n\n\nThe DAO has multiple challenges but currently needs a way to fund the initial steps of addressing them. As a result, only groups with a lot to win will invest all the necessary time and effort and take the risk to evolve a proposal without being paid.\n\n\nAreas like organisation design, strategy, spending plan, and more require not just crafting a proposal but they require problem definition work: significant stakeholder engagement to determine the right approach, understand root causes and requirements, generate buy-in, and craft the right proposal to make. There’s currently no way to fund all this problem definition and preparatory work leading to the DAO advancing slowly, delegates being overwhelmed assessing proposals that don’t quite hit the mark, and meanwhile key decisions and needed proposals don’t happen.\n\n\n# Proposed Solution:\n\n\n1. A method for the DAO to aggregate challenge statements or problems\n2. A funding program for initiatives that will carry out problem definition and initial solution work on one of the challenge statements.\n\n\nQuestbook has shown to be a viable mechanism for distributing small grants to groups. We propose to use this model and set up a pilot fund to evolve proposals that address key Operational and Governance needs to improve Arbiturm DAO.\n\n\nAdditionally, we’ll carry out a “collective intelligence exercise” to identify the key problem areas.\nAnd we're including an option in the Snapshot to also fund a Playbook for Proposing to the DAO, where we'll gather the learnings of the grantees who successfully pass a proposal through the DAO and the challenges of those who didn't, and document them as material for future grantees.\n\n\n**What will be funded via the Jumpstart Fund:**\n\n\n* Early-stage initiatives aiming to improve ArbiturmDAO ops and gov\n* Priority for funding initiatives advancing problem definition and alignment around key challenges.\n* Requirement for being referred by at least 3 of the top 30 delegates.\n* Priority for proposals including a last milestone for a successful snapshot vote (i.e. success bonus of at least 10%).\n* Initiatives expected to last up to 3 months.\n* Initiatives can request up to USD$50k equivalent (subsequent submissions considered).\n* product/protocol development will not be funded (that’s better suited for other Questbook tracks or programs).\n\n\n**How are proposals assessed:**\n\n\n* An assessor will be selected by the DAO via an election as conducted for previous Questbook tracks.\n* Proposals up to USD $25k can be approved directly by the assessor for this track. Proposals above this amount requires cross-checking with the assessors form other tracks.\n\n\n**Fund governance:**\n\n\nThis track will follow the same rules as the ongoing Questbook program ([link](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/questbook-dda-program-phase-2-request-for-continuation/21326)), whereby funds are held in the multisig operated by the assessors of the multiple Questbook tracks.\nThe totality of the funds are to be transferred there and the signers will provide payment for the service provision parts upon completion (e.g. problem assessment, playbook if completed, etc).\n\n\n**Method to Identify Problem Areas:**\n\n\nBefore opening the fund to proposals, we’ll work with the DAO to identify key problem areas that could then lead to proposals for problem definition and alignment work. This work will be carried by RnDAO's research team.\n\n\nBased on Professor Daniel Kahneman’s work, we have selected a collective intelligence method that provides high efficiency (low time involvement required from delegates) and is credibly neutral. The method is based on the use of a qualitative survey of delegates and other stakeholders to collect a list of statements proposing key challenges. We'll complement this mechanism with user research interviews with the top 30 delegates.\nThe statements are then analysed using a collective intelligence algorithm (SimScore) that identifies a theoretical ‘central’ statement that would be most agreed upon, and then analyses the provided statements to rank them for proximity to said theoretical centre.\n\n\nThe ranked statements, as well as the graph (positioning of statements relative to each other), will then be made publicly available to inform (not mandate, just inform) those proposing initiatives to the pilot fund.\n\n\n(Further untangling between statements and root cause analysis is part of the work this Questbook track will fund.)\n\n\n# Timeline:\n\n\nThe Pilot is expected to last 4-6 months depending on whether the option to distil learnings into a playbook for proposing to the DAO is approved in Snapshot or not.\n\n\n* Month 1 for identifying problem areas.\n* Month 2-4 for assessing and funding proposals.\n* Month 5 for reporting\n* month 6 for (optional) collecting learnings about proposal development into playbook\n\n\n# What does success look like?\n\n\n* Experts in the community can work towards improving Arbiturm DAO.\n* The initiatives funded generate clarity, buy-in, and alignment,\n* The initiatives funded evolve towards full proposals for the DAO and are funded.\n* The delegates love this pilot and want to continue funding it.\n\n\n**KPIs:**\n\n\n* 40%+ of initiatives continued and received subsequent funding\n* Over 80% approval in a Snapshot vote asking delegates whether the program should be continued after the pilot\n\n\n# Budget \n![Screenshot 2024-07-15 at 4.57.04 PM.png](ipfs://bafkreigovxyqq2et74lbej5yjjpwfdt4wgxdg5mz4rcvhjpk75owswl62a)",

        "body": "[Non-Constitutional] \n\n**TL;DR**\n\nWhat this proposal does:\n\n* Give Arbitrum DAO more options for doing grants in stablecoins, making long term investments using stablecoins, and having safer access to capital without needing to sell treasury assets like ARB tokens.\n* Design and build a system for borrowing stablecoins that prevents liquidations via more assets being pulled from the treasury to increase collateralization.\n* Release that Treasury Backed Vault system publicly as a public good which can be used on any stablecoin protocol.\n* Complete a security audit on the smart contact code for the TBV, and a thorough risk assessment.\n* Report the findings and parameter recommendations to the DAO.\n\nWhat this proposal does **NOT** do:\n\n* Give allowances to move ARB from the treasury to any CDP protocol.\n* Create debt or other positions with DAO funds.\n\n# Abstract \n\nThis pilot stage proposal seeks to complete Research & Development, as well as a comprehensive risk analysis, on a new Treasury Backed Vault (TBV) system which gives Arbitrum DAO the option to borrow stablecoins from existing protocols against ARB, with extremely reduced liquidation risk. It expands on existing discussions/designs of “DAO Owned Liquidations” for CDP protocols. Liquidations are always prevented by automatically pulling more collateral from the DAO treasury, increasing the collateral ratio of the loan.\n\n### Pilot Phase\n\nThis pilot is designed to give the DAO sufficient information to make an informed decision regarding borrowing stablecoins against assets in the treasury, and the confidence to use our proposed solution safely.\n\n# Motivation\n\nThe Arbitrum community is seeking ways to more efficiently and effectively use the capital in the treasury. The strategies for grant programs, Mergers and Acquisitions, long term investments, and treasury sustainability seek sustainable solutions that minimize required sell pressure on the ARB token.\n\nThe treasury currently has about $3.8B USD worth of ARB tokens. Long term diversification of this is key, but the community also needs access to capital now for grants, treasury management, M&A, and more. Developing an alternative strategy for accessing stablecoins gives Arbitrum DAO more options and power.\n\n# Key Terms\n\nCDP - Collateralized Debt Position. A type of financial primitive used by protocol like Maker, Open Dollar, Reflexer, etc.. Collateral backs stablecoins with required loan to value ratios.\n\nLiquidation - an event which happens when the value of collateral backing a loan is less than the value of the loan, or below a required threshold. This forces the collateral to be sold in order to pay back the debt.\n\n# Specifications\n\nThe DAO should have the option to borrow stablecoins against its ARB and other future assets. However, using traditionally structured lending protocols creates too much risk of liquidation. Our proposed solution is a Treasury Backed Vault that severely limits the liquidation risks and lets the community achieve its goals with open access to its capital.\n\nLiquidations are mitigated by a “savior module” connected to a CDP position. The savior module adds an additional step between a vault being marked for liquidation and becoming liquidated. The module automatically pulls more ARB tokens directly from the DAO treasury (or elsewhere), adds them to the collateral of the position until it is raised above the liquidation threshold, and completely prevents liquidations from occurring. Any time liquidation on the DAO’s position is called, the savior activates first. The module contract would be given an allowance of ARB tokens by the Treasury to spend, allowing the Arbitrum DAO to completely control and at any time update the bounds of how many tokens can be pulled from the treasury.\n\nExample usage of Treasury Backed Vaults:\n\n1. Arbitrum DAO deposits 1,000,000 ARB, worth $1,500,000 in a CDP protocol like Open Dollar or others where Treasury Backed Vaults are enabled.\n2. Arbitrum DAO gives a TBV savior module permission to spend an additional 1,000,000 ARB, which remains in the DAO treasury. The DAO sets parameters with the savior.\n3. Arbitrum DAO borrows 1,000,000 stablecoins worth $1,000,000\n4. Due to market conditions, the price of ARB drops 33% suddenly, and the position is under the required collateralization ratio. It is now up for liquidation.\n5. Anyone calls the public function to liquidate the position. The vault is marked for liquidation.\n6. Before liquidation occurs, the savior module is automatically called. It has been set with specific parameters by the DAO to pull an additional 1,000,000 ARB from the treasury and deposit it in the vault.\n7. The position now has 2,000,000 ARB deposited in it, and is safely over the collateralization requirements. No liquidation happens and no additional votes were required to manage the position safely.\n\n# Steps to Implement\n\nThe implementation is essentially split into 4 phases\n\n1. Research and Development\n\nA team of 3 solidity developers design, build, and document Treasury Backed Vaults with support for Arbitrum DAO specifically in mind.\n\n2. Risk Analysis\n\nA team of 2 financial analysts complete a report on suggested parameters and the greater ecosystem impact of different borrowing scenarios for Arbitrum DAO. This will come with many helpful recommendations that future delegates can lean on to make proposals to use the vaults how they choose.\n\n3. Audit\n\nA public audit contest will be conducted and managed by our team to review the security of the smart contracts of the TBV. This is important to complete at this stage because we want the DAO to be able to feel confident in the readiness of the system. A formal security report will be published and summarized in a post to the DAO. Audit reward recipients will be required to complete compliance and KYC before receiving funds.\n\n4. Reporting\n\nAt the end of the pilot a report will be made to the DAO that includes results of the security audit, documentation on using TBVs, and results of the risk analysis. The report will include recommendations like how much ARB should be allowed to be pulled by a TBV to limit risk, how many stablecoins could safely be borrowed at a time if the DAO should choose to use the TBVs, how much sell pressure on ARB could be avoided in different scenarios, suggested collateralization settings, and other parameters for real usage.\n\n# Timeline\n\nOverall time to project completion: ~2.5 months\n\nResearch and Development, done asynchronous with risk analysis reporting: 1.5 months\n\nSecurity audit and reporting: 2 weeks\n\nComplete report for the DAO and documentation on usage: 2 weeks\n\n# Team\n\nResearch and development will be completed by a designated team made up on contributors to Open Dollar and led specifically by [CupOjoseph](https://github.com/cupojoseph) & [Pi0neerpat](https://github.com/pi0neerpat). Open Dollar is the largest Arbitrum native stablecoin protocol by TVL. We will also oversee the third party audit of the code that is developed, and personally present the risk analysis (including recommendations) to the DAO at the end of the pilot.\n\n# Overall Cost -\nTotal cost: **250,000 ARB**\n\n### Breakdown\nResearch and Development: 125,000 ARB\n\nIndependent Security Audit: 50,000 ARB\n\nRisk Analysis Report: 50,000 ARB\n\nAdministrative: 25,000 ARB\n\nRemaining or unspent funds will be returned to the DAO treasury promptly.\n\nThank you!! Please support our proposal, we think this could be a huge unlock for the DAO and a powerful tool to add to the community’s toolbox. We appreciate any further feedback on and off the forum on this proposal and the Treasury Backed Vaults concept overall.\n\n## Helpful links:\n\n[Treasury Backed Vaults Overview from Open Dollar](https://www.opendollar.com/treasury-backed-vaults)\n\n[Original DAO Owned Liquidations post](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/dao-owned-liquidations-using-collaterized-debt-positions/21109/2)\n\n[Arbitrum Treasury Sustainability Group discussion on DAO Owned Liquidations](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrum-treasury-and-sustainability-working-group/18978)\n\n[Existing proof of concept implementation](https://github.com/open-dollar/treasury-backed-vault-savior). That's right, we already started building. :sunglasses:\n\nEDIT:\nBased on the feedback so far we will publish this week a list of specific research and modeling questions that should be answered in the risk analysis report.\n\n## Risk Analysis Report Topics\nA list of topics, as requested by the community, that will be covered in the report. Each will have a model of different scenarios and specific recommendations to take on short, medium, and long term time horizons.\n\n- Over-Collateralization Ratio requirements for loans are different sizes\n- Interest rate settings for loans are different sizes\n- Loan sizes based on different market conditions (including worst case scenario)\n- Propose Debt ceiling requirements on CDP protocols that integrate TBV\n- Sell pressure situations on the stablecoin\n- Strategies for paying down debt long term given different market situations\n- Percentage of the stablecoin which is backed by TBV or ARB token versus baskets of other assets\n- Outline Mechanism for reporting on the health of TBV positions",

        "body": "## Constitutional / Non-Constitutional\n\nNon-Constitutional\n\n## Abstract\n\nTally has contributed to the Arbitrum DAO as a service provider since the DAO was created one year ago, serving as the home for [onchain governance](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum), [security council elections](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/council/security-council/election/0/round-2), and [delegation](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/delegates). We’ve gathered feedback about how we can improve our support for Arbitrum through many conversations over the past year with DAO stakeholders including delegates, contributors, and Foundation representatives. We propose to expand our support for the Arbitrum DAO by improving the proposal process, upgrading the Governor contracts, and highlighting delegate contributions. We also propose to ensure that the DAO is set up for success by researching specifications for partial delegation and shielded voting.\n\n## Motivation\n\nArbitrum is the largest and most decentralized DAO in the world. Tally is highly invested in the success of both the Arbitrum DAO specifically and the Arbitrum community as a whole. We have a strong track record as an Arbitrum governance service provider, [ecosystem builder](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/tally-final-stip-round-1/17557), and [delegate](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/delegate/0xfrisson.eth). Tally continuously ships improvements for the Arbitrum DAO, including [transfer actions](https://x.com/tallyxyz/status/1732425795262714363?s=20), [improved Safe support](https://x.com/tallyxyz/status/1714647532423561257?s=20), [proposal collaboration](https://x.com/tallyxyz/status/1743325532786168149?s=20), and the [nominee selection stage](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-changes-to-the-constitution-and-the-security-council-election-process/20856/9?u=frisson) of Security Council elections. This proposal would enable us to invest more resources into the Arbitrum DAO and scale up our impact.\n\nThe majority of the improvements outlined in this proposal are specific to Arbitrum's unique implementation of onchain governance and will not be re-used in other DAOs. We are long-term partners to the Arbitrum DAO who plan to continue investing specifically in making Arbitrum governance great. \n\n## Rationale\n\nThis proposal contributes to Arbitrum [Community Values](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/dao-constitution#section-6-community-values) by making the Arbitrum DAO more socially inclusive, technically inclusive, and user-focused. Our proposed improvements make it easier for contributors of all backgrounds and technical abilities to engage with Arbitrum governance.\n\n## Specifications and Steps to Implement\n\nWe propose to expand our support for the Arbitrum DAO by improving the proposal process, upgrading the Governor contracts, and highlighting delegate contributions. We also propose to ensure that the DAO is set up for success by developing a specification for partial delegation and shielded voting.\n\n**Improve the proposal process** \n*Watch a demo video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yORl1yZPt7Q) - note that this demo is designed to provide a general overview of the user experience. It is not a final design.*\n\n* Link forum proposal posts and Tally proposals so that delegates can create Tally proposals from forum posts, see forum proposal comments directly on Tally, and be updated by a Tally Discourse bot when onchain proposals are created.\n  * In order to show posts on the proposal page, Tally would need [Embedding permission](https://meta.discourse.org/t/embed-discourse-comments-on-another-website-via-javascript/31963)\n  * In order to post \"this proposal is now onchain (link)\", the Tally Discourse bot would need an API key with topics.writepermission from https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/admin/api/keys/new\n* Build a diff checker into Tally proposals that shows what text has changed from Snapshot without having to click back over to Snapshot, to help delegates understand any relevant changes from the temp check phase to the onchain governance phase.\n* Enable cancel functionality on Tally proposals so proposal creators can cancel onchain proposals if there are mistakes. (see upgrade Governor contracts section)\n* Develop full proposal execution integration by dynamically showing [each phase of proposal execution](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/concepts/lifecycle-anatomy-aip-proposal#the-lifecycle-of-an-arbitrum-improvement-proposal) with accurate time stamps so that contributors and delegates can easily manage proposals through the execution process.\n* Improve support for [late quorum extension](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/dao-glossary#late-quorum-extension) on Tally so onchain proposals are automatically extended on Tally when late quorum extension is triggered.\n* Fully integrate the [quorum of each Governor](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/dao-faqs#what-determines-the-quorum-minimum-votes-required-for-a-governance-proposal) throughout Tally, including on the proposal page and the delegates page so that delegates always know exactly how much voting power is required to reach quorum.\n* Show [Security Council](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/concepts/security-council#the-role-of-the-security-council) transactions on the main [Arbitrum DAO page](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum) on Tally so the DAO can easily view actions taken by the Security Council.\n\n**Upgrade Governor contracts**\n*We’re planning to partner with [Scopelift](https://scopelift.co/) to implement the upgrades. Scopelift is the developer of Flexible Voting and has deep experience with high-value governance contract upgrades.*\n\n* Add a [cancel() function](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/92ff025622cdf6694318fc11af1c995236793a77/contracts/governance/Governor.sol#L455-L473) to the Arbitrum DAO’s implementation of OpenZeppelin Governor so proposal creators can cancel onchain proposals if there are mistakes.\n* Add [Flexible Voting](https://github.com/ScopeLift/flexible-voting) to the Arbitrum DAO Governors to enable future innovations like voting from Orbit chains, voting from DeFi contracts, and shielded voting.\n\n**Highlight delegate contributions**\n*Watch a demo video [here](https://youtube.com/watch?v=WY1jQ2tP70U) - note that this demo is designed to provide a general overview of the user experience. It is not a final design.*\n\n* Integrate [Karma’s](https://www.karmahq.xyz/) delegate score and contributor metrics into Tally’s delegate page so token holders and DAO stakeholders have access to holistic participation information. Karma will provide the following via their API:\n  * Onchain and Snapshot voting pct, delegator count, voting power, list of delegators\n  * Stats for different timeframes: Lifetime, last 30 days, last 90 days etc\n  * Various sorting criteria (score, voting power, voting pct, forum activity)\n  * Onchain endorsements by peer delegates\n  * Updates to the scoring logic if needed (Based on community feedback)\n  * Software maintenance and keeping data updated on daily basis\n\n**Research to set the DAO up for long-term success**\n\n* Research a partial delegation solution so that token holders can delegate to more than one address.\n* Research a solution for shielded onchain voting so that large delegate voting does not influence other voters during the voting or election period. Ensure that this solution applies to Security Council elections.\n\n## Timeline\n\nResearch and Design: 0.5 months\n\nDevelopment: 2 months\n\nTesting, audit, and deployment (includes DAO proposal): 2 months\n\n**Total:** 4.5 months\n\n## Overall Cost\n\nImprove the proposal process: $120,000 USD in ARB\n\nUpgrade Governor contracts: $50,000 USD in ARB (100% will go to Scopelift)\n\nHighlight delegate contributions: $40,000 USD in ARB\n\n* Tally: $20,000 USD in ARB\n* Karma: $20,000 USD in ARB\n\nResearch to set the DAO up for long-term success: $10,000 USD in ARB\n\n**Total:** $220,000 USD in ARB\n\n*special thanks to the DAO Ops Excellence team at GovHack who helped moved this proposal forward @shawn16400 @hiringdevs.eth @hung-vu @cbxm*",

        "author": "0xB933AEe47C438f22DE0747D57fc239FE37878Dd1",
        "body": "# Abstract\n\nThis proposal seeks a 12 weeks extension (until November 30\\) of the Pyth Network’s [previously approved LTIPP grant](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/pyth-network-ltipp-application-draft/22003).\n\nInitially, the Pyth Network was allocated 1,000,000 ARB through the LTIPP process. To date, we have utilized approximately 75,042 ARB over the 12-week duration of the program.\n\nWe are requesting to retain 174,958 ARB, bringing our total expenditure to 250,000 ARB out of the original 1,000,000, until the new grant programs are established.\n\n# Motivation\n\nWe want to highlight that incentives for infrastructure protocols and public goods, such as the Pyth oracle, typically do not yield immediate results. The impact from making such incentives available to DeFi often unfolds over weeks or even months.\n\nFor existing DeFi applications, switching to a new oracle involves significant effort and may require a new audit. Similarly, expanding from other chains to Arbitrum can be more time-consuming than anticipated, as illustrated by the Synthetix case [here](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/synthetix-ltipp-application-final/22023/20).\n\nThanks to the initial LTIPP program, Arbitrum dApps had the ability to build robust oracle systems covering over 500 assets, including cryptocurrencies, FX, stocks, ETFs, and commodities. This advancement has eliminated outdated on-chain price updates and high costs, reinforcing Arbitrum’s position as a premier layer for DeFi. This progress empowers developers to create cutting-edge applications without constraints. This extension aims to keep the momentum and further empower potential new entrants like Synthetix to deliver a best-in-class protocol.\n\n# Rationale\n\nThe proposed extension of the Pyth Network’s LTIPP grant is designed to further cultivate a thriving and innovative DeFi ecosystem on Arbitrum. The LTIPP program has already proven its effectiveness, with Pyth price updates on-chain increasing by 2-3 times and peaking at nearly 10 times the previous levels, reaching over 70,000 updates on July 14\\.\n\nBefore the program began, the total value secured by the Pyth oracle on Arbitrum was just over 43,000 ETH. This figure has since risen to 52,500 ETH, reflecting an increase of more than 20%.\n\nPyth has also enabled over $16.1 billion in trading volume on various Arbitrum decentralized perpetual exchanges during June and July (with August data pending). This underscores the benefits for applications powered by Pyth Network: protocols using Pyth have experienced, including increased total value locked (TVL), higher trading volumes, and more frequent price updates driven by a growing number of applications utilizing Pyth.\n\nThe request for a 12-week extension, with a reduced ARB allocation, is part of our commitment towards responsible resource management commitment to responsible resource management while continuing to support the long-term success of applications built on Arbitrum that leverage Pyth. By covering the gas costs for using the Pyth oracle, the network has enabled more developers to create robust DeFi applications without the burden of high operational expenses.\n\nThis strategy strengthens Arbitrum’s position as a premier platform for DeFi innovation, where developers can access over 500 price feeds without financial or technical constraints.\n\nIt’s important to understand that the impact of incentives for infastructure protocols and public goods like the Pyth price oracle are not immediate: it often takes weeks or even months to materialize.\n\nFurthermore, it’s important to recognize that the impact of incentives for infrastructure protocols and public goods like the Pyth oracle is not immediate; it often takes weeks or even months to materialize.\n\nThis proposal, aims to build on the momentum generated by the initial LTIPP program, ensuring the continued growth and expansion of the Arbitrum ecosystem as new grant strategies are developed and implemented.\n\n# Key Terms\n\n* On-demand or pull oracle: An oracle network where anyone can permissionlessly trigger price updates on-chain by doing an Arbitrum tx\n\n# Specifications\n\n* 13 weeks duration  \n* 175,000 ARB\n\nThe proposed extension duration is similar to that of the previous LTIPP program—12 weeks versus 13 weeks (including retroactive rebates for the end of August). However, the amount of ARB tokens requested for gas rebates has increased from 75,000 ARB to 175,000 ARB.\n\nThis increase reflects an anticipated rise in activity and associated costs, estimated at approximately 133%. The launch of Synthetix’s Multi-Collateral Perps on Arbitrum is expected to drive a substantial increase in the number of price updates triggered on-chain. For context, Synthetix currently triggers around 1,000 daily updates on Optimism and between 3,000 and 5,000 daily updates on Base—both without additional incentives in place.\n\n# Steps to Implement\n\nIf the Arbitrum DAO approves this extension, no additional work or involvement will be required from the DAO itself. The responsibility for managing the funds and continuing the program would remain entirely with the Pyth Data Association.\n\nAs during the initial 12 weeks of the LTIPP, the Pyth Data Association would continue reimbursing dApps for gas costs every two weeks. Additionally, we would maintain our practice of providing bi-weekly updates on the Arbitrum forum to ensure transparency and accountability. Our latest report is available [here](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/pyth-network-bi-weekly-update-26-august-2024/26525), and we are open to including even more detailed data and information in these reports if needed.\n\nSince this is an extension of an already approved grant, no additional legal work is necessary. The Pyth Data Association has already completed KYC and signed the grant agreement with the Arbitrum Foundation.\n\n# Timeline\n\nThe LTIPP program officially ended on August 26, and until this extension proposal is approved, the Pyth Data Association has paused reimbursing the gas costs incurred by dApps during this period.\n\nIf approved, the extension would be applied retroactively, starting from the end of the LTIPP program on August 26. This means that, depending on the timing of the Snapshot vote, there could be up to 2-3 weeks of retroactive gas rebates.\n\nThe proposed extension would conclude on November 30, 2024.\n\n# Overall Cost\n\nThe cost to the Arbitrum DAO can be seen as an opportunity cost of 174,958 ARB, or potentially even less. Originally, the DAO approved a grant of 1,000,000 ARB—funds that were effectively budgeted and allocated—of which only 75,042 ARB was utilized during the 12-week LTIPP period.\n\nWe are now requesting to retain 174,958 ARB from the initial allocation to continue offsetting costs for DeFi applications that use Pyth’s on-demand price feeds. The remaining 750,000 ARB will be returned to the Arbitrum DAO as previously agreed under the LTIPP program. Furthermore, if any funds remain unspent before the outlined timeline concludes, Pyth Data Association will promptly return those ARB tokens to the DAO.\n\n# Additional Context\n\nWe have been actively seeking feedback and advice from [@Matt_StableLab](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/matt_stablelab) to determine the best approach for moving forward with this extension request.\n\nOur interest in extending the LTIPP grant was initiated in the original LTIPP discussion [here](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/pyth-network-ltipp-application-draft/22003/10).\n\nCurrently, we plan to submit this extension request on Snapshot by Thursday, September 5, with support from Wintermute. This timeline allows ample opportunity to gather feedback on the proposal and make any necessary adjustments based on input from the DAO.\n\nPlease note that Wintermute will merely be sponsoring the proposal as a delegate which is separate from their role as an LTIPP Council member.",

        "body": "### Abstract\n\nWe propose that the Arbitrum DAO takes control of its data by publishing a daoURI onchain. The daoURI, following EIP-4824, will create a single source of truth on the DAO, that cannot be altered by external agencies, is fully manageable via governance, bringing helpful context on the DAO onchain. This will be helpful for newcomers, tooling providers, and experienced governooors alike.\n\nDAOstar received a grant from the Arbitrum Foundation to improve the adoption of EIP-4824 in the Arbitrum ecosystem. We are allocating a portion of that grant to steward this proposal. **Adopting EIP-4824 requires no additional spend from the DAO treasury, and it makes no change to its smart contracts or governance structure.**\n\n### Motivation\n\nThe Arbitrum DAO is one of the largest DAOs, and there is a lot of data surrounding it. This dataset grows with every new initiative and has multiple components that may not be very visible from the “outside”. For example, consider the following questions:\n\n1. Who are the current Security Council, Arbitrum Research & Development Collective, Procurement Committee members? (Answer: you can search the respective forum post to find this)\n2. Can you share a location that tracks all DAO-owned/managed multisig addresses? (Answer: this could be https://www.arbwallets.xyz/)\n3. Can you share a status update on the DAO’s grant spending? (Answer: R3gen Finance reports this on the forum)\n4. Where can we see delegate performance? (Answer: KarmaGAP or Tally)\n5. How much in sequencer fees is being collected? (Answer: there is a dashboard for this)\n6. What orbit chains exist? (Answer: the ecosystem page tracks this)\n7. Where to find recordings and transcripts of public meetings? (Answer: I’m not sure!)\n\nFor an active participant, these answers might not be very hard. But for the majority of people who are not active participants of the DAO, and even for tooling providers, collecting this information requires a painstaking amount of manual effort. This leads to inconsistencies, errors and outdated information.\n\nThere are over 200 DAOs at the moment with a treasury size of over $1M, and collecting information on them manually is becoming an exponentially difficult task. EIP-4824 was authored by DAOstar with the support from the Ethereum Foundation, Gnosis, Etherscan, DeepDAO, Snapshot, and a large number of DAO tooling companies, to create a better infrastructure for DAO data.\n\nAdopting EIP-4824 essentially means that the DAO publishes a daoURI onchain. daoURIs have a standard JSON-LD format:\n\n\n```\n{\n\"@context\": \"http://www.daostar.org/schemas\",\n\"type\": \"DAO\",\n\"name\": \"<name of the DAO>\",\n\"description\": \"<description>\",\n\"membersURI\": \"<URI>\",\n\"proposalsURI\": \"<URI>\",\n\"activityLogURI\": \"<URI>\",\n\"governanceURI\": \"<URI>\",\n\"contractsRegistryURI\": \"<URI>\"\n}\n```\n\nIt contains information on governance, members, activities and contracts by default. Outside of the endpoints mentioned above, a DAO can also choose to publish information that is specifically important to it. For Arbitrum, this could be information about orbit chains, different multi-sigs and councils, spending, sequencer fees, link to its constitution, etc. Essentially, **the daoURI creates an “official repository” of information on the DAO.**\n\nHere are some examples of how the daoURI could be used:\n\n1. It can be used to bring more context to contracts on block explorers. For example, we could go from this:\n\n \n![image](ipfs://bafybeigtmvyem5lo4vuyy33bac4cqqxd54qejrk5popmitan546oicaxey)\n    \nto this:\n\n![image](ipfs://bafybeiacscrrfv5itmx7b53ckjju4qatmldxksobzwdm7eg7xbovm7dhx4)\n    \n2. We can make DAO data easily and freely available to everyone\n\nFor example, Arbitrum DAO’s current DeepDAO profile misses a ton of info - contracts, or revenue, or governance guardrails (councils and multi-sigs), etc. Messari’s Arbitrum DAO dashboard requires a paid membership to access, which could also be due to the difficulty of collecting and presenting DAO data (thus making it too valuable to give away for free). By making access to this information easy, we can greatly improve the DAO’s transparency. i.e, go from: \n\n![image](ipfs://bafybeicfctlylbtxcwbb3rwms4ncpu7ndnlc5lzbuojyeb3hk66xmzwdci)\n    \nto this:\n\n \n![image](ipfs://bafybeihgmwshgkkfsnvhlc2ukbzcdpj3dj6hrhx3wmke33zl3kwn5pidvu)\n    \n\n3. daoURI makes it much easier to structure metadata improvements.\n\nA specific example that surfaced during Arbitrum GovHack (*thanks to Paulo Fonseca)*: onchain proposals at Arbitrum DAO (or any DAO for that matter) do not reference a forum discussion. This takes away a lot of available information. If we wanted to change this, we could achieve it easily by enforcing a discussionURI field inside the proposalURI (which is a standard component of daoURI). Tally, Aragon, Snapshot X, and most governance tooling providers are members of DAOstar. Extending the standard will create an easy upgrade pathway for them and this change would reflect the change across the ecosystem.\n\nTo summarize, a daoURI creates a source of truth for metadata, that can represent the present state of the DAO, and is easily accessible for onchain and offchain tools. This proposal carries no additional cost, or changes to any existing smart contract or process. It's a step in the right direction with no downside.\n\n### Specifications\n\nExecution is a simple contract call to the EIP-4824 Registration Factory which deploys a new registration contract that’ll store the daoURI. The registration will be on Arbitrum One network, setting the DAO’s Governor timelock as admin, and managers as the DAO decides.\n\nA DAO that runs the same configuration as Arbitrum DAO and has adopted EIP-4824 is Unlock Protocol. We are adding that transaction here for [reference](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/unlock/proposal/88514909609252335816460489315313822288366112768901791852399180053604763902892), along with successful proposals at [Treasure](https://snapshot.org/#/treasuregaming.eth/proposal/0x957349f6d60f07e95d6e426536996af96ca63f0b9e0495ee8e73554207cb2381) and [1inch](https://snapshot.org/#/1inch.eth/proposal/0xc25a02d6520fd69ae98ef10b72f3024db2e710d00d51fbc7c03581710e0b8b7b) that were executed through their respective treasury safes.\n\n### Timeline\n\nCreation of daoURI V0.1 (includes conversations with delegates, service providers, the Arbitrum Foundation, and all other participants through the forum, led by DAOstar): 4 weeks\n\nTesting (ensuring that the subURIs work well & that any static data is either uploaded to IPFS or hosted by a trusted 3rd party, for example the Arbitrum Foundation): 2 weeks\n\nOverall: 6 weeks before the proposal is ready to be executed\n\n### Overall Cost\n\nThis proposal does not require any transfer of funds from the DAO treasury.\n\n*Special thanks to @Bobbay, @Matt_StableLab, @raam, @coolhorsegirl, @Srijith-Questbook, @Sinkas, Hayden (BlockworksResearch) and Nick Nahaghi (Hats) for feedback and edits; @krst, @AlexLumley, @Frisson, @dk3, and George Beall (Gauntlet) for the expert sessions, and to Klaus and the rest of the GovHack team for making an awesome event happen at Brussels!*\n\n*EIP-4824 has already been adopted by Snapshot, Aragon, Treasure, 1inch, Optimism Collective (through the Optimism Foundation), and multiple frameworks and DAOs. The effort is supported by grants from the Arbitrum Foundation, Optimism Collective, ENS, Gnosis, Solana and many other stakeholders of the web3 ecosystem. Thank you to everyone:)*",
