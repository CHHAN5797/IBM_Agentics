        "body": "## Simple Summary\n\nA proposal to reduce Liquidation Threshold (LT) and Loan-To-Value (LTV), for CRV on Aave V2 Ethereum.\n\n## Motivation\n\nFollowing our recommendations to decrease Aave’s exposure to CRV on V2 Ethereum [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/gauntlet-recommendation-to-freeze-crv-and-set-crv-ltv-0-on-aave-v2/13644/31), we propose a series of LT and LTV reductions. The [first reduction](https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/255/) in this cycle of LT updates was executed on July 3rd, 2023. Since the initial post proposing to reduce the LTs for CRV, we’ve observed over 12M CRV withdrawn from V2 Ethereum. \n\nGiven the current conditions and protocol usage, we propose 2 options for the community to vote on:\n\n1. “Aggressive” (Chaos recommended) - 6% reduction. This option suggests an LT configuration that optimizes the reduction without significantly increasing the number of accounts eligible for liquidation. The proposed values are set at a margin of 8% from the closest LT figure, which would trigger more substantial liquidations, as can be seen in the supporting graphs [here](https://www.notion.so/chaos-labs/Supporting-Data-ARFC-Chaos-Labs-Risk-Parameter-Updates-CRV-Aave-V2-Ethereum-2023-7-10-32dc4ed994be4029b05af831ce5ea537).\n2. “Moderate” - 3% reduction. This option is aligned with the previous reduction and the [Risk-Off Framework](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/bafkreigdmcfmwvnxfolpds4xkdicgrszgmknig7pz2r2t37tltupdpyfu4) previously approved by the community, with a reduction of up to 3% in any given AIP.\n\nIn the table below, we share data to quantify and visualize the effect of the recommended reductions on protocol users. \n\n| Option | Liquidation Threshold | Accounts Liquidated | Liquidation Value |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Moderate | 52 | 3 | $46 |\n| Aggressive | 49 | 5 | $116 |\n\n*As Liquidation Threshold reductions may lead to user accounts being eligible for liquidations upon their approval, we want to clarify the full implications to the community at each step. Chaos Labs will publicly communicate the planned amendments and list of affected accounts leading to the on-chain execution.*\n\n## Specification\n\n| Asset | Parameter | Current Value | Recommendation | Change |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| CRV | LT | 55 | 52 / 49 | -3% / -6% |\n| CRV | LTV | 49 | 46 / 43 | -3% / -6% |\n\n*Recommended LT and LTV values will be finalized after the Snapshot between the “aggressive” and “moderate” options*\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. Following community feedback, submit the ARFC for a snapshot vote for final approval.\n2. If consensus is reached, submit an Aave Improvement Proposal (AIP) to implement the proposed updates.\n\n# Disclaimer\n\nChaos Labs has not been compensated by any third party for publishing this ARFC.\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain)",

By aligning the risk parameters of USDT with those of USDC, we anticipate an increase in borrowing power for users. This change is expected to stimulate borrowing volume on Aave, thereby contributing to the protocol's revenue. The activation of collateral power for USDT is a strategic move towards creating a more dynamic, efficient, and profitable liquidity environment within the Aave ETH V3 pool.\n\n## Specification\n\nThe following table outlines the proposed risk parameters for USDT in the Aave ETH V3 pool, which will replicate the risk parameters of USDC:\n\n| Parameter | Current Value (USDT) | Proposed Value (USDT) | Current Value (USDC) |\n|-----------|----------------------|-----------------------|----------------------|\n| LTV       | 0%                   | 74%                  | 74%                  |\n| LT        | 0%                   | 76%                  | 76%                  |\n| LB        | 0%                   | 4.5%                 | 4.5%                 |\n\n## Next Steps\n\n- If the ARFC Snapshot is successful, the proposal will be escalated to the Aave Improvement Proposal (AIP) stage for final approval.\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThe Aave Chan Initiative has not been compensated by any third party for publishing this ARFC.\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.",

        "body": "## Simple Summary\n\nA proposal to reduce the Liquidation Threshold (LT) and Loan-To-Value (LTV) and increase Liquidation Bonus (LB) and Reserve Factors (RF) for eleven (11) frozen collateral assets on Aave V2 Ethereum.\n\n## Motivation\n\nIn line with our ongoing commitment to reduce the potential risks associated with V2 markets, we suggest a phased reduction of the **frozen** V2 markets, comprising low-to-medium cap assets with limited liquidity. The following proposal is the first step to reduce capital efficiency across V2 collateral assets, which will be followed up with more detailed plans for additional parameter updates for these assets. \n\n### LT Reductions\n\nImplementing a gradual decrease in LTs effectively diminishes the borrowing power for the existing markets. This proposal offers the community two alternatives - a \"moderate\" and an \"aggressive\" approach for the preliminary LT reduction. \n\n- Aggressive (Chaos Recommendation) -  This option suggests a LT configuration that optimizes reductions without significantly increasing the number of accounts eligible for liquidation. The proposed values are set at a margin of 8% from the closest LT figure which would trigger more substantial liquidations, as can be seen in the supporting graphs [here](https://chaos-labs.notion.site/Supporting-Data-ARFC-Chaos-Labs-Risk-Parameter-Updates-Aave-V2-Ethereum-2023-6-23-338308b47db34c30a92204805f2a1972?pvs=4).\n- Moderate - If the community leans towards a more tempered approach of slowly reducing the Liquidation Thresholds, we propose limiting the LT decrease to a maximum of 10%. Hence, we define the “Moderate” option as the minimum between 10% or the value suggested by the aggressive approach.\n\n- “Aggressive”\n\n| Asset | Current LT | Rec LT | Value Liquidated | Accounts Liquidated |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| BAL | 70% | 55% | $60 | 5 |\n| BAT | 70% | 52% | $610 | 6 |\n| CVX | 45% | 40% | 0 | 1 |\n| DPI | 70% | 42% | 0 | 0 |\n| ENJ | 67% | 60% | $300 | 4 |\n| KNC | 70% | 1% | $1,790 | 7 |\n| MANA | 75% | 62% | $500 | 5 |\n| REN | 60% | 40% | $1,800 | 6 |\n| xSUSHI | 65% | 60% | 0 | 0 |\n| YFI | 65% | 55% | $500 | 2 |\n|ZRX|65%|45%|$500 | 5 |\n- “Moderate”\n\n| Asset | Current LT | Rec LT | Value Liquidated | Accounts Liquidated |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| BAL | 70% | 60% | 0 | 2 |\n| BAT | 70% | 60% | $200 | 3 |\n| CVX | 45% | 40% | 0 | 1 |\n| DPI | 70% | 60% | 0 | 0 |\n| ENJ | 67% | 60% | $300 | 4 |\n| KNC | 70% | 60% | $210 | 1 |\n| MANA | 75% | 65% | $400 | 4 |\n| REN | 60% | 50% | $300 | 4 |\n| xSUSHI | 65% | 60% | 0 | 0 |\n| YFI | 65% | 55% | $500 | 2 |\n|ZRX|65%|55%| 0 | 0|\n\nIn the tables below, we share data to quantify the effect of the recommended reductions on protocol users:\n\n|  | Value liquidated | Accounts liquidated |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| moderate | $1,970 | 20 |\n| aggressive | $4,900 | 34 |\n\n*As Liquidation Threshold reductions may lead to user accounts being eligible for liquidations upon their approval, we want to clarify the full implications to the community at each step. Chaos Labs will publicly communicate the planned amendments and list of affected accounts leading to the on-chain execution.*\n\n### Reduce LTV to zero\n\nLowering the Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio to zero can potentially curb borrowing by less sophisticated users. It's important to note that due to V2's design, users can bypass the LTV limit to borrow up to the LT value.\n\n### RF Increase\n\nProgressively increasing the reserve factors diminishes the interest rate for providing these assets and lowers the suppliers' incentive to supply the assets. In this proposal, we suggest an initial hike of 10% for all inactive assets.\n\n### LB Increase\n\nWe recommend increasing the LB for all proposed assets (excluding BAL and CVX) to 10% to better incentivize liquidations and accommodate for low liquidity for the given assets.\n\n## Specification\n\n| Asset | Cur LT | Rec LT* | Current LTV | Rec LTV | Current RF | Rec RF | Current LB | Rec LB |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| BAL | 70% | 60% / 55% | 65% | 0 | 20% | 30% | 8% | 8% |\n| BAT | 70% | 60% / 52% | 65% | 0 | 20% | 30% | 7.5% | 10% |\n| CVX | 45% | 40% | 35% | 0 | 20% | 30% | 8.5% | 8%  |\n| DPI | 70% | 60% / 42% | 65% | 0 | 20% | 30% | 7.5% | 10% |\n| ENJ | 67% | 60% | 60% | 0 | 20% | 30% | 6% | 10% |\n| KNC | 70% | 60% / 1% | 60% | 0 | 20% | 30% | 10% | 8%  |\n| MANA | 75% | 65% / 62% | 61.5% | 0 | 35% | 45% | 7.5% | 10% |\n| REN | 60% | 50% /40% | 55% | 0 | 20% | 30% | 7.5% | 10% |\n| xSUSHI | 65% | 60% | 50% | 0 | 35% | 45% | 8.5% | 10% |\n| YFI | 65% | 55% | 50% | 0 | 20% | 30% | 7.5% | 10% |\n| ZRX | 65% | 55% / 45% | 55% | 0 | 20% | 30% | 7.5% | 10% |\n\n*Recommended LT values will be finalized after the Snapshot between the aggressive and moderate options\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. Following community feedback, submit the ARFC for a snapshot vote for final approval.\n2. If consensus is reached, submit an Aave Improvement Proposal (AIP) to implement the proposed updates.\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nChaos Labs has not been compensated by any third party for publishing this ARFC.\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain)",

        "body": "---\ntitle: [ARFC] Add native USDC to the Arbitrum V3 pool\nauthor: @marczeller - Aave Chan Initiative\ncreated: 2023-06-06\n---\n\n## Abstract\n\nThis ARFC proposes to add the native version of USDC on Arbitrum to the Aave V3 pool on Arbitrum. The native USDC token will eventually become the \"canon\" version of the USDC stablecoin on the Arbitrum L2. The current USDC onboarded on Aave V3 Arbitrum pool should now be considered \"USDC.e\" as it's a bridged asset with an underlying USDC on Ethereum.\n\n## Motivation\n\nCircle is set to launch a native version of USDC on Arbitrum, which is anticipated to become the primary version of the USDC stablecoin on the Arbitrum L2. This will supersede the current \"USDC.e\" token, which is a bridged asset with an underlying USDC on Ethereum.\n\nFrom our experience with the Avalanche Pool, we've learned that a prudent approach to integrating such a native token involves initially onboarding it with parameters similar to its bridged counterpart, but with more conservative caps. As the native USDC builds secondary liquidity and matures, we can gradually decrease the attractiveness of USDC.e and increase the caps for the native USDC.\n\nThis ARFC is focused solely on the onboarding of the native USDC and does not propose any action for USDC.e. As a result, if this proposal is accepted by the governance, both USDC.e and the native USDC will be onboarded simultaneously on the Arbitrum V3 pool. This strategy aims to ensure a smooth transition and maintain the stability of the Aave V3 pool on Arbitrum.\n\n\n\n## Specification\n\n### Token Information\n\n- Token Symbol: USDC\n- Token Address: [0xaf88d065e77c8cC2239327C5EDb3A432268e5831](https://arbiscan.io/address/0xaf88d065e77c8cC2239327C5EDb3A432268e5831)\n\n### Parameters\n\n| Parameter | USDC.e | USDC (native) |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|LTV|81%|81%|\n|LT|86%|86%|\n|LB|5%|5%|\n|Supply Cap|150M|**41M**|\n|Borrow Cap|100M|**41M**|\n|RF|10%|10%|\n|emode|YES|YES|\n|emode LTV|93%|93%|\n|emode LT|95%|95%|\n|emode LB|1%|1%|\n|Base rate|0%|0%|\n|slope1|3.5%|3.5%|\n|Slope2|60%|60%|\n|optimalUtilization|90%|90%|\n|stable borrowing|YES|NO|\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThis proposal is powered by Skyward.

        "body": "## Simple Summary\n\nA proposal to reduce Liquidation Threshold (LT) and Loan-To-Value (LTV), for CRV on Aave V2 Ethereum.\n\n## Motivation\n\nFollowing our recommendations to decrease Aave’s exposure to CRV on V2 Ethereum [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/gauntlet-recommendation-to-freeze-crv-and-set-crv-ltv-0-on-aave-v2/13644/31), we propose a series of LT and LTV reductions.\n\nAs Liquidation Threshold reductions may lead to user accounts being eligible for liquidations upon their approval, we want to clarify the full implications to the community at each step. To best minimize this impact, we suggest reaching the desired settings by **a series of incremental decreases**, following the [Risk-Off Framework](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/bafkreigdmcfmwvnxfolpds4xkdicgrszgmknig7pz2r2t37tltupdpyfu4) previously approved by the community, with a reduction of up to 3% in any given AIP. In an attempt to avoid liquidations, Chaos Labs will publicly communicate the planned amendments and list of affected accounts leading to the on-chain execution.\n\nIn the graph below, we share data to quantify and visualize the effect of the recommended reductions on protocol users. For the proposed, 3% LT decrease, the impact on users at the time of this post is negligible (2 accounts liquidated, ~3$ liquidated).\n\n![CRV (1)|600x371](upload://tHX5xvHscvxnCa5Bb5KfLENt1HG.png)\n\n\n|Liquidation Treshold| Accounts Liquidated | Liquidation Value |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|55| 2 | ~$3 |\n\n## Specification\n\n| Asset | Parameter | Current Value | Recommendation |Change |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |--- |\n| CRV | LT | 58 | 55 |-3% |\n| CRV | LTV | 52 | 49 |-3% |\n\n## Next Steps\n\n2.
