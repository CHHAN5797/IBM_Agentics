        "body": "Abstract:\nThis Arbitrum Improvement Proposal (AIP) is presented with the vision of further enhancing the Arbitrum ecosystem following the Short Term Incentive Program (STIP). Acknowledging the STIP’s instrumental role in the growth of the Arbitrum ecosystem, this proposal seeks to extend its positive impact by introducing a gas rebate and trading incentive program created by Rage Trade, a native perp aggregator on Arbitrum. Through this initiative, we aspire to not only complement the milestones achieved by the STIP but also to significantly increase the influx of new traders into the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\nMotivation:\nAs the Short Term Incentive Program (STIP) kicks off, it sets the stage for the Arbitrum ecosystem to experience amplified growth. The STIP is poised to play a pivotal role in promoting on-chain activities and reinforcing key protocols. However, there is plenty of opportunity to intensify user engagement and participation, especially when considering innovative platforms like Rage Trade.\n\nThis proposal is driven by the ambition to harness this potential, acting synergistically with the anticipated successes of the STIP. Through Rage Trade’s introduction of a gas rebate and trading incentive program, our objective is not just to elevate trading activity, but also to enhance the overall user experience, attracting and onboarding new traders to the ecosystem. This effort is geared towards empowering platforms that, in line with Arbitrum’s vision, are poised for growth but require additional support to maximize their contribution.\n\nRationale:\n\nThis proposal aligns with Arbitrum’s mission to foster a dynamic and engaged community. By allocating 100% of the grant funds to create a gas rebate and trading incentives program, Rage Trade’s platform aims to refine the user experience of traders while offering gas savings and trading incentives to stimulate a competitive yet cooperative environment.\n\nSpecifications: A detailed breakdown of the platforms and technologies that will be used.\nRage Trade Platform:\n\nAs a prime broker and perpetual aggregator, Rage Trade unifies top decentralized perpetual exchanges across all EVM-compatible chains. It streamlines the trading experience by eliminating complexities associated with collateral and gas fund management, ensuring a faster, more efficient, and user-friendly environment for traders.\n\nGas Tank Mechanism:\n\nThe Gas Tank is a unique feature of Rage Trade that simplifies trading across different chains. Users deposit funds into their account, and a portion goes into the Gas Tank. This fund is then used to cover gas fees across various chains, eliminating the need for users to manage gas fees separately.\n\nSession-Based Trading System:\n\nRage Trade employs a session-based trading system where users create a session that lasts for a specified duration (e.g., 7 days). This system reduces the need for manual transaction signing, making the trading experience smoother and more akin to centralized exchanges.\n\nMulti-Leg Trading and Auto-Populating Bridge:\n\nThe platform allows users to create multiple trades from different chains and perps on Arbitrum, enabling them to spread risk and optimize execution. Additionally, Rage Trade handles all the bridging details, automatically selecting the best bridge or swap routes for seamless trade execution.\n\nCustom Route Selection:\n\nUsers have the option to split their orders based on various criteria such as best execution price, lowest funding fees, or routes with bonuses like emissions or airdrops. This feature provides flexibility and optimization for trade execution.\n\nAggregated Referral & Competitions:\n\nRage Trade aggregates referrals and competitions across different perp protocols, allowing users to participate in various trading competitions and referral programs through a single platform.\n\nIncentive Distribution:\n\nThe proposal involves the distribution of 1.5 million ARB tokens to incentivize trading volume on Rage Trade. The distribution will be structured to reward active traders and participants in trading competitions, fostering increased engagement and liquidity on the platform.\n\nTrading Competitions:\n\nA series of trading competitions will be organized, with ARB tokens allocated as prizes. These competitions aim to attract traders, boost trading volume, and create a vibrant trading community on Rage Trade.\n\nUser Engagement and Performance Metrics:\nRage Trade has successfully cultivated a dynamic user base, boasting 70,000 active traders who regularly engage with our platform. This robust participation is a testament to our platform’s appeal and functionality within the trading community.\n\nIn addition to our active traders, we have nurtured a strong Liquidity Provider (LP) community, with 26,000 LPs contributing to our ecosystem. This substantial number of LPs underscores our platform’s reliability and the trust placed in us by those who provide liquidity, further cementing our role as a pivotal player in the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\nOverall, our protocol’s historical performance not only demonstrates significant growth and adoption but also highlights our consistent delivery of value to our users, traders, and liquidity providers. These metrics are indicative of our integral position within the Arbitrum ecosystem and our potential to further enhance and expand our offerings with sustained support.\n\nRage’s Perpetual Performance:\n\nRage Trade v1 has experienced a remarkable market reception, evidenced by a staggering $735M in Total Trading Volume against Rage’s Total Value Locked (TVL). This impressive figure reflects the high demand and active engagement within our user base, showcasing the platform’s appeal and effectiveness.\n\n\n\n962×642 21.9 KB\nRage’s Vaults Performance:\n\nOur vault offerings, including the 80-20 Tricrypto Vault and GLP Vault, have achieved a notable peak TVL of approximately $19.87 million (at 100% max capacity since launch). This achievement highlights the trust and confidence users place in our vault products.\n\nAt its peak, Rage Trade accounted for about 1.4% of the entire Arbitrum TVL, marking our significant contribution to the overall ecosystem. This percentage represents our substantial impact and the value we add to the broader Arbitrum community.\n\nThe 80-20 Tricrypto vault, in particular, has demonstrated exceptional performance. Over its 10-month lifespan, it outperformed holding GLP by 8%. Specifically, from July 2022 to April 2023, the 80-20 Tricrypto vault yielded a 44% return compared to a 36% return from merely holding GLP, showcasing its effectiveness and profitability.\n\nSteps to Implement: The steps to implement the AIP, including associated costs, manpower, and other resources for each step where applicable. For the avoidance of doubt, any AIPs involving transactions with third parties (such as grants) will need to ensure that applicable legal documentation and procedures are also included.\nTo implement this proposal, we will follow a structured approach, ensuring each phase contributes effectively to the overall goal. Here’s how we plan to proceed:\n\nData Reporting and Transparency: Rage Trade is committed to transparency and will implement Dune dashboards for real-time tracking of all relevant metrics. These dashboards will ensure community members have access to up-to-date data, reflecting our progress and adherence to the commitments outlined in this proposal. This approach emphasizes our dedication to transparency and accountability within the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\nIncentive Allocation: We will begin by using a portion of the ARB tokens for our gas rebate program to offset gas fees for our users. This will serve as the initial spark to ignite trading activities on the Rage Trade platform.\n\nFee Offset & Trading Competitions: We will then allocate the remaining tokens to incentivize trading, including trade competitions and offsetting fees implemented by integrated perp protocols. The trading competitions will be strategically scheduled over time to ensure ongoing participation and interest.\n\nRegular Updates and Reporting: Throughout the implementation, we will continuously monitor platform performance, trader engagement, and community feedback. This will allow us to make real-time adjustments and improvements where necessary. To maintain transparency, we will provide the community with regular updates and reports. These will include key performance metrics and insights gained from the implementation process.\n\nReview and Analysis: At the end of the implementation phase, we will conduct a thorough review. This will involve analyzing successes, identifying areas for improvement, and extracting key learnings for future initiatives.\n\nBy following these steps, we aim to ensure not just the successful implementation of the proposal but also to contribute valuable insights for the continuous growth and development of the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\nTimeline: Relevant timing details, including but not limited to start date, milestones, and completion dates.\nThe implementation of this proposal is structured into a 4-month period, with each month focusing on specific objectives and milestones:\n\nMonth 1 - Initiation and Setup (Immediately upon approval):\n\nAllocation of ARB tokens to the designated multisig wallet to immediately initiate gas rebates and trading fee offsets. Setup of the Dune dashboard for tracking key metrics such as trading volume and unique traders. Announcement of the initiative and upcoming trading competitions to the community.\n\nMonth 2 - Launch of Trading Competitions:\n\nOfficial launch of the first set of trading competitions.\n\nActive monitoring of trading activities and engagement levels.\n\nFirst monthly update provided to the community, highlighting early results and trader participation.\n\nMonth 3 - Mid-term Review and Adjustments:\n\nComprehensive review of the first two months, analyzing trader engagement and competition outcomes.\n\nAdjustments made to competitions and incentives based on feedback and data analysis.\n\nSecond monthly update provided, including insights and any changes implemented.\n\nMonth 4 - Final Push and Comprehensive Analysis:\n\nContinued incentivization and promotion of trading activities.\n\nFinal monthly update provided, leading up to the comprehensive quarterly report.\n\nPreparation of the detailed analysis report, evaluating the proposal’s success based on predefined objectives.\n\nPost-4-Month Period - Evaluation and Reporting:\n\nRelease of a comprehensive quarterly report, detailing the overall impact of the proposal on trading volume, trader engagement, and growth within the Arbitrum ecosystem. Evaluation of the initiative’s success and consideration of potential future actions based on the outcomes.\n\nThis timeline ensures a structured approach to implementing the proposal, with regular updates and transparency. It allows for adjustments based on real-time data and community feedback, ensuring the initiative remains aligned with its goal of driving growth within the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\nKey Performance Indicators (KPIs):\n\nTo measure the success of achieving the grant objectives, we will focus on the following Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):\n\nDaily Volume: Aiming for a 30-day moving average of $10M in daily volume.\nDaily Traders: Targeting a 30-day moving average of 300 unique traders.\nIntegration: Committing to integrate 1 or more perpetual DEXes per 2 weeks (accounting for audit time).\nThese KPIs will serve as benchmarks to gauge our progress and effectiveness in utilizing the grant to drive growth and engagement within the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\nGrant Breakdown:\nRage Trade aims to leverage the grant to attract a substantial influx of users to the Arbitrum ecosystem, bolstering user interaction, transaction volume, TVL, and overall activity.\n\nStrategically, Rage Trade will allocate ~ 33% of the grant to gas rebates, with the other ~ 66% of the grant being directed towards offsetting integrated perp protocols’ trading fees and various trading competitions. The endgame is to amplify user onboarding and trading enthusiasm, resonating with genuine market dynamics.\n\nIt’s crucial to clarify that rebate rates will be determined by the genuine fees incurred by users. If our partnering protocols grant separate rebates or rewards, Rage Trade commits to ensuring that the total sum of rebates will never surpass the fees accrued. Throughout this promotional phase, trade-to-earn schemes will not be entertained. Additionally, the Rage Trade team will vigilantly deter and counteract wash trading and Sybil-attack incidents. Offending addresses linked with such activities will be publicly disclosed and denied the associated rebates.\n\nGas Rebates Explained:\nOnce a week, traders will receive ARB tokens as a gas rebate, mirroring the gas fees they’ve incurred throughout the week. This rebate system ensures that users can trade more freely, knowing a portion of their gas fees will be returned. The gas rebate will be uniformly applied across all protocols integrated with Rage Trade on Arbitrum, ensuring fairness and consistency for all traders. The rebate amount a trader receives will be directly proportional to the actual gas fees they’ve paid, eliminating any potential for manipulative practices like trade-to-earn schemes.\n\nFee Rebates Explained:\n\nARB tokens will be rewarded as fee rebates to our traders every Friday, reflecting the fees they’ve accumulated over the week.\n\nThis fee waiver will be consistently applied across all collaborating protocols.\n\nTraders’ rebate entitlements will strictly correlate with their actual trading fees, nullifying the chance for trade-to-earn practices. The rate of expenditure from the grant will be contingent on the volume of organic trading transpiring each week. The Rage Trade team pledges to continually identify and thwart wash trading and sybil-attack attempts.\n\nTo safeguard the integrity of the campaign, the specifics of the anti-wash-trading & anti-sybil-attack measures will be kept confidential and will be communicated post-event, mirroring best practices employed in protocol airdrop launches.\n\nExample of Fee Structure Post-Reduction:\n\nIf additional perps trading mechanisms in the Arbitrum realm are incorporated with Rage Trade amidst this campaign, the fee waiver will extend to those as well.\n\nIntegrated protocol trading fee rates before and after reduction\n\nGMX V1: 0.1% → 0%\n\nGMX V2: 0.05% / 0.07% → 0%\n\nOverall Cost: The total cost to implement the AIP.\nThe total cost to implement this AIP for Rage Trade is 1.5M ARB tokens. This cost is solely dedicated to funding trading competitions and volume incentives on the Rage Trade platform. The breakdown is as follows:\n\nGas Rebates: 500k ARB tokens will be allocated for offsetting gas fees when trading perps on Arbitrum.\n\nTrading Fee Rebates & Competitions: The remaining 1m ARB will be used as trading fee offsets and trading competitions.\n\nThere are no additional costs involved in this proposal. The entire 1.5M ARB token request is focused on directly incentivizing users and enhancing their trading experience on Rage Trade.",

        "body": "## Constitutional / Non-Constitutional\n\nNon-Constitutional\n\n## Abstract\n\nTally has contributed to the Arbitrum DAO as a service provider since the DAO was created one year ago, serving as the home for [onchain governance](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum), [security council elections](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/council/security-council/election/0/round-2), and [delegation](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/delegates). We’ve gathered feedback about how we can improve our support for Arbitrum through many conversations over the past year with DAO stakeholders including delegates, contributors, and Foundation representatives. We propose to expand our support for the Arbitrum DAO by improving the proposal process, upgrading the Governor contracts, and highlighting delegate contributions. We also propose to ensure that the DAO is set up for success by researching specifications for partial delegation and shielded voting.\n\n## Motivation\n\nArbitrum is the largest and most decentralized DAO in the world. Tally is highly invested in the success of both the Arbitrum DAO specifically and the Arbitrum community as a whole. We have a strong track record as an Arbitrum governance service provider, [ecosystem builder](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/tally-final-stip-round-1/17557), and [delegate](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/delegate/0xfrisson.eth). Tally continuously ships improvements for the Arbitrum DAO, including [transfer actions](https://x.com/tallyxyz/status/1732425795262714363?s=20), [improved Safe support](https://x.com/tallyxyz/status/1714647532423561257?s=20), [proposal collaboration](https://x.com/tallyxyz/status/1743325532786168149?s=20), and the [nominee selection stage](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-changes-to-the-constitution-and-the-security-council-election-process/20856/9?u=frisson) of Security Council elections. This proposal would enable us to invest more resources into the Arbitrum DAO and scale up our impact.\n\nThe majority of the improvements outlined in this proposal are specific to Arbitrum's unique implementation of onchain governance and will not be re-used in other DAOs. We are long-term partners to the Arbitrum DAO who plan to continue investing specifically in making Arbitrum governance great. \n\n## Rationale\n\nThis proposal contributes to Arbitrum [Community Values](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/dao-constitution#section-6-community-values) by making the Arbitrum DAO more socially inclusive, technically inclusive, and user-focused. Our proposed improvements make it easier for contributors of all backgrounds and technical abilities to engage with Arbitrum governance.\n\n## Specifications and Steps to Implement\n\nWe propose to expand our support for the Arbitrum DAO by improving the proposal process, upgrading the Governor contracts, and highlighting delegate contributions. We also propose to ensure that the DAO is set up for success by developing a specification for partial delegation and shielded voting.\n\n**Improve the proposal process** \n*Watch a demo video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yORl1yZPt7Q) - note that this demo is designed to provide a general overview of the user experience. It is not a final design.*\n\n* Link forum proposal posts and Tally proposals so that delegates can create Tally proposals from forum posts, see forum proposal comments directly on Tally, and be updated by a Tally Discourse bot when onchain proposals are created.\n  * In order to show posts on the proposal page, Tally would need [Embedding permission](https://meta.discourse.org/t/embed-discourse-comments-on-another-website-via-javascript/31963)\n  * In order to post \"this proposal is now onchain (link)\", the Tally Discourse bot would need an API key with topics.writepermission from https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/admin/api/keys/new\n* Build a diff checker into Tally proposals that shows what text has changed from Snapshot without having to click back over to Snapshot, to help delegates understand any relevant changes from the temp check phase to the onchain governance phase.\n* Enable cancel functionality on Tally proposals so proposal creators can cancel onchain proposals if there are mistakes. (see upgrade Governor contracts section)\n* Develop full proposal execution integration by dynamically showing [each phase of proposal execution](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/concepts/lifecycle-anatomy-aip-proposal#the-lifecycle-of-an-arbitrum-improvement-proposal) with accurate time stamps so that contributors and delegates can easily manage proposals through the execution process.\n* Improve support for [late quorum extension](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/dao-glossary#late-quorum-extension) on Tally so onchain proposals are automatically extended on Tally when late quorum extension is triggered.\n* Fully integrate the [quorum of each Governor](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/dao-faqs#what-determines-the-quorum-minimum-votes-required-for-a-governance-proposal) throughout Tally, including on the proposal page and the delegates page so that delegates always know exactly how much voting power is required to reach quorum.\n* Show [Security Council](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/concepts/security-council#the-role-of-the-security-council) transactions on the main [Arbitrum DAO page](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum) on Tally so the DAO can easily view actions taken by the Security Council.\n\n**Upgrade Governor contracts**\n*We’re planning to partner with [Scopelift](https://scopelift.co/) to implement the upgrades. Scopelift is the developer of Flexible Voting and has deep experience with high-value governance contract upgrades.*\n\n* Add a [cancel() function](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/92ff025622cdf6694318fc11af1c995236793a77/contracts/governance/Governor.sol#L455-L473) to the Arbitrum DAO’s implementation of OpenZeppelin Governor so proposal creators can cancel onchain proposals if there are mistakes.\n* Add [Flexible Voting](https://github.com/ScopeLift/flexible-voting) to the Arbitrum DAO Governors to enable future innovations like voting from Orbit chains, voting from DeFi contracts, and shielded voting.\n\n**Highlight delegate contributions**\n*Watch a demo video [here](https://youtube.com/watch?v=WY1jQ2tP70U) - note that this demo is designed to provide a general overview of the user experience.

        "author": "0xA5dF0cf3F95C6cd97d998b9D990a86864095d9b0",
        "body": "Abstract\ntl;dr: AIP-1.1 proposes (1) a lockup, (2) a budget and (3) transparency reporting regarding the 7.5% of the $ARB tokens distributed to the Foundation’s “Administrative Budget Wallet”.\n\nThe Administrative Budget Wallet will be used for covering ongoing administrative and operational costs of The Arbitrum Foundation, payment of service providers, and for the purpose of fostering the growth and development of the Arbitrum ecosystem. In respect to the 7.5% that has been distributed to the Administrative Budget Wallet, a transparency report regarding the 0.5% that has already been transferred is available here 163.\n\nThe remaining 7% of tokens will not be used until the approval of a budget, such as the one proposed in this AIP. The proposed budget is in-line with the Foundation’s strategic needs to represent and service the DAO and the allocation is smaller than initial allocations to peer foundations. This AIP proposes placing the 7% outstanding distribution in a smart contract-controlled lockup – linearly unlocking over 4 years – alongside transparency report structures to allow the DAO to periodically monitor expenditures and other activities of the Foundation.\n\nThe Administrative Budget Wallet will be used in pursuit of the Foundation’s mission statement as set out in the bylaws 24, which includes financing technical improvements and operations of the Arbitrum network, fostering ecosystem growth through grants to align with partner projects and educational initiatives with in-person and online events.\n\nMotivation\nOn March 16, 2023, the Arbitrum networks (Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova) were decentralized and given to the newly formed Arbitrum DAO. Included in this transition were:\n\n-Control of the upgradeability and technical future of the chains\n-Control over the DAO treasury\n-Control over net fee revenue - i.e. the net difference between fees collected by on-chain operations and L1 fees paid by the Sequencer\n-All Arbitrum social media platforms and accounts\n-Ability to elect and, if deemed appropriate, remove the Security Council and Directors\n\nFull responsibility of the chain’s technology, future, and fee revenue were given to the DAO directly. With the DAO assuming those rights and controls, the DAO also assumed the responsibility to fund the ongoing operations of the chains and the costs of running critical chain infrastructure, including RPCs, the Sequencer, and third-party vendors and service contracts.\n\nWhile there are many activities that the DAO can do directly on-chain, several of its responsibilities require a representative that can engage, maintain and enter new agreements with service providers to run infrastructure that’s critical for the ecosystem (e.g. servers, RPCs, block explorers, data feeds and analytics platforms, and tooling), and ensure that both the chain and the ecosystem have the support they need to continue to thrive. In order to ensure a smooth transition to the DAO without any interruption of services, it was necessary to create an organization that would be ready to service the DAO immediately from launch.\n\nThe Arbitrum Foundation was created to fill this need, with its mission and scope outlined across the Foundation Bylaws 24. Prior to the launching of the DAO, The Arbitrum Foundation assumed responsibilities for funding and running chain infrastructure. However, in an arrangement that appears to be unique amongst Arbitrum’s peers, the Foundation does not receive or control the net revenue from transaction fees as this is given directly to the DAO treasury.\n\nThe DAO is also tasked with fostering and developing the Arbitrum ecosystem, where the DAO may seek to partner with companies or organizations that either cannot or will not publicly negotiate collaborations or partnerships due to confidentiality and other operational requirements. Often, large enterprises negotiate partnership opportunities in private without public processes, where these relationships can only be disclosed after they are agreed upon. Having a well-funded Foundation empowered to represent the DAO in this arena, alongside peer foundations, is in the best interests of the DAO to further develop the growth of the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\nRationale\nWhile the need for the Foundation to exist and represent the DAO is well-motivated, it became clear through community discourse around AIP-1 that it was important to have additional insight and restrictions on the Foundation’s initial funding. This AIP-1.1 proposes a detailed set of controls and initiatives to achieve that goal.\n\n1. Smart Contract Lockup:\n\nThe remaining 7% of ARB tokens in the “Administrative Budget Wallet” will be subject to a four year lockup schedule, unlocking on a continuous linear time basis commencing from the date of the Snapshot approval of AIP-1.1 by the DAO (i.e., a total of 175m $ARB released over each year for 4 years). The lockup will be enforced on-chain through a smart contract which will designate a multisig wallet controlled by The Arbitrum Foundation as the beneficiary. The lockup contract will be configured in a manner that allows the DAO to adjust future funding and/or modify the unlock schedule.\n\n2. Operating Budget:\n\nBelow is a proposed annual operational budget for the first year of the Foundation. While the operational costs are denominated in USD, the expectation is that approximately half will be paid in USD and half will be paid in locked $ARB tokens.\n\nAs this will be the first year of the Foundation’s operation and as the Foundation is still young at the time of this AIP, it goes without saying that these are estimates with the expectation that this will be an upper bound on the operational costs for the first 12 months. The transparency reports described in the next section will be an opportunity to track the actual expenses against the budgeted categories and keep the community informed.\n\nOperating Budget: Cost ($USD)\nGeneral and Administrative:\t$16,000,000\nR&D:\t$9,000,000\nTechnical Infrastructure:\t$5,000,000\nEvents, Marketing & Communications:\t$6,000,000\nTotal - Next Twelve Months:\t$36,000,000\n(50% $USD/50% $ARB)\n\n*The General and Administrative line-item includes personnel, contractors, legal, insurance and other operational costs. As of the date of this AIP, the Foundation currently has five full-time contributors, 8 contractors, and the Security Council engaged to support the Arbitrum ecosystem. The Foundation’s budget anticipates the need to hire an additional 15 full-time contributors across technical, growth and community functions over the course of this year.\n\nThis operating budget presents best-faith estimates of the Foundation’s anticipated budgetary needs which may be subject to change.\n\n3. Ecosystem Growth Initiatives\n\nAny additional funds released in compliance with the lock-up schedule above will be made available, but not necessarily deployed, to opportunistically pursue ecosystem growth opportunities and strategic partnerships on behalf of the DAO. The expectation is that the vast majority of ecosystem growth funds will be paid in tokens, and thus will not require the Foundation to sell any tokens. Wherever reasonable, the Foundation will include additional lockups and/or vesting when making distributions in tokens.\n\nThe Mission Statement in the Foundation’s bylaws 24 highlights the varied nature of the opportunities the Foundation intends to pursue, and a set of KPIs that can track all of these opportunities being developed. The basis of those KPIs will stem from a focus on onboarding and growing both the developer and user base of the Arbitrum ecosystem, attracting best-in-class infrastructure providers to the network, expanding across various industries, use-cases and scope of projects that engage with Arbitrum technology. The ultimate goal of the Foundation is to continue to foster the development of the technology and expand the Arbitrum ecosystem globally.\n\nIn addition to the Foundation’s processes for selecting grants, it is important to note that the DAO maintains control over the 3.527 billion $ARB and has the ability to distribute any additional grants as it sees fit. Additionally, should the DAO choose, it has the ability to trigger the inflation of the total supply of $ARB which will supplement the on-chain DAO treasury with 2% growth of the total supply of $ARB each year.\n\n4. Transparency Reports\n\nThe Foundation understands and agrees that the community should have oversight across how these funds are being utilized to gain comfort that spending is in the interest of the community. In furtherance of this goal, the Foundation is committed to providing a comprehensive annual report and a semi-annual progress update. This will provide the community with a better understanding of the Foundation’s expenditures, balance sheet and its pursuit of ecosystem growth opportunities alongside partnership developments, as well as the various internal and external committees and stakeholders that are involved in the decision making process.\n\nThe Foundation is continuing to build out its internal personnel to service grant requests and has already engaged a DAO service provider to assist with the administrative components of servicing grants. The Foundation is also talking with a number of different external service providers to assist in both the review and diligence processes.\n\nThe financial element of these transparency reports will include a breakdown of operational costs incurred while running the Foundation, including infrastructure spending for the Arbitrum chains, events, community building efforts, grants, etc.\n\nIn addition to the aforementioned reports, the Foundation is providing an initial transparency report alongside this AIP covering all major actions and decisions the Foundation made during set-up, including the costs incurred up until now, which can be found here 163.\n\nSteps to Implement\n\n1. Foundation to deploy smart contract vesting wallet in the specified configuration and transfer 700 million $ARB to it.\n2. Foundation to implement all processes described in this AIP.\nTimeline\n\nThis AIP-1.1 shall be posted on the DAO forum and will have at least a 72-hour period for DAO comments and input. After the end of the 72-hour period and appropriate updates incorporating DAO feedback, this AIP-1.1 will be posted for vote on Snapshot for an additional 7 days.\n\n",

The goal is to assess the incentives' impact on the delegates' active participation and involvement in the DAO's governance. *This proposal is subject to changes.*\n\n## **Motivation**\n\nThis proposal represents an improved version compared to previous initiatives and requests for comments (RFCs):\n\n- [[RFC-2] Delegate Incentive System for ArbitrumDAO](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rfc-2-delegate-incentive-system-for-arbitrumdao/15720)\n- [[DRAFT] Experimental Incentive System for Active ArbitrumDAO Delegates](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/draft-experimental-incentive-system-for-active-arbitrumdao-delegates/16501)\n\nWe have developed this new proposal considering the comments and observations provided by other delegates. Our additional motivation lies in the recent increase in proposals and increased activity within ArbitrumDAO. We believe that delegates are the core base of the DAO and should be properly incentivized to maintain active participation, both in voting and feedback on proposals and in the ideation of governance processes.\n\n# **Delegate Incentive System**\n\n## **Before reading the proposal, note how we have decided to structure it**\n\nThis proposal is structured into four main sections:\n\n* **Option 1:** This is our main proposal detailing all the specifications of the incentive system.\n* **Option 2:** Introduces the implementation of \"Karma\" to automate certain processes. It's important to note that this option entails additional costs.\n* **General Summary:** An overview of the proposed items.\n* **Next Steps:** Voting deadline\n\n# **Option 1 - Main Proposal**\n\n# Specifications\n\n## Duration of the Incentive System\n\nWe've allocated an initial trial period of 6 months. This timeframe should allow us to gather initial metrics to gauge the system's functionality and its anticipated impact.\n\n## Total Number of Delegates to Receive Incentives\n\nWe have set the number at **50 delegates**. This figure isn't based on specific reasoning, but we believe it's a reasonable starting point.\n\n## Funding\n\n- Incentives for delegates: 1,500,000 ARB\n- Incentive Program Administrator: 25,000 ARB\n\n## Delegate Selection Process\n\n### Requirements\n\nBased on the feedback received, we've opted for a single tier instead of a multi-tiered program, allowing a wider array of participants, the requirements would be as follows:\n\n* **Voting Power**: >50K ARB, corresponding to 194 delegates. (Source:[ Arbitrum Delegates and Voting Power - Dune Analytics](https://dune.com/pandajackson42/arbitrum-delegates-and-voting-power)).\n* **Delegates to Receive Incentives**: 50.\n* **Budget Allocation**: 1,500,000 ARB (5,000 ARB per delegate per month).\n* **Historical Participation Rate (Tally)**: Over 25%\n\n> **Note:**\n> * So following this model, the top fifty delegates - defined by their final score - within the range, would be compensated\n> * The 5000 ARB per month is the max amount a delegate could earn, but this amount could be lower depending on their score.\n> * Certain votes won't be counted towards the Tally Participation Rate, as detailed in the following links:\n> 1. [Core Test Proposal](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/60371879178081104082641012273221287927865067413661362234634146098631763379427)\n> 2. [Treasury test proposal](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/110793123084980773896129216551445203207286848914653873956746115694475823589450)  \n> 3. [[OLD] AIP-1.1 - Lockup, Budget, Transparency ](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/79904733039853333959339953965823982558487956291458141923259498272549038367575)\n\n### Incentive Program Application\n\nDelegates matching the requirements must confirm their participation in the Incentive System in the forum (a dedicated channel will be established for this). They must post using the template provided below, within a 7-day application window.\n\n**Incentive Program Confirmation Template:**\n* Forum Username (Link):\n* Twitter Profile (Link):\n* Snapshot Profile (Link):\n* Tally Profile with Exact All-time Participation Rate % (Link):\n\n> **Note:**\n> * Failing to send a confirmation message will exclude you from the incentive system, regardless of eligibility.\n> * Applicants should ensure accuracy in numbers and links, facilitating quicker verification.\n\n**Eligible delegates for the incentive program will be announced on the forum.**\n\n## Scoring and Framework\n\nTo determine which delegates will be paid on a monthly basis, we will use a point system and a framework that will be made public.\n\n![scores.png](ipfs://bafybeieuu4yypwmkapdkznz4arvsci7t7ond4a7qh55us2fuz5ijjbhwsa)\n    \n[Framework - Experimental Incentive](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hTRXhxcw3o8RJYWw0Nvf48Ak0ihOe5kUJUcTWH0IDgg/edit#gid=374367862)\n\n### Details: Terminology, Symbols, and Formulas\n\nWe explain in detail the framework and points system:\n\n* **Delegates (DD):** Delegates with right to access to incentives\n* **Ranking (TOP):** Delegate's position in this Dune table https://dune.com/pandajackson42/arbitrum-delegates-and-voting-power\n* **Funds ARB (FARB):** The amount of ARB allocated per month to the delegates' payment\n* **Activity Weight (%):** Represents the weight assigned to each key activity to be measured in delegates.\n  * **Participation Rate (PR) - Weight 20:** Percentage of the total participation of the member in votes. This parameter is extracted from Tally. This is the only parameter that is not reset monthly.\n    * **PR% formula: (PR * 20) / 100**\n  * **Snapshot Voting (SV) - Weight 15:** Percentage of delegate participation in snapshot voting. This parameter is reset at the beginning of each month.\n    * **Tn:** Number of total proposals that were sent to snapshots for voting in the month.\n    * **Rn:** Number of proposals the delegate voted on in the month.\n    * **SV% formula: (SV(Tn) /SV(Fn)) * 15**\n  * **Tally Voting (TV) - Weight 25:** Percentage of delegate participation in on-chain voting in Tally. This parameter is reset at the beginning of each month.\n    * **Tn:** Number of total proposals that were sent to Tally for voting in the month.\n    * **Rn:** Number of proposals the delegate voted in Tally in the month.\n    * **TV% formula: (TV(Fn) - TV(Rn)) * 25**\n  * **Communicating Rationale (CR) - Weight 25:** Percentage of communication threads with the justification of the delegate's vote on the proposals sent to snapshots and Tally (if necessary if the vote does not change). This parameter is reset at the beginning of each month.\n    * **Tn:** Total number of proposals that were submitted to a vote.\n    * **Rn:** Number of real communication rational threads where the delegate communicated and justified his/her decision.\n    * **CR% formula: (CR(Fn) - CR(Rn)) * 25**\n  * **Commenting Proposals (CP) - Weight 15:** Percentage of proposals where the delegate asked questions or generated important discussion for the advancement of the proposal. This parameter is reset at the beginning of each month.\n    * **Tn:** Total number of formal proposals posted on the forum.\n    * **Rn:** Number of actual proposals where the delegate made a genuine and quality contribution. Spam messages will not be considered.\n    * **CP% formula: (CP(Fn) - CP(Rn)) * 15**\n  * **Bonus Point (BP) - Extra +30% TP:** This parameter is extra. If the delegate makes a significant contribution to the DAO, he/she is automatically granted +40% extra TP. This parameter is at the discretion of the program administrator. This parameter is reset at the beginning of each month\n\n* **Total Participation (TP):** Sum of the results of activities performed by the delegate. A TP% of 100 indicates full participation.\n  * **TP% formula: PR% + SV% + TV% + CR% + CP% + BP**\n* **Payment ARB (PARB):** Final amount of ARB that the delegate will receive based on his TP% and his position in the table.\n  * **PARB formula: IF(TP% >=100; 50000 ;(5000 * TP% / 100))**\n\n#### Parameter summary\n\n* **Activity Weight (%):**\n  * **Participation Rate (PR) - Weight 20%**\n  * **Snapshot Voting (SV) - Weight 15%**\n  * **Tally Voting (TV) - Weight 25%**\n  * **Communicating Rationale (CR) - Weight 25%**\n  * **Commenting on Proposals (CP) - Weight 15%**\n  * **Bonus Point (BP) - Extra +30% TP (Total Participation)**\n* **Total Participation (TP):**\n  * **TP = PR% + SV% + TV% + CR% + CP% + BP**\n\n### Weight and activity considerations\n\nThe activities that have been considered in shaping the framework and scope are measurable activities that we believe can positively impact governance.\n\nWe have distributed the weight according to the type of activity, as we believe this is the fairest way to do it at the moment.\n\n**Surely both the activities and the weightings are far from being the final parameters, ideally after these 6 months we should have a clear idea of how to modify certain parameters or which ones to add/remove.**\n\n> **Note:**\n> We have not included the governance call in the list of activities because we feel that it may be difficult for delegates in different time zones to attend because of the specific timing of the call. Plus some delegates might not want to dox their voices.\n\n\n### Total Participation (TP)\n\nThe 50 delegates who conclude the month with a **TP score of +60%** will be the ones to receive incentives based on the result provided by the **PARB** parameter.\n\nShould more than 50 delegates have a **TP score of +60%**, only the top 50 scores will be selected.\n\nIf fewer than 50 delegates have a **TP score of +60%**, only those meeting the criteria will be compensated\n\n> **Note:**\n> In the exceptional circumstance where scores are identical or more than 50 delegates exceed +90%, the entire month's budget may be distributed amongst all delegates with such scores. This decision is at the discretion of the program administrator.\n\n### Bonus Point\n\nShould a delegate propose or actively participate in an enhancement proposal for Arbitrum DAO and execute it, like the [Arbitrum’s Short-Term Incentive Program (Arbitrum Improvement Proposal](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrums-short-term-incentive-program-arbitrum-improvement-proposal/16131)), they will be granted an additional +30% to their TP score for making a valuable contribution to the DAO. This could also be a governance process enhancement proposal or a template for grant selection.\n\nWe understand that this is one of the weakest points of the proposal and we believe it is very objective. To assess this point we will try to answer these questions\n\n- Is the proposal of interest to the ArbitrumDAO, does it cover any vertical that has not yet been worked on?\n- Is the proposal well described, does it have details of the objectives it wants to achieve?\n- Does the proposal generate debate among delegates, is there interest among DAO members (for or against) about the proposal?\n- Does the proposer exhaust existing resources to demonstrate that their proposal adds value to ArbitrumDAO (governance calls, responds in the governance forum, etc).\n- Was the proposal put to a vote: was it a close vote or a resounding no? \n\nWhen evaluating the bonus points we will try to answer these questions and the administrator will have to upload a post to the forum with the answer and a justification of why he/she grants the bonus point. We also look forward to hearing the community's opinion on the matter.\n\n### Parameter Snapshot\n\nWhen we refer to a month, we consider from the first day of the month 00:00 UTC to the last day 23:59hs UTC of each month. Within these days and hours, delegates have the opportunity to perform all actions to meet the parameters. The month's activities conclude on the last day of the month, so delegates must be punctual.\n\n### Delegate Responsibilities\n\nDelegates are responsible for keeping track of their actions. At the end of the month, they have until the 3rd of the following month to submit a forum post with the following requirements:\n\n* A copy (Link) of the framework with their activity data for that month.\n* Additionally, the post must have a summary with all the links including:\n  * Snapshot voting link\n  * Forum post link explaining the reasoning behind the snapshot vote\n  * Tally voting link\n  * Forum post link explaining the tally vote reasoning (if you have changed your vote)\n  * Commenting on Proposals link (only those that went to snapshots)\n* The summary should also include:\n  * Delegate proposal links\n  * Links to any significant contribution (discussion, questions, suggestions, etc.) made to a proposal.\n\n> **Note:**\n> * Delegates failing to post the requested information will not receive incentives.\n> * To avoid forum spam and disarray, we will ask the facilitators to add a channel for the incentive system so delegates can input all their information there.\n\n### Incentive System Administrator Responsibilities\n\nAfter the delegates post and present their results in the framework, the incentive system administrator has 10 days to gather all the information, review, verify, and unify it. Then, present all the unified data on the forum in the [framework](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hTRXhxcw3o8RJYWw0Nvf48Ak0ihOe5kUJUcTWH0IDgg/edit#gid=374367862) and attach a summary explaining that month's final result.\n\nOnce the final result is presented, delegates have 2 days to file a claim in case of disagreement.\n\n#### Dispute\n\nDelegates have a 2-day window to dispute if they disagree with the results presented by the Incentive System Administrator.\n\nTo raise a dispute, they must do so via a forum post with the following template:\n\n* Title: Dispute\n* Username\n* Reason for dispute (be detailed)\n\nThe system administrator must promptly address the issue, resolving it within a maximum of 2 days.\n\n#### Incentive System Ban\n\nShould a delegate or any community member attempt to deceive or game the incentive system, they will be banned. This decision is at the discretion of the program administrator.\n\nWe must remember that this system is experimental, and we hope for community members' cooperation for its success. \n\n### Payment Execution\n\nIf all goes according to plan, the delegate payments are expected to be sent as a proposal to Tally, with full details of the payments, between the 16th and 17th. This will be repeated for the 6 months, so that the DAO has control over the incentive program and can cut it off whenever it wants.\n\n**Payments are made in ARB tokens.**\n\n#### Considerations\n\nLike every new and experimental system, there may be delays, so please be [patient](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lll5H9ekrsQPe7zMbvkiWTIzevlwpSJLkQql8B8UhTA/edit#gid=0).\n\nEstimated schedule:\n\n![schedule.png](ipfs://bafkreie7nlxyh7jx7myxgfj6eqogu6p7kfebmokq3v5fvxzskmmb7j2h64)\n    \n### Administrator Perspective\n\n1. Start of the month: Track delegate participation in governance.\n2. Last day of the month: Begin collecting delegate posts from the forum.\n3. Review all the information, check for accuracy, and compile it into the framework.\n4. Establish the results within the given timeframe.\n5. If everyone agrees, send a proposal to Tally with the payment details, to be voted on.\n6. Keep the DAO informed\n\n## Incentive system administrator\n\nGiven the short duration of the program and the lack of a DAO Facilitator, SEED Latam is willing to assume the administration of this program. This means that our delegation won't participate in it and that the adminstration won't be carried out by myself, but by the organization SEED Latam.\n\nHowever, we're also open to a group of delegates or potentially a third party administering this program, in which case we would obviously provide any assistance necessary.\n\nFor the adminstration of said program the budget would be 25,000 ARB. This payment will also be divided into 6 months and will be sent in the proposal to Tally along with the payments to the delegates. In this way the DAO will have control over the administrator.\n\n---\n\n# **Option 2 - Karma automation for delegate incentive program**\n\n### Features summary\n\nKarma will develop features to enhance administrator efficiency and provide transparency to the Arbitrum community. The features that will be built include:\n\n1. Automated fetching of all delegates with Voting Power (VP) over 50k, along with their details.\n2. Profile display for each delegate, showing their voting history and voting reasons they post on Snapshot, Tally or Forum.\n3. Calculation and display of PR, SV, TV, CR, CP (TBD if CP can be automated) for each delegate as specified in the proposal.\n**Karma will implement automatically fetching delegates’ forum data**\n4. Functionality for the Administrator to allocate Bonus Points.\n5. Computation and presentation of the final Total Points (TP) and PARBB for each delegate on: `arbitrum.karmahq.xyz/delegate-compensation`.\n\n**This automation eliminates the need for delegates to manually report their monthly activities.**\n\n### Timeline\n\n- **Week 1:** Collaborating with administrators and community members to finalize the project requirements.\n- **Weeks 2 and 3:** Initiating the sprint to design and develop all the features\n- **Week 4:** The product will undergo comprehensive end-to-end testing and be deployed to production. At this stage, the community will gain full access to all features.\n- **Week 5 and Beyond:** Implementation of bug fixes and enhancements based on insights and feedback gathered.\n\n### Payment Schedule\n\n- **Payment 1:** 10k ARB when the proposal passes and the project is kicked off.\n- **Payment 2:** 10K ARB on successful launch of the product (After week 4 per the timeline above)\n- **Payment 3:** 10K ARB 2 months after launch as we continue to fix bugs and make enhancements (week 12 of program kickoff)\n\n**Karma payments will also be executed from the DAO and tracked by the program administrator.**\n\n### Cost\n\n- 30000 ARB\n\n\n## **SEED Latam Commitment**\n\nSeed Latam is committed to monitoring the proper functioning of Karma and collecting feedback from the community on the dashboard's performance. We also commit to collaborating with Karma so that the dashboard meets the needs of the incentive system.\n\nAs with Option 1, we are also open to having a group of delegates or potentially a third party administer Karma's progress and the program, in which case we would obviously provide all necessary assistance.\n\nFor the administration of the program for this option the budget would be 20,000 ARB. This payment will also be divided into 6 months and will be sent in the proposal to Tally along with the payments to the delegates. In this way the DAO will have control over the administrator. \n\n### Disclaimer\n\nSEED Latam does not have any commercial relationship with Karma nor does it receive any payment from them for incorporating them into this proposal.\n\nThe only link between SEED Latam and Karma is that both want the success of the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\n# Overview\n\nProposal overview\n\n**Duration of the incentive system**\n* 6 month\n\n**Total Number of Delegates to Receive Incentives**\n\n* 50 delegates\n\n**Selection process**\n\n* **Voting Power**: >50K ARB, corresponding to 194 delegates. (Source:[ Arbitrum Delegates and Voting Power - Dune Analytics](https://dune.com/pandajackson42/arbitrum-delegates-and-voting-power)).\n* **Delegates to Receive Incentives**: 50.\n* **Budget Allocation**: 1,500,000 ARB (5,000 ARB per delegate per month).\n* **Historical Participation Rate (Tally)**: Over 25%\n\n*Eligible delegates must confirm their participation in the incentive system by posting a message on the forum.*\n\n## CONT IN FORUM POST",

        "body": "Full title: [Non-Constitutional] Transparency and Standardized Metrics for Orbit Chains  on growthepie.xyz Allowing Data-Driven Decision Making\n\nPlease review the proposal forum post for a full proposal description: https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arb-staking-unlock-arb-utility-and-align-governance/25084/1\n\n### Abstract\n\nWe want to increase the transparency into the Orbit stack by aggregating important metrics on a chain level so that users, builders, and DAO members can make better data-driven decisions, including what revenue an Orbit chain generates. This allows to plan much better, for example around an Orbit liquidity plan or other discussions around Orbit chains and their current/future support, or even retroactive programs (through better historic and comparable data points). \n\nThere is high likelyhood that the DAO will want to run an incentive program for Orbit Chains in the future. By having the data ready to go, we can avoid having a short-term program proposal which bootstraps data gathering. A 2% (low estimate) productivity increase on $50 million would have been $1 million. This proposal can likely pay for itself!\n\nIt will be in the form of a dedicated Arbitrum Orbit Stack page on [growthepie.xyz](http://growthepie.xyz/) having 20 chains listed with standardized metrics for each chain as well as an aggregated fundamental metrics view for the whole stack.\n\nBrief background: This proposal has been created initially for the Arbitrum GovHack Brussels and was selected as one of the finalists. This version is an updated version, especially making sure that this proposal is understood as \n-\ta start to have more usage analytics around Orbit chains\n-\tthat the future process of data collection and onboarding of chains is streamlined\n-\tconstantly iterated on to make the listings cheaper and more affordable/sustainable for upcoming (and potentially smaller, more niche) Orbit chains.\n\n### Motivation\n\nSo far, there is no go-to place that provides an overview of Arbitrum Orbit. Standardized metrics allow a better idea of the performance and outlook of each chain being part of the Arbitrum Orbit. This results in greater transparency for all chains regarding their activity and how the usage of one chain compares to another.\n\nUsers can use this information to gather a quick overview of the Orbit ecosystem. Builders can use the different metrics to better track adoption, and DAO members can make more data-driven decisions on future initiatives (e.g., Orbit retrospective funding based on onchain contribution to the DAO).\n\nAlso, visibility for the overall Arbitrum Orbit stack is increased, and the whole Ethereum ecosystem can see what is going on in the Arbitrum ecosystem - where to be and interact, build, or allocate funding towards. Additionally, for DAO members and delegates, revenue and cost metrics provide future insight into how the Orbit approach should be developed to make it profitable for the DAO as well (includes more transparency into how much Orbit chains are paying to Arbitrum One).\n\nThis proposal is meant as a start for a long-term partnership to provide listing of Orbit chains long-term and on a recurring basis on growthepie. After the listing of the first setup and 20 initial chains, we would like to follow up with another AIP to enable listing of the 21st+ chain.\n\n### Rationale\n\ngrowthepie is an entirely public goods funded analytics platform for Ethereum scaling solutions. The AIP aligns closely with Arbitrum community’s mission and guiding values. At growthepie, Ethereum alignment is at the core of our existence, ensuring that our efforts contribute to the broader Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nWe aim to enhance transparency, enabling data-driven decisions that are crucial for tracking outcomes and improving strategic decisions. All our code is open-source, allowing anyone to review and verify our metric logic. This openness fosters trust and ensures the integrity of our platform. We prioritize inclusivity by offering our platform and API completely free of charge, ensuring maximum accessibility for all users.\n\nOur user-focused design philosophy centers on the needs of our diverse audience, making data easy to digest and actionable for all users. We uphold the values of neutrality and openness as we believe in the power of data to increase transparency and objectivity. All information on our platform is freely available, reinforcing our commitment to these principles.\n\n### Specifications\n\ngrowthepie has proven to be a platform for people wanting to understand the overall health, activity, and usage across the Ethereum scaling solutions ecosystem. Arbitrum One was listed as one of the first 5 chains from the beginning. Since then, Arbitrum members have used the platform to compare Arbitrum One with other Layer 2s, and we have provided reliable data and visualizations for Arbitrum’s community. Marketing has also used our charts to provide data-driven insights into the ecosystem and how Arbitrum One is growing, giving it more credibility.\n\nBuilding on this, the Arbitrum Orbit should be given a dedicated place on growthepie with 20 chains listed in the beginning. This allows us to provide a mostly complete overview of the whole Arbitrum stack. This proposal is aimed at the start of a longer partnership. Hence, as part of this proposal, we will design and set up the initial pages and backend needed to onboard Orbit chains, aggregate fundamental metrics, and especially revenue metrics for each chain.\n\n**Which Orbit chains will be considered among the 20 chains as part of this proposal?**\nEvery chain that is above $1 million TVL (Total Value Locked) at time of the listing decision, will be eligible to be listed as part of this proposal. Every chain that is below at the start of the listing process will not be considered. In case a chain falls below $1 million TVL in the future (after the listing decision had been made), the chain will stay on growthepie, however. The chain will not be delisted and available data will be presented as long as no official announcement by the chain's team has been made that the chain will be shut down. \n\nEach Orbit chain – as Arbitrum One and any other chain listed on growthepie – will have their own set of metrics (in the categories activity, value locked, economics, and convenience) and their own single chain page. Additionally, each chain will appear on each fundamental metrics page for which the specific metric is available.\n\n**Stack view for an aggregated Arbitrum Orbit view**\nOn top of that, we will introduce a Stack view (new page) that provides a complete overview of the whole stack aggregated. This will be on a dedicated page which will enable users, builders, and DAO members solely interested in the Orbit to go to this place and learn more. See the prototype which includes:\n\n* Leading chart that aggregates Layer 2s and/or Layer 3s together showing growth over time\n* Table that lists all available Orbit chains on growthepie separated into Layer 2 and Layer 3\n* Fundamental metrics section with the aggregated view of all chains combined in the Arbitrum Orbit\n\nThis set of views will make it possible to easily get an overview and see the growth of the whole Orbit ecosystem but also to compare certain Orbit chains against each other (or against other Layer 2s from other ecosystems).    \n\n### Steps to Implement\n\nTimeframe starting from the date of DAO proposal approval and weeks/months add up to each other. Total duration ~ 5 months. Chain listing time is also dependent on potential collaboration with an indexing provider and their speed of chain indexing.\n \n![Screenshot 2024-08-08 at 4.28.38 PM.png](ipfs://bafkreigoncw5pkkpi3kyfevaiozgwiessp6hlfcf4ngdwnz6hqxryzmrdi)\n    \n\n### Overall Cost\n\nThe following cost are denominated in USD. The exact ARB amount will be determined closer to the onchain proposal date to reflect the US dollar ask. \n\n**Fix setup costs ($41,425.00 USD):**\n\n* Design and implement general platform UX adjustments (more chains mean restructuring of UI elements and different filter logic)\n* Designing and implementing frontend views: Orbit specific stack view, Single chain view (for each Orbit chain), Fundamentals view\n* Data infra setup (RPCs, database execution)\n* Metric aggregation & Logic: Activity (Transaction Count, Active Addresses – daily and monthly), Value locked (Stablecoin Market Cap, Total Value Locked), Economics (Revenue, Costs, Onchain Profit), plus Market Cap and Fully Diluted Valuation where applicable, Convenience metrics: Transaction Costs (median 1-day aggregation), DAO Contributions (how much back to ARB)\n\n**Initial chain listings (20 Orbit chains in total) and maintenance for 1 year ($168,750.00 USD):**\n\n* Integrate brand assets (icon, colors, etc.) for each chain\n* Pull raw transaction data and store in our database\n* Setup metric logic where applicable (e.g., bridge contracts for value locked, custom gas tokens, DA layer, settlement layer)\n* Daily aggregation of all relevant datapoints\n* Aggregated data / metrics available via API (for frontend and other data consumers)\n\n**Requirement:** Arbitrum Foundation provides indexed data. If not, an additional cost for indexing will be added ($3,750.00 USD per chain)\n\n**Recurring costs also cover:**\n\n* Hosting frontend\n* Maintenance backend / data pipelines\n* Regular posts on social media about interesting developments (from data perspective)\n\n**Total Costs: $210,175.00 USD**",
