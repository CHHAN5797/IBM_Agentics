        "body": "---\n\ntitle: [ARFC] Aave Liquidity Committee Funding Phase V\nauthor: @karpatkey_TokenLogic\ncreated: 2024-12-03\n\n---\n\n# Summary\n\nThis publication presents the Aave Liquidity Committee (ALC) Phase V request. \n\n# Phase IV Update\n\nBuoyant market conditions in November drove strong demand for stablecoin debt that resulted in the composition of DEX liquidity pools being increasingly concentrated in GHO, and outflows from the the GSMs. Three small Borrow Rate increases were implemented with minimal effect and ultimately GHO's peg began showing signs of stress from November 12th up until the 1st December.\n\nFrom late October to early November, GHO's debt continued to expand leading to a noticeable shift in the composition of the Balancer 3pool liquidity pool in favour of GHO. A few days later, the GSMs started experiencing outflows resulting in GHO being burnt and USDC plus USDT reserves being distributing.\n\nNote: The composition of the Balancer 3pool started shifting on October 28th, prior to the GSM experiencing outflows on the 3rd November and eight days before the Curve NP Pool's composition began favouring GHO. This is due to the high amp in the 3pool and the current the fees configuration on the GSMs. \n\n![Screenshot 2024-12-01 at 13.29.01](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HJehNJcQkg.png)\nSource: https://aave.tokenlogic.xyz/liquidity-pools\n\nBetween the 4th to 10th November, ~16M units of GHO were burned and all but small amount of the 8M units of USDC and 8M units of USDT remain in the GSM.\n\n![Screenshot 2024-12-01 at 12.43.16](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/r1Vl9CFXkl.png)\nSource: https://aave.tokenlogic.xyz/gho-stability-module\n\nThree Borrow Rate amendments were pushed by the GHO Stewards, 50bps on 7th November, 75bps on 12th November and 50bps on the 18th November. All three Borrow Rate increases were ineffective and demand from prevailing market conditions proving more influential with ETH trading from 2,720 USD on the 7th November to 3,204 USD on the 18th November.\n\nON the 11th November, DEX pools heavily nominated in GHO and the GSMs depleted, GHO's spot price began to come under pressure. On the 12th November, the GHO Stewards increased the Borrow Rate for a second time and reduced the Borrow Cap to prevent new GHO from being borrowed.\n\nOver the next few days, GHO was redeemed from Maverick and borrowed on Fluid, before being swapped to other assets which resulted in downwards pressure on the weak peg.\n\n![image](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ByK9d0Ymke.png)\nSource: https://aave.tokenlogic.xyz/gho\n\nThe third Borrow Rate increase, 50 bps on the 18th November, had minimal affect and on the 20th November, the GHO Stewards increased the Borrow Rate by 300bps to recover the peg. \n\nThe 300bps increase was successful with 12.3M units of GHO being repaid. Soon afterwards, general stablecoin borrow rates increased across Aave v3 and this resulted in users borrowing GHO causing the peg to deteriorate. \n\n![Screenshot 2024-12-01 at 12.47.14](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BJbkjAYm1l.png)\n\nA second 350bps Borrow Rate was implemented resulting in 14.5M units of GHO debt being repaid and resulted in GHO trading 0.999 USD.\n\n![Screenshot 2024-12-01 at 13.05.53](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rJwrk19Q1x.png)\nSource: https://aave.tokenlogic.xyz/borrow-rate\n\nThe Paraswap v6 integrating on the main frontend facilitated swaps into GHO helping recover the peg as users migrated away from GHO debt. The ability to change between to and from GHO debt on the frontend has proven to be both a critical growth and peg stability tool. \n\n## Ethereum\n\n### DEX Liquidity\n\nDuring Phase IV, buoyant market conditions resulted in GHO's peg to experiencing more volatility than the prior reporting period. \n\nThe returns from a 5M GHO to USDC swap is shown below and highlights the low quoted price impact of performing the swap. The primarily consideration in the image below is the spot pricing of GHO being 0.9980.\n\n![Screenshot 2024-12-01 at 13.48.58](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/S1jLK1cm1x.png)\nSource: https://swap.defillama.com\n\nOverall, AUM in G=DEX liquidity pools is $37M with around half, or 19.4M units, being nominated in GHO.\n\n![Screenshot 2024-12-01 at 14.39.52](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/S1dHBxcX1x.png)\nSource: https://aave.tokenlogic.xyz/liquidity-pools\n\n![Screenshot 2024-12-01 at 14.40.44](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rysuBg9mJx.png)\nSource: https://aave.tokenlogic.xyz/liquidity-pools\n\nThe recent reduction in GHO within DEX liquidity pool correlates with GHO's circulating supply contracting due to users repaying GHO debt in response to the recent 350bps Borrow Rate increase.\n\nThe [wBTC/GHO/wstETH](https://curve.fi/#/ethereum/pools/factory-tricrypto-31/deposit) Tricrypto Pool and [GHO/wstETH](https://balancer.fi/pools/ethereum/v2/0x7d98f308db99fdd04bbf4217a4be8809f38faa6400020000000000000000059b) 80/20 Weight Pool on Curve and Balancer respectively have been consolidated into [cbBTC/GHO/wETH](https://curve.fi/#/ethereum/pools/factory-tricrypto-47/deposit) on Curve. The consolidation of two pools into a single pool is expected to result in a cost saving to the ALC. The timing of this was dictated by the largest LP in the 80/20 pool developing the ability to hedge both BTC and ETH price exposure. \n\n### Funding Rates\n\nPerp funding rates have increased significantly over recent weeks making providing liquidity in DEX pools less attractive. With asset prices generally trending higher, the GHO liquidity rewards have been able to continue offering a competitive yield. However, sustaining the amount of the liquidity is resulting in elevated spending levels. \n\n### InstadApp - Fluid Integration\n\nLaunching GHO on InstadApp's Fluid for lending has proven successful with over 12M of GHO deposited. The largest LP in this pool has a collateral and a GHO debt position on Aave.\n\n![Screenshot 2024-12-01 at 16.12.41](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HJiboWcXkg.png)\n\nAhead of launching GHO as Smart Collateral and Smart Debt on Fluid, the ALC coordinated with GHO Stewards to recover the peg via second large Borrow Rate increase. The ALC views the Smart Collateral and Smart Debt features as beneficial for supporting swaps and providing deeper liquidity. \n\n### PYUSD/GHO Liquidity\n\nWith funding received, members of the ALC are actively working with various fund managers to source the GHO/PYUSD liquidity. Seeding this 8M of liquidity when GHO is at peg will help the ALC to retain GHO's peg. At the time of writing, the ALC expects the 8M of PYUSD/GHO liquidity to be seeded week starting 1st December 2024. \n\n<insert image of gyroscope profile here>\n\n### Royco\n\nWith the objective of stimulating demand for GHO in challenging market conditions, the ALC created and funded Quest on Royco to reward users for swapping USDC to GHO and staking the GHO for 30 days before being able to call the cool down function.\n\nThe Quest is targeting 5M of USDC being swapped to GHO to help rebalance the composition of the DEX liquidity pools.\n\n## Arbitrum\n\nGHO's growth on Arbitrum continues to be slow. \n\nIn collaboration with Paxos, the wUSDL/GHO pool on Balancer has been funded and the ALC is working with Paxos to progress this liquidity from a ComposableStable pool type on Balancer v2 to v3 and ideally into a Concentrated liquidity pool type.\n\n![Screenshot 2024-12-01 at 16.39.01](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SJIVZMcXyx.png)\n\nGHO was proposed and approved as liquidity on Synthetix v3 and recently, the ALC received feedback for GHO to be added as both Liquidity and Margin on Synthetixs. A Pull Request is currently with the Synthetixs team for review to support onboarding GHO as Liquidity and Margin. \n\nGHO is expected to be listed on Synthetix v3 in the near future and are liaising with several funds regarding the prospect of providing liquidity to kick start the integration. \n\n# Phase V Lookahead\n\n## Ethereum\n\nIn response to recent peg volatility, the primary focus of the ALC is to retain the peg and create deep liquidity supportive of facilitating large swaps with minimal price impact.\n\n### Balancer v3\n\nEarly December Balancer v3 will launch without any gauges and with some incentives to attract liquidity. Several major GHO liquidity provider are yet to have had the opportunity to review Balancer v3's code base or audits. As a result, we expect the migration to v3 to take some time and may not be pursued until sometime in the new year when all the pools are configured with gauges via governance.\n\n### GHO on Aave Prime\n\nGHO is expected to be launched on the Prime instance of Aave v3 with initial seed liquidity provided by the DAO. The sUSDe eMode is expected to create strong demand for stablecoins and GHO alike. The initial seed liquidity is hopefully sufficient enough to entice users to borrow GHO. With adequate GHO debt in the reserve, this should create a high native yield for GHO deposits.\n\nThe introduction of dedicated Merit program may be used to help attract deposits.\n\n### Royco Quests\n\nPending the results of the initial Royco Quest, the ALC may continue to use Royco as a means of stimulating demand for GHO and promoting the adoption of GHO in other protocols. \n\nEncouraging GHO Smart Collateral and Smart Debt on Fluid and deposits into Gearbox when Pendle PTs are added remain near term opportunities for the ALC to consider. \n\n## Arbitrum\n\nWith the GHO intended for Arbitrum used for the INST purchase, the ALC still advocates for additional liquidity to be provided into Aave v3 to support the adoption of GHO on Arbitrum. This is most likely to be achieved with a new facilitator on Ethereum that leads to GHO being minted, bridged and deposited into Aave v3.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, in the near future, we expect GHO to be listed on Synthetixs v3 as a deposit asset that earn yields and also as margin. Do note, any un-utilised liquidity is deposited into Aave v3 to earn yield.\n\nA USDe/aGHO ECLP was launched with x30 Sats and has achieved minimal inflows despite ample rewards. The ALC is likely to reduce spend on this pool and reprioritise this portion of the budget.\n\nThe ALC is continuing to explore other potential integrations for GHO on Arbitrum with a high frequency oracle being developed by Chainlink to enable new integrations that haven't been technically possible this far.\n\n## Base and Avalanche \n\nPhase V will oversee the deployment of GHO on Base and Avalanche, marking the first multi-chain expansion since GHO was successful launch on Arbitrum. These integrations aim to extend GHO’s adoption and utility to new ecosystems.\n\naToken GSMs are expected to help maintain the peg on each respectively network. Leveraging existing relationships, the ALC intends to promote DEX liquidity at launch and a Synthetix integration on Base soon after launch. \n\n## Performance Metrics\n\nThe below details some high-level GHO metrics:\n\n| Description | Ethereum Value | Arbitrum Value |Avalanche Value | Base Value |\n| --------  | :--------:  | :--------:  | :--------:  | :--------:  |\n| TVL DEX Liquidity Pools | 50M | 20M | 20M | 20M |\n| TVL Utility Liquidity Pools (Excl. stkGHO)  | 15M  | 7.5M | 7.5M | 7.5M|\n| DEX Liquidity Composition | < 50% GHO (< 33% for 3pools)  | < 50% GHO (< 33% for 3pools)  | < 50% GHO  (< 33% for 3pools) | < 50% GHO  (< 33% for 3pools) | \n| Swap Price Impact $5M Swap (GHO to USDC) | < 0.10%  | < 0.25%  | < 0.25%  | < 0.25%  |\n| Annualised Peg Volatility | < 5.00%  | < 5.00%  |< 5.00%  |< 5.00%  |\n| Price level for >90% time | $0.995  | $0.995 | $0.995 | $0.995 |\n\nPlease note, each of the above targets has external dependencies beyond the control of the ALC. The above table serves as a North Star for the ALC to strive towards over the next three months. Having measurable targets provides a clear direction and goal to achieve.\n\n# Specification\n\nSwap the following assets to GHO and deposit into the Prime instance on Ethereum.\n\n| Ethereum         | \n| :--------------: | \n| aEthUSDT (1.25M) |\n| aEthUSDC (1.25M) | \n\nCreate an Allowance allowaing the ALC to withdraw GHO from the Prime instance for a total of 2,000,000 GHO.\n\nALC Ethereum SAFE: `0xA1c93D2687f7014Aaf588c764E3Ce80aF016229b`\n\n# Disclosure\n\nTokenLogic and karpatkey receive no payment for this proposal. \n\n# Next Steps\n\n1.

        "body": "---\n### [TEMP CHECK] AAVEnomics update\n### Author: ACI\n###  Date: 2024-07-25\n---\n### Simple Summary:\n\nThis proposal seeks governance feedback and consensus on leveraging the Safety Module Umbrella update to create a clear path and roadmap related to the protocol \"fee switch\", defined as updated \"AAVEnomics\".\n\n## Motivation\n\n### Before we start\n\nThis proposal leverages the https://governance.aave.com/t/bgd-aave-safety-module-umbrella/18366 proposal, it is strongly advised to read it before diving into the current proposal.\nThe current proposal has been peer-reviewed by Aave service providers and active Aave DAO community representatives & delegates.\n\n### Introduction\n\nThe Aave protocol is the clear market leader in the liquidity vertical and is focused on expanding in both the stablecoin and bridging verticals. The protocol's TVL and net profit growth have largely outpaced market conditions thanks to the coordinated efforts of service providers appointed by DAO governance.\nThe Aave protocol is also the clear leader on every network Aave has deployed to, and when given a choice, DeFi users leverage Aave over alternatives.\nThis has allowed the Aave DAO not only to \"cover its own bills\" but also has built [a large treasury of ETH and stablecoins](https://aave.tokenlogic.xyz/treasury).\n\n \n![treasury.jpeg](ipfs://bafkreihrskqratcejxrmldlzopv4lj42esks3cgel2kugnd3ijzlt4leui)\n    \n\nAdditionally, during the past couple of quarters, the DAO explored revenue sharing with the Merit program, which is essentially a redistribution of the protocol's net stablecoin excess revenue to the GHO minters and stakers to support aligned behaviors and the growth of GHO. Alongside Merit, the Ahab program, which is funded by protocol net ETH & ETH-correlated assets, is mobilized to attract strategic liquidity in Aave markets, supporting protocol growth in the main & new markets.\n\nWith the ACI, we consider the DAO now ready to explore a further step in the protocol's maturity and would like to submit for governance consideration a clear path for protocol net excess revenue redistribution to the key actors of the Aave ecosystem, creating new positive dynamics and novel synergies within the industry.\n\nThis journey is designed in several incremental steps. This proposal seeks feedback on the journey as a whole as a “TEMP CHECK” and approval to begin the first step via a potential “ARFC”.\n\nTo ensure the DAO's long-term sustainability, new steps will be escalated when the protocol reaches specific growth and net excess revenue milestones.\n\n## Umbrella: A Proposed Safety Module Paradigm Shift\n\nThe Safety Module is a crucial line of defense for the Aave protocol. In case of a shortfall event, and if liquidators do not complete their tasks, the Safety Module is designed to assume the excess debt on behalf of users to avoid or at least mitigate bad debt events.\n\nFortunately, the Safety Module has never been needed for the Aave protocol. The few excess debt events in Aave protocol history have been addressed by governance through the mobilization of \"cash\" DAO treasury funds.\n\nHowever, the current model is inefficient as it relies on secondary liquidity to liquidate Safety Module assets to obtain excess debt assets and clear debt.\n\nWith both GHO and StkAAVE, the primary issue with the Safety Module is that the current $424M hosted in the Safety Module cannot effectively clear $424M of excess debt. This is because:\n\n1. The value of AAVE would be negatively impacted due to slippage.\n2. The GHO peg is unlikely to withstand the mobilization of almost two-thirds of its current supply.\n\nWhile it is highly improbable to encounter an excess debt event of this magnitude (precedent was less than 1% of this amount), the entire model has room for optimization.\n\nTherefore, Umbrella proposes:\n\n1. Segregation of coverage\n2. Elimination of reliance on secondary liquidity\n\nFrom now on, the Safety Module activation should focus on slippage-free debt burn coverage.\n\nUmbrella allows the deployment of aTokens Safety Modules that are more cost efficient and provides better protection to Aave users; This proposal seeks approval on a multi-step journey toward Umbrella Activation and redefines the Role & benefits of the AAVE assets & tokenomics in the Aave ecosystem.\n\n## Umbrella Coverage Adoption Journey\n\nAs an initial and immediate step:\n\nWe propose segregating StkGHO and StkAAVE Safety Module coverages to distinguish protections and improve StkGHO Safety Module efficiency, which would protect the GHO stablecoin.\n\nWith this upgrade, the StkGHO Safety Module is meant to only protect users from GHO debt and is mobilized to clear GHO excess debt only.\n\nGHO is a young stablecoin with limited secondary liquidity. In the current stage of GHO maturity, mobilizing GHO to protect other assets' debt will mean the death of the GHO peg and trust in GHO for limited resources gained.\n\nHowever, in the context of GHO debt protection only, StkGHO is a perfect tool. In case of a shortfall event, GHO can be seized in the Safety Module and used to clear excess debt by burning GHO. This action is absolutely slippage-free and will not impact the GHO peg.\n\nSafety Module users will suffer a below 1 StkGHO <> GHO exchange rate, but it's a risk they willingly accepted by staking.\n\nExample: If there's 100M GHO in the Safety Module and the protocol suffers a $3M excess debt GHO shortfall event, via an AIP, 3M GHO will be seized from the Safety Module to clear the debt. As a result, the StkGHO/GHO exchange rate will drop to 0.97, leading to a socialized net haircut of 3% for all Safety Module stakers (around 6 weeks of the current reward rate).\n\nThis paradigm shift will make GHO the safest and most trustworthy stablecoin in the ecosystem with currently both an average overcollateralization ratio of 2.5 and ~65% of the supply that can be mobilized to clear any form of excess debt without impacting the GHO peg.\n\nThis will de facto make Ethereum StkGHO the first Safety Module adopting the Umbrella standard.\n\nThese changes come at the cost of temporarily reduced overall V3 protection, but as discussed earlier, GHO is not mature enough to be a suitable asset to protect other debts than GHO at this moment. The reduced protection will be covered by the introduction of new Safety Modules in further steps.\n\nWe propose adopting the following:\n\n### Umbrella coverage adoption Journey doctrine:\n\n1. The Legacy Safety Module coverage is set to all live networks Aave V3 debt until replaced.\n2. The Legacy StkGHO SM protects GHO debt exclusively. This safety module becomes the prime candidate for becoming the first Umbrella safety module instance via upgrade.\n3. The Umbrella Ethereum Safety Modules will not automatically cover Aave V3 deployments; coverage must be opt-in by governance vote.\n4. Mid-term: segregate risk further by deploying network-specific Umbrella Safety Modules financed by protocol \"local\" net excess revenue.\n\n\n### StkGHO Migration and upgrade Journey\n\nGHO is growing and is meant to be a profitable product of the Aave protocol. At ~150/175M GHO, GHO is expected to be net profitable for the protocol, with revenue outpacing system subsidies.\n\nCurrently, GHO has a dual reward system with rewards in AAVE sourced from the ecosystem reserve and Merit airdrops sourced from protocol net profits.\n\nWe propose, in resonance with previous governance decisions, to slowly cut rewards of the StkGHO safety module in favor of a potential Umbrella StkGHO safety module.\n\nThe Merit programs yielded great results in terms of growth, peg preservation, and user behavior optimization. We propose to maintain the Merit program in its current form.\n\nThis will keep a dual reward system for StkGHO: a \"base yield\" paid continuously in GHO to stakers and an \"Airdrop\" yield via Merit that can be optimized to reward more users with net positive behavior for the protocol, maintaining \"boosts\" of most wanted behavior but ensuring a sustainable \"base yield\" for this part of the Safety Module. Both of these rewards are financed by Aave protocol net revenue.\n\nIn practical terms, The Legacy GHO safety module has whitelisted AAVE emissions until Oct 2024 and benefit from Merit, we propose to slowly incentivize user migration to the Umbrella stkGHO by letting the AAVE distribution slowly expire and changing the Merit reward focus on Umbrella on the next Merit round post-publication.\n\nThis will slightly increase cost and efficiency by having a few weeks off incentives on both StkGHO safety module but gains on users experience allowing them to migrate at their own pace justifies it.\n\n## A new role for Aave beyond the Legacy Safety module, AAVENomics update.\n\nAAVE is the center of gravity of the Aave protocol. It is the governance asset of the DAO, allowing true control and ownership of the Aave protocol to a degree not achieved in any other protocol in our industry. But as a Safety Module asset, it's simply not efficient enough. AAVE is not a debt token in the Aave protocol and is not as liquid as ETH and major stablecoins.\n\n### End the \"Seize and Sell\" Doctrine\n\nThe \"seize and sell\" doctrine is dangerous as it's inefficient due to slippage, creates the need to subsidize strong secondary liquidity (StkBPT Safety Module), and causes great price pressure on the asset in case of mobilizing the Safety Module. This reduces the cost of acquiring a large amount of AAVE and taking effective control and ownership of the protocol. With historically 15-30% of the Aave supply in the Safety Module and considering the average governance participation, this risk must be seriously considered.\n\nAdditionally, the relatively low maximum slashing of 30% of the AAVE Safety Module means the protocol is allocating funds that are mostly not even mobilizable to protect the protocol.\n\nLastly, the AAVE Safety Module is not sustainable as it is subsidized by the ecosystem reserve that will eventually run out of funds.\n\nWe propose the AAVE Safety Module to not be included in the Umbrella update, StkAAVE will evolve into a staking role acting as a liquidity sink and a way to collect rewards generated from the protocol revenue and other protocol benefits.\n\n### StkBPT Redefinition\n\nThe Aave DAO has spent large amounts of resources incentivizing AAVE's secondary liquidity to maintain the current Safety Module paradigm.\n\nWhile the secondary liquidity of AAVE is important, it should not be a focus of the Safety Module.\n\nThe DAO earned experience with secondary liquidity management with the Aave Liquidity Committee (ALC) program, yielding great results on GHO peg and growth.\n\nWe propose not including StkBPT from the Umbrella Safety Modules and appoint the ALC to manage AAVE secondary liquidity. We also propose the introduction of a \"Buy & Distribute\" program funded by the protocol's excess revenue, With a budget defined by Aave Finance service providers and management by the ALC.\n\nThe ALC and Aave Finance service providers will continue their journey of decentralization and automatization of these processes, contributing to a future with the human element as removed as possible from these actions.\n\nThis will increase the Safety Module's budget efficiency, make the subsidy of secondary liquidity sustainable, and allow more granular liquidity management. It is expected to optimize the funds needed to maintain the expected outcome.\n\nIn this new system, Liquidity will still be incentivized, but we expect a large optimization in the cost and management of this secondary liquidity.\n\n### Introduction of Anti-GHO\n\nCreating a GHO borrow rate discount was a good idea to align AAVE holders and GHO minters, but the discount mechanism is not efficient in terms of protocol accounting and can be optimized.\n\nWe propose, based on discussions with several service providers, particularly Bgd Labs, the removal of the GHO borrow rate discount and the introduction of a new “anti-GHO” token generated by StkAAVE holders minting GHO.\n\nThe users linearly accumulate anti-GHO, which is claimable at the user's will. Anti-GHO generation is proportionate to the interest accumulated by all GHO borrowers.\n\nAnti-GHO is a non-transferable ERC-20 linked to a couple of special-purpose GHO facilitators that can be used in two ways:\n\n1. Burn Anti-gho to mint GHO used to repay their own GHO debt \"for free.\"\n \n![burn anti gho mint.png](ipfs://bafkreifvldjg2ivjc3x7li4hmv4v4bde5xii6p6vwnlm6cdh62zgtlwv5m)\n    \n\n2. Mint GHO to be deposited on the user’s behalf in the GHO Safety Module and distribute StkGHO to the user.\n\n \n![holders stkaave.jpeg](ipfs://bafkreibylsxdbvqvwllrvmkd3x6b7e6dqcvuo6tnbevzz5g7jppb2hjp7a)\n    \n\n\nBoth special-purpose facilitators' \"debt\" will be regularly \"cleared\" by mobilizing GHO from the Aave Collector via Aave treasury regular AIPs to repay, ensuring no long-term unbacked GHO in the protocol.\n\nThis new system is more efficient, increases the alignment of AAVE stakers with GHO borrowers, and officially introduces revenue sharing of part of the Aave protocol revenue to some AAVE stakers, acting as the initial step of a more ambitious excess revenue-sharing strategy.\n\n### Closing the LEND chapter\n\nNearly 4 Years ago, After the launch of Aave V1, the Aave protocol proposed the initial AAVEnomics migrating the legacy asset LEND into the current AAVE token.\nAfter a significant amount of time passed and witnessing the lack of activity of the legacy asset, we take this proposal as an opportunity to close the LEND chapter.\n\nWe consider that 4 years and the amount of time that will pass for these proposals, publications, approvals, implementations, and execution to offer ample and fair notice to legacy users to migrate to AAVE, we propose to deactivate the legacy migrator contract and transfer the remaining balance to the Ecosystem reserve to be mobilized for Aave Stakers and protocol growth.\n\n## Activate Umbrella Atokens Safety Module, initiate “Buy and Distribute” AAVENomics\n\nThe Aave protocol is seen as the industry standard in terms of resilience and safety, making Safety Modules of Aave a popular option for protecting protocol users despite the risks.\n\nAdditionally, ~80% of the Aave protocol users deposit in the protocol but do not have Aave debt. Their use case of the protocol is to seek yield on liquidity provided. These users consider the Aave protocol safe enough to keep their assets inside the protocol contracts for the long term.\n\nThe paradigm shift to \"seize and burn\" instead of the current \"seize and sell\" increases the Safety Module efficiency significantly. The natural progression of this strategy is to mobilize users who consider the Aave protocol safe enough to hold their assets and do not seek to create debt to consider renouncing their Safety Module protection, their borrowing power and short-term aToken liquidity (cooldown period) in exchange for extra yield.\n\nThis is done by adding a Atoken category to the Umbrella Safety Module. In case of a shortfall event, these tokens are seized and used to burn debt, just as the StkGHO Umbrella Safety Module will function.\n\nMost of the Aave protocol debt is in wETH and stablecoins.\n\nTherefore, we are gathering feedback on the initiation of Umbrella Atoken Safety Modules with awETH and aUSDC.\n\nThis allows for covering most of the debt in the protocol if these assets need to be mobilized.\nBecause debt can be repaid in aTokens in Aave V3, the available secondary liquidity of these aTokens is not relevant in excess debt clearing.\n\nTo cover debt labeled in other assets, USDC and ETH are the most liquid assets in the ecosystem, making slippage considerations a low issue, especially with a focused scope of Safety Module coverage introduced earlier.\n\naTokens Safety Modules are proposed to be primarily rewarded in their respective aTokens, financed by their respective Reserve Factor collection on their assets and correlated assets.\n\nUmbrella multi-reward support allows for more mid-term synergies for “Re-Staking”, which will be explored further in this TEMP CHECK.\n\nDetails and budgets of these Umbrella Atokens Safety modules should be discussed at the ARFC stage with feedback from both Risk & Finance teams.\n\nWe’re confident this will allow a factually superior coverage of the Aave V3 protocol at a fraction of the current costs.\n\n### Activate a \"Buy & Distribute\" Program\n\nWith the new efficient Umbrella safety modules, it is expected that the protocol revenue surplus will increase. With sustainability reached milestones, this net excess revenue should be mobilized and redirected to token stakers currently funded via the ecosystem rewards contract.\n\nIn terms of rewards, the ecosystem rewards will eventually run out of funds. That being said, we propose that StkAAVE remains compensated in AAVE tokens as stakers are already aligned with the asset. To achieve this, a \"Buy & Distribute\" program is introduced to acquire AAVE assets on secondary markets from protocol revenue and distribute them to the ecosystem reserve. This upgrades the current AAVE safety module in a new “Staking Module”, not part of Umbrella.\n\nThere's little to no difference in user experience from the current situation, but in terms of protocol sustainability, it's a paradigm shift. This new system also introduces a constant demand side for the AAVE asset on secondary markets.\n\nIt is proposed that this program be funded with the net excess revenue of the protocol.\n\nRewards rates will be defined according to protocol net excess revenue and will reflect the actual financial results of the protocols, with periods of higher rewards to potential periods with zero yield.\n\nWe propose that the Aave Finance service providers manage the \"Buy & Distribute\" program via treasury AIPs to increase efficiency in the short term. We believe this process also needs to be part of the Journey of decentralization, and we expect the Aave Finance service providers to contribute to a future with the human element as removed as possible from this program \n\nFor an easier understanding of the new AAVEnomics vision, please consider the following visual representation:\n\n \n![visual representation.jpeg](ipfs://bafybeigfqm7tms5yc2homzrgar6ikt6bbplco4cejmqg5i7jqngalmm2eq)\n    \n\n## “Re-Staking” Umbrella Beyond Aave\n\nAave's Safety track record speaks for itself; while Aave had several excess debt events, the DAO never had to mobilize the legacy Safety module. With the Umbrella upgrade, we expect the efficient coverage to increase significantly compared to the current situation, from a theoretical $100m to likely billions of mid-terms.\n\nThe Aave DAO can mobilize and monetize this coverage beyond the Aave protocol. The Aave DAO service providers are risk experts who can give valuable coverage recommendations to the Aave governance.\n\nThe Umbrella multi-token incentives controller allows for rewards in several tokens, and we believe this cost-efficient coverage of already existing significant liquidity will be of high interest for third-party protocols and networks, as shown by the high interest of the “Restaking” DeFi vertical.\n\nWhile the journey to maturity on this vertical is still long, the ACI wanted to share this mid-term vision to the community of a potential new journey for protocol revenue and Umbrella Stakers Yield.\n\n## Specification\n\n### Milestones and Trigger Conditions\n\nWhile the Aave protocol's net excess revenues are at an all-time high, it would be reckless to implement significant new budget spending without considering the protocol's long-term sustainability.\nFrom a user experience perspective, a too-ambitious distribution schedule being forced to halt due to more adverse revenue collection conditions will lead to massive and unwanted frustration.\nThe Aave DAO has always been a conservative actor and has always prioritized long-term sustainability over short-term yield.\n\nWe suggest considering the following elements as key data points to execute changes in Safety Modules in steps:\n\n- Aave Collector net holdings\n- Service providers' recurring budget\n- Merit and ALC program recurring budgets\n- GHO supply\n- GHO 30-day average revenue\n- Protocol 30-day average revenue\n\nThe ACI Proposes this vision to be implemented in 3 differents ARFCs to be sequentially proposed alongside reaching set milestones, we welcome governance feedback on this implementation Journey.\n\n## Initial ARFC Doctrine Adoption and Deployment of First Umbrella Safety Module: StkGHO\n\nAdoption of the Following Doctrine:\n\n1.

Currently, the SM is overly concentrated in AAVE via direct AAVE staking and ABPT staking which is a Balancer v1 80/20 AAVE/wETH liquidity token.\n\nThis publication seeks to explore the community's appetite to diversify the SM asset base and vary the portion of users' funds which can be auctioned in the event of a shortfall. Currently, 30% of user deposits are at risk when depositing into the SM.\n\n# Motivation\n\n@bgdlabs is currently proposing to upgrade the [SM architecture](https://governance.aave.com/t/bgd-aave-safety-module-v1-5/12148) to support the launch of GHO, by enabling stkAAVE holders to access cheaper GHO borrowing rates. Further to this, Llama has kick started the conversation around migrating AAVE liquidity from Balancer v1 to v2 in this [forum post](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-safety-module-update-part-i-migrate-aave-weth-balancer-v1-pool-to-balancer-v2/12748).\n\nSeveral comments relating to the AAVE concentration and auction mechanism have been made on the forum which can be found [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/size-x-aave-auction-safety-module/11984), [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/discussion-safety-module/12029) and [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-extend-safety-module-coverage-to-polygon-v3/11876/4).\n\nThis publication presents three distinct categories for inclusion in the SM.\n\n* Single Asset\n* Volatile Asset Liquidity Positions\n* Stable Asset Liquidity Positions\n\nThe net change to the existing implementation is the introduction of a third category, Stable Asset Liquidity Positions. The existing AAVE and ABPT represent Single Asset and Volatile Asset Liquidity Positions.\n\nAlthough any Liquidity Provider (LP) position can be included, G-Uni, crvLP, BPT etc… This publication will initially focus on the overarching concept and how BPTs could be integrated.\n\nBPTs were selected due to Aave’s relationship with Balancer DAO and the veBAL holding which the community may elect to utilize here. It should be stressed, Aave DAO will elect which assets are to be included and the varying levels of slashing for each category.\n\nAssets considered for inclusion should have minimal counterparty risk and display great on-chain liquidity amongst other considerations such as price correlation with Aave Protocol’s TVL during varying market conditions.\n\nLlama proposes three initial asset categories to be created within the SM.\n\nThe slashing parameters update aims to reduce the price impact on the AAVE token in the case of a shortfall event. We propose adding different levels of slashing to each category, as follows:\n\n## Single Assets\n\nThe current single asset, with 30% slashing, is AAVE. This proposal introduces other assets to this category with the goal of reducing the concentration of AAVE inside the insurance fund.\n\nPossible assets for consideration inside the SM Single Asset Category include, not limited to:\n\n* AAVE\n* ETH and/or wstETH\n\nIf the community elects with the introduction of additional assets other than AAVE, then each asset could be considered individually. This publication retains the 30% slashing feature for Single Asset.\n\nThe inclusion of wstETH may attract additional incentives from Lido DAO, therefore Llama prefers having the ability to distribute multiple rewards types with external teams able to distribute their own token. Something similar to the Emission Admin role on Aave v3 will suffice.\n\nLlama preference is for wstETH over wETH due to improved capital efficiency by enabling users to earn an overall higher APY from being a SM depositor. wstETH has become a major trading pairing token on Balancer and it has ample liquidity across various pools to route swaps through. Additionally, the stETH-ETH discount has reduced significantly (0.9938:1 for 100K ETH sold, which also demonstrates [very deep liquidity](https://swap.defillama.com/?chain=ethereum&from=0xae7ab96520de3a18e5e111b5eaab095312d7fe84&to=0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000).\n\nLlama would also encourage Lido DAO to indicate any potential support for this type of integration between the two protocols as inclusion in the SM would act to help retain or grow wstETH adoption via the creation of a unique use case for wstETH relative to other LSTs.\n\nMax slashing proposed: 30% retained for single assets.\n\nInitial assets proposed: AAVE / ETH and/or stETH\n\n## Risks Considerations\n\nIf LSTs (such as wstETH) are included in the SM, it creates a price divergence risk which, if sustained, can reduce the cover in the SM and create an unfair distribution of the rewards between ETH & wstETH. Post redemption the main risk consideration for LSTs becomes counterparty risk which if it materialized would lead to a significant discount to the LST price in ETH terms.\n\n* To limit the de-peg risk, the SM could stop incentivizing below a defined ratio, so the total value would then be deduced from the total cover value. This acts to mitigate counterparty risk without requiring governance intervention.\n\nBased upon technical feedback relating to the ease of implementation, Llama may revise this section of the publication.\n\n## Volatile Liquidity Provider Tokens\n\nIn addition to the replacement pool for the 80/20 AAVE/wETH pool on Balancer v1, to be determined by an earlier publication. This publication presents two other pools of strategic importance to Aave DAO for inclusion in the SM.\n\nThis publication presents the prospect of creating an 80/20 GHO/wETH (or wstETH) which offers less impermanent loss than a 50/50 pool whilst also providing very deep liquidity for risk off events which see spikes in stable coin swap volumes which can often lead to stable coins trading above $1.\n\nFor the following categories, up to 75% of the current budget could be allocated.\n\nMax slashing proposed 45% for volatile BPTs\n\nInitial volatile BPTs proposed: B-80AAVE-20wstETH (or Part I proposal results) & B-80GHO-20WETH\n\nEven if not yet created, this is probably the most interesting addition to this category as the trading volume of this pool will generate an important yield for LPs. The second pool could also be converted into a [Balancer Core Pool](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-19-incentivize-core-pools-l2-usage/3329) by replacing ETH by IBTs as described in Part I.\n\n## Stable Liquidity Provider Tokens\n\nIn this third category, this publication presents an initial pool consisting of the Balancer [3pool](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0x79c58f70905f734641735bc61e45c19dd9ad60bc0000000000000000000004e7) and GHO. Like other categories, in the future, additional assets can be added. If the community elects to launch BB-A-USD/GHO on Balancer or a stable coin pool on Curve, then this section can pivot to include the Curve pool.\n\nMax slashing proposed: 60% for stable\n\nInitial Stable BPT proposed: B-3Pool/GHO\n\nThis pool introduces a stable asset to the SM design and generates a significant amount of the coverage as 60% of the TVL can be slashed with very low price impact across the broader ecosystem. This is especially the case if something like Cowswap’s auction mechanism was to feature in the new SM auction mechanism.\n\nBy integrating a GHO pair to the SM, Aave is essentially helping bootstrapping GHO adoptions through incentivised liquidity. Aave will also earn revenue from the GHO borrowing rate.\n\nIf the community elects to proceed with 3CRV/GHO, then this would increase the SM smart contract surface area through diversifying exposure concentration away from Balancer to include Cuve Finance and potentially Convex Finance risk as well.\n\nThere is also the option of adding additional pools which could include GHO, MAI, LUSD, FRAX and others once live like crvUSD etc…\n\nThis proposal can be implemented independently from the following parts. In this case, “classic” gauges would be advised. Otherwise, the strategy & smBPT gauges discussions will be outlined & discussed in Part III.\n\n# Technical Specifications:\n\n* Remove the BPT 80/20 from the current main module (30% slashing)\n* Deploy two other modules on the SM for the new categories (45% & 60% slashing)\n* Implement the new assets voted on Part II for the new categories\n* Create the new pools depending on vote results\n\n# Voting Options\n\nYAE - Implement Changes\nNAE- Rework Proposal\nABSTAIN\n\n# Disclaimer\n\nThe Llama is not compensated by any of the mentioned communities outside of Aave.\n\nLlama is an unpaid delegate within the Balancer ecosystem.\n\nMembers who contributed to this proposal are not angel investors or advisors to any of the mentioned communities but some do hold small holdings in those communities tokens.\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n\n# References\n\n1.

A 5M GHO swap resulting in a low quoted price impact.\n\n![Screenshot 2024-09-25 at 16.31.13](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Skw0hibAA.png)\n\nOverall, TVL is sitting around $45M with the amount of GHO allocated to DEXes being approximately 10M. These numbers don't account for GHO Stability Modules (GSM) totaling 16M across USDC and USDT. \n\n![Screenshot 2024-09-22 at 13.32.20](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HJXwCYaTR.png)\n\nThe Tricrypto pool on Curve and 80/20 wstETH/GHO pool on Balancer have seen inflows in response coordinating liquidity and boosting rewards to those pools. By workingly closely with various fund managers, we have been able to achieve significant deposit growth over the last month. \n\nWith perp funding rates drifting lower, the cost of capital has also drifted lower from 17.5% to around 10-12%. In general, providing DEX liquidity has become more attraction from a capital allocation perspective. However, stkGHO remains the more attractive investment and we consistently receive this feedback from various fund managers across the industry.\n\n![Screenshot 2024-09-22 at 13.52.38](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Bkc7X56aA.png)\n\nOn Ethereum, the more battle tested pools like [Balancer's GHO/USDC/USDT 3pool](https://balancer.fi/pools/ethereum/v2/0x8353157092ed8be69a9df8f95af097bbf33cb2af0000000000000000000005d9) have had good success with attracting liquidity relative to the newer [ECLPs by Gyroscope](https://app.gyro.finance/pools/ethereum/). On Arbitrum, with a more retail LP user base, the reverse appears to be true. \n\nMore generally, this is leading to a re-think of how we approach ECLPs in general with Maverick proving to be more effective and responsive as a peg defense tool on Ethereum with over 6M of liquidity.\n\nThe [Notional Finance](https://www.notional.finance/vaults/mainnet/0xeeb885af7c8075aa3b93e2f95e1c0bd51c758f91/CreateVaultPosition?borrowOption=0x00000000eeb885af7c8075aa3b93e2f95e1c0bd51c758f910003ffffffffff0a) integration provides a large portion of the 3pool liquidity on Balancer by offering users the ability to leverage farm the incentives to amplify the returns. Leveraging the BPT postion on Aura Finance, has proven an effective tool to help support the peg.\n\nThe below provides an overview of GHO's current liquidity incentive distribution on Ethereum:\n\n![Screenshot 2024-09-22 at 13.26.19](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/r1jepF6pA.png)\n\n\n## Arbitrum\n\nGHO's growth on Arbitrum has been slower than intended due to lack of volume through the bridge. \n\nThere is no native supply on Aave and transferring GHO to Arbitrum for yield is directly competing with stkGHO and liquidity provisioning on Ethereum. Borrowing GHO on Ethereum to provide liquidity on Arbitrum requires extra steps and generates similar returns. Of the GHO that was coordinated through the bridge, a large portion has been swapped out of DEX liquidity pools and now resides on Aave. The ability to arbitrum GHO's price between networks becomes more practical with growing supply on both networks.\n\nThe above has influenced in GHO consistently trading above $1.00, with a 5M swap resulting in a higher price impact (above 50%). The TVL in GHO pools in Arbitrum is $5.7M, with GHO representing about $1.2M.\n\n# Phase IV Lookahead\n\n## Ethereum\n\nIn the near future we expect GHO to be listed on InstadApp with several curated vaults providing additional utility and yield opportunites that use GHO.\n\nA sUSDS/GHO strategy vault is expected to launch on Contango with support from the Contango team. Early stage discussions with prospective investors is promising.\n\nWe also expect GHO to feature in the upcoming Royco launch with the intent to drive flows into several yield strategies across Ethereum and Arbitrum.\n\nAchieving 50M of DEX liquidity on Ethereum across various integrations remains a key focus. Whilst we are yet to acheive this target, we are currently very well positioned for current market conditions. \n\nThe 80/20 wstETH/GHO pool on Balancer and GHO/wBTC/wstETH pool on Curve are to be consolidated into GHO/tBTC/wETH pool. This is expected to reduce cost and offer better swap routings.\n\nIn the near future, we expect further joint collaborations between Paxos, Balancer and the ALC resulting in a new liquidity pool and acheiving the 50M TVL target. Looking beyond this, there will be an increasing focus on integrations that create utility for GHO.\n\nWith GHO surpassing 150M circulating supply and approaching 50M in DEX liquidity, we expect potential opportunities for the ALC to support GHO listing on centralised exchanges. \n\nWhen accounting for the above, the proposed quarterly budget for the Ethereum ecosystem is 650,000 GHO.\n\n## Arbitrum\n\nTo boost GHO supply on Arbitrum, the September Finance update proposes transferring 5M GHO from the Treasury on Ethereum to Aave v3 on Arbitrum. This is substantially increase the GHO supply on the network.\n\nIn the near future, we expect GHO to be listed on Synthetixs v3 with under-utilised liquidity deposited into Aave v3 to earn yield.\n\nA USDe/aGHO ECLP is to launch soon with x30 Sats with support from the ALC. \n\nThe ALC's focus on Arbitrum is shifting towards creating utility and demand sinks for GHO as DEX liquidity is well positioned to support the peg. \n\nThe previous ARB budget for GHO liquidity on Arbitrum was 375,000 ARB over 3 months. This is equivalent to around $200,000 at spot prices. With the expected GHO listing on Synthetix in the near future, the overal Arbitrum budget is to replace existing liquidity spending and also focus on the broader adoption of GHO within the ecosystem.\n\nThe quarterly budget for the Arbitrum ecosystem is 300,000 GHO. \n\n## Performance Metrics\n\nThe below details some high-level GHO metrics:\n\n| Description | Ethereum Value | Arbitrum Value |\n| --------  | :--------:  | :--------:  |\n| TVL DEX Liquidity Pools | 50M | 30M |\n| TVL Utility Liquidity Pools (Excl. stkGHO)  | 15M  | 10M |\n| DEX Liquidity Composition | < 50% GHO (< 33% for 3pools)  | < 50% GHO (< 33% for 3pools)  |\n| Swap Price Impact $5M Swap (GHO to USDC) | < 0.10%  | < 0.25%  |\n| Annualised Peg Volatility | < 5.00%  | < 5.00%  |\n| Price level for >90% time | $0.995 using [Redstone Medium Price](https://app.redstone.finance/#/app/token/GHO)  | $0.995 using [Redstone Medium Price](https://app.redstone.finance/#/app/token/GHO) |\n\nPlease note, each of the above targets has external dependencies beyond the control of the ALC. The above table serves as a North Star for the ALC to strive towards over the next three months. Having measurable targets provides a clear direction and goal to achieve.\n\n# Specification\n\nCreate an Allowance for GHO on Ethereum for a total of 950,000 GHO.\n\nALC Ethereum SAFE: `0xA1c93D2687f7014Aaf588c764E3Ce80aF016229b`\n\n# Disclosure\n\nTokenLogic and karpatkey receive no payment for this proposal. TokenLogic and karpatkey are both delegates within the Aave community.\n\n# Next Steps\n\n1. Gather feedback from the community.\n2. If consensus is reached on this ARFC, escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n3. If Snapshot outcome is YAE, an AIP will implement this proposal.\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

        "body": "---\n\ntitle: [TEMP CHECK] Polygon v2 to v3 Liquidity Migration \nAuthor: TokenLogic @MatthewGraham\nDated: 2023-03-18\n\n---\n\n# Simple Summary\n\nTokenLogic presents an opportunity to help kick start the migration from v2 to v3 by capitalising on the favourable conditions presented by the imminent multi-token liquidity mining program on the Polygon v3 market.\n\n# Abstract\n\nOn Polygon, there are two Aave deployments in production and the majority of the liquidity is deposited into the obsolete v2 deployment. With Chainlink expected to monetise oracles, v2 partially frozen and several communities about to distribute rewards on v3, this publication seeks to further encourage the migration of users from v2 to v3.\n\nWith SD, LDO, stMATIC and MaticX rewards to be flowing across the v3 deployment imminently, Aave is presented with an incredibly unique set of conditions that offer an ideal opportunity for further encouraging the onboarding of users onto the v3 deployment. The lion share of TVL on Polygon v2 could be migrated with simple changes presented within.\n\nThis publication provides initial parameter changes supportive of encouraging the migration of funds without putting any users' positions at risk of liquidation. Users with debt positions are encouraged to migrate to reduce borrowing costs and users with deposits are encouraged to migrate to receive a higher deposit rate.\n\nThis initiative is open for discussion and will be changed to reflect the evolving discussion in the comments section below. The key consideration here is the oversized upside realized by acting early during the liquidity mining campaign.  \n\n# Motivation\n\nIn recent months, Llama’s has coordinated across several teams to bring Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs) and rewards to the Polygon v3 deployment. Stader Labs is currently distributing SD rewards, with Lido DAO and Polygon Foundation expected to commence distributing LDO, MaticX and stMATIC rewards in the very near future. Next week, cough.\n\nNormally, with rewards being distributed across the Aave v3 deployment, usage and therefore deposit rates are expected to increase. However, on this occasion, incentives are not expected to be applied to stable coin deposits and the higher deposit rate on stable coins will need to be demand driven. \n\nCurrently, Aave v2 offers higher deposit rates and higher borrowing rates on 2 of 3 major stable coins. Table 1 below compares the three main stable coins. \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/IoyNytW.png)\n\nFor stable coin deposit rates to increase on v3, the liquidity mining will be reliant on wMATIC, stMATIC and MaticX deposits being used as collateral to borrow stable coins. With this approach to liquidity mining, some demand for borrowing stable coins is expected on v3, but it is not certain and it creates the need for further action from the Aave community to encourage migration.\n\nThis proposed upgrade, coinciding with the lucrative incentive campaign on v3, is intended to further encourage users to migrate from v2 to v3 by reducing the v2 deployments capital efficiency. V2 will remain very much functional and supportive of communities to migrate to v3 on their timeline. \n\nFor reserves where the utilization is less than the Uoptimal value, this proposal seeks to update the Uoptimal parameter to be the midpoint between current utilization and Uoptimal value. This will lead to higher borrowing costs, estimated to be around 35% higher (borrow interest 2.37% to 2.96%) on average for the main stable coins, and if the RF is not adjusted, will lead to higher deposit rates. By increasing the RF, from 10% to around 30%, the additional interest that would have been received by depositors will be redirected to Aave’s Collector Contract. As a result, deposit rates will not meaningfully change on v2 and borrow rates increase.\n\nIf/when the liquidity mining on v3 leads to higher borrowing cost, if no action is taken on v2, v2 will offer the lowest borrowing rates. For assets like wETH, BTC and AAVE being used as collateral to borrow stable coins there will be no incentive to migrate to v3. By increasing borrowing rates on v2, the v3 deployment will remain more competitive when utilization on comparable reserves are similar, see Table 2. In fact, the v3 deployment can have higher utilization and still offer a lower cost of capital which gives v3 a competitive advantage over v2, see Table 3.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/csUT2wP.png)\n\nIf just the RF was increased on v2, then deposit rates on v2 would reduce and borrowing which is already slightly more expensive relative to v3 would remain unchanged, thus providing no additional incentive for borrowers to migrate. This is especially true for those that have deposited wMATIC, wETH or wBTC and borrowed stable coins. Thus the need to increase borrowing costs on v2 relative to v3.\n\nBy decreasing the Uoptimal value, the capital efficiency of the reserves is reduced and with each redemption/deposit (removal of liquidity) the borrowing rate will be more sensitive as the gradient of the first portion of the interest rate curve is slightly steeper. Each larger redemption, withdrawal of liquidity, will cause borrow rates to increase that bit more than otherwise which continues to encourage migration over time.\n\nTo continually adjust the Uoptimal lower would be a rather aggressive approach towards migrating users. Until the timeline around when Chainlink intends to begin charging for oracles, future changes may focus on reducing the deposit rate by adjusting the RF over time. For frozen assets, adjusting the RF appears to be the most effective way forward as it was shown to be successful when applied to FEI.\n\nAs rewards being distributed on Aave v3 are finite (bear market) and for a limited amount of time (3 months), the time to initiate the migration from v2 to v3 is now. With any luck, the rewards will lead to a lot of funds migrating and this proposal then ensures v2 offers higher borrow costs relative to v3 which further encourages migration. There is a risk here that the borrow cost increase proposed in this proposal is too subtle. However, this is not intended to be a mass migration push proposal but instead a smaller change that compliments the v3 liquidity mining program to Aave benefit. \n\nFollow up proposals can further adjust Upotimal values once utilization on reserves like USDT have reverted back to more normal conditions.\n\n### Uoptimal Parameter\n\nThis publication splits the difference between current utilization and Uoptimal values. Ie: If utilization is 20% and the Uoptimal is 60%, then the proposed Uoptimal is 40%, the midpoint between the existing utilization and Uoptimal value.\n\n### Slope 2 Parameter\n\nBy reducing the Uoptimal parameter, the gradient of the borrow rate between utilisations Uoptimal and 100% is lowered. In order to maintain the current gradient, the Slope2 parameter is revised higher. In the image below, Slope 2 changes from 75% to 150% in response to the Uoptimal parameter being reduced from 80% to 60%. Notice how the red and blue lines are parallel during the second leg of the curve, this is because they have the same gradient. \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ojX6SLn.png)\n\n### Reserve Factor\n\nAs a portion of the interest paid by borrowers is directed to users who provide liquidity, by increasing the borrow rate, the deposit rate also increases assuming the reserves utilization remains unchanged. To counter the higher deposit rate, which encourages more deposits, the RF is increased.  This redirects  interest paid by borrowers to Aave instead of depositors. The table in the Specification section outlines how each RF is adjusted to keep the deposit rate mostly unchanged despite the higher borrow rates. \n\nDue to abnormally high USDT usage, 84.51% at the time of writing, this proposal suggests increasing the RF to be the average of proposed DAI and USDC RFs. The justification for this is to reduce the deposit rate of USDT, such that it encourages migration whilst avoiding reducing the Uoptimal such that borrowing cost increases substantially by shifting utilizing onto the more stepper portion of the yield curve. When utilization drops by a material amount, it would be prudent to reduce the Uoptiomal value in line with other stable coins. \n\n# Specification\n\nTable 4 below presents the current asset configuration on Polygon v2.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/An2aWJq.png)\n\nBased upon the methodology presented above, Table 5 details the parameter changes.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/2gqgoQr.png)\n\nDo note, the parameters to be changed have been rounded to nearest whole number and no Uoptimal was increased.\n\nPior to any AIP submission the numbers should be updated in line with the strategy to avoid any un-favourable parameter configurations. \n\n# Next Steps\n\nCommunity discussion, whereby any service provider or contributor can elect to work with the author on the implementation. The main intent here is for Aave to make the most of the rewards distribution programs that are about to add to Stader Lab’s existing reward program.\n\nIt would be greatly appreciated if a risk service provider could confirm the above will not adversely affect users, which hopefully will resonate with delegates within the community.\n\nThe key with this proposal is time, as rewards on v3 will last only a finite amount of time. The author believes the changes presented here within, thought of as a one-off, or opportunistic, will lead to the migration of the majority of most liquidity. The liquidity mining campaign coordinated by Llama should be capitalized upon. \n\n# Disclosoure\n\nTokenLogic is publishing this proposal as the scope falls outside of Llama’s core role within the Aave ecosystem, that said, at TokenLogic we are more than happy for any contributor to progress this proposal. There are no payments to TokenLogic, direct or indirect, relating to this forum post. \n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",
