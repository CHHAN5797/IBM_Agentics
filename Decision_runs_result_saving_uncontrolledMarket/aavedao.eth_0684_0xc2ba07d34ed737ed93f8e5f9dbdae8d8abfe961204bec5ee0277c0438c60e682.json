        "author": "0xfdA462548Ce04282f4B6D6619823a7C64Fdc0185",
        "body": "Author: Angle Core Team\nForum Post: https://governance.aave.com/t/listing-proposal-add-ageur-on-aave-v3-on-polygon/7325\n\n\n## Summary\n\nThe purpose of this AIP is to list agEUR, Angle Protocol's decentralized Euro, on Aave V3 when it deploys on Polygon.\n\nAngle Protocol is a decentralized stablecoin protocol designed to be both over-collateralized and capital-efficient.  \nThe protocol has started by launching agEUR, a Euro stablecoin in November. This stablecoin has become one of the biggest in the market with a supply of 129m, a TVL in the protocol > $225m, and an average daily volume > $4m.\n\nagEUR can at the moment only be issued on Ethereum mainnet, but it can be bridged on many different chains, like on Polygon with the PoS bridge.\n\nSo far, there are more than 8m agEUR on Polygon with deep liquidity on Quickswap ($14m liquidity) and on Curve (~$2.5m).  \nBesides Quickswap and Curve on Polygon, on mainnet agEUR has liquidity pools on UniswapV3 ($48m liquidity for agEUR/USDC), Sushiswap ($11m for agEUR/ANGLE) and Curve ($130m). The stablecoin can be minted in a capital-efficient way at oracle value from the protocol meaning liquidity for it could be theorically infinite.\n\nStablecoin is also available on Fantom, Harmony, BSC, Avalanche, Solana, NEAR, Aurora and Fuse.\n\nThe stablecoin is over-collateralized (current collateral ratio = 155%), it is backed by USDC, DAI, FEI and FRAX. The protocol insures itself against the $/€ change risk by issuing perpetual futures and by the deposits of another type of agent incentivized by the strategies built by the protocol (involving lending to Aave).\n\n## Links & References\n\n-   [Docs](https://docs.angle.money/)\n-   Token Contracts: All Angle related contract addresses can be found [here](https://developers.angle.money/protocol-overview/smart-contracts)\n-   [Smart contracts/Code](https://github.com/AngleProtocol)\n-   [Analytics](https://analytics.angle.money/)\n\nagEUR has no Chainlink feed yet but it passes all the security requirements to get eligible to a feed. If this Snapshot vote is positive, then the Chainlink team could setup this oracle pretty rapidly.\n\n## Security Considerations and Risk Analysis\n\nAngle has had three different audits by Chainsecurity and Sigma Prime which can be found [here](https://docs.angle.money/resources/audits). It also has a $500k bug bounty on Immunefi.\n\nAngle Protocol is a decentralized stablecoin protocol, it is ruled by the ANGLE token and more generally by the veANGLE token (which went live in January)\n\nVotes by veANGLE holders are implemented by a 4/6 multisig composed of 3 core team members (Guillaume Nervo, Picodes, Pablo Veyrat), Julien Bouteloup, 0xMaki and SebVentures.\n\nagEUR token contract on mainnet is upgradeable and can be upgraded by the multisig described above. Only protocol related contracts have minting rights on this contract, and so there's no multisig or EOA that can directly mint agEUR at the moment.\nagEUR on Polygon can also be upgraded by a multisig on Polygon. Only Polygon PoS has the minting right on the contract.\n\nagEUR has been assessed by Curve Team, report is available [here](https://cryptorisks.substack.com/p/ageur-angle-protocol?utm_source=url)\n\n## Benefits for Aave V3\n\nagEUR could be an interesting asset for Aave V3 efficiency modes: for instance if there is an efficiency mode with other Euro stablecoins, we could imagine people taking advantage of Aave V3 to get significant leverage and to arb the stablecoin back to peg (leveraging Curve and potentially Quickswap as well).\n\nAngle community could even push for shifting incentives from Quickswap to UniV3 on Polygon to allow for better arbs leveraging Aave.\n\nagEUR could also be another asset in Aave’s Polygon efficiency mode for stablecoins in general allowing for interesting FX arbs here as well.\n\nOn top of that, in the first place agEUR could be used in isolation mode which means this asset would induce very small risk for the Aave protocol as a whole.\n\nAs for the overall benefit of agEUR for the Aave community, many agEUR holders are looking for a reliable place to deposit their stablecoins and get a simple yield on this. Aave would provide this use case.  \nMore generally, many DeFi farmers are coming from Europe and want to get a yield on their home currency without being exposed to a USD/EUR change risk. Listing agEUR on Aave would open the gates for many institutional players coming to get yield on their €.\n\nBesides arbitrageurs, we could expect borrowers of agEUR to be people wanting to either take advantage of the different yield opportunities provided by LPing agEUR or by people wanting to get leveraged on another asset while being exposed to the € price of it (and not the $).\n\n## Risk Parameters\n\nWith the liquidity on Polygon in mind, the following parameters are proposed:\n\n1.  V3 Efficiency mode EUR stablecoins (if it exists): 97% LTV, 98% liquidation threshold, 10% reserve factor\n2.  V3 Efficiency mode stablecoins: 90% LTV, 95% Liquidation threshold, 10% reserve factor\n3.  V3 Isolation mode: 60% LTV, 80% liquidation threshold, 20% reserve factor, 5M$ debt ceiling\n\n## Protocol Data\n\n### Market Data\n\n- Market Cap: $145m, ($8.7m on Polygon)\n- 24h volume: typically ranges between $2-$20m\n\n### Social Channels\n\n- Twitter: 25.9k\n- Discord: 31.2k\n\n### Contracts date of deployments, number of transactions, number of holders for tokens:\n\nOn mainnet:\n\n-   **Date of Deployment**: Oct 23rd 2021\n-   **Number of Transactions**: 2347 and 15614 transfers\n-   **Number of holders for token**: 489 (NB: there are many incentive programs involving LPs of agEUR which means actual amount of holders is higher)\n\nOn Polygon:\n\n-   **Date of Deployment**: Nov 23rd 2021\n-   **Number of Transactions**: 683and 5976 transfers\n-   **Number of holders for token**: 162\n\n## Voting Options\n\nYES - deploy AAVE V3 on Polygon with agEUR listed\nNO - do not list agEUR on AAVE V3\n\n",

This stablecoin has become one of the biggest in the market with a supply of 48.7m, a TVL in the protocol of $87m, and an average daily volume > $4m. \n\nagEUR can at the moment only be issued on Ethereum mainnet, but it can be bridged on many different chains. There is an ongoing governance proposal to deploy the protocol on Polygon allowing anyone to natively mint agEUR from there.\n\nAt the moment, the PoS bridge is the only way to bridge agEUR to Polygon. But with the potential upcoming launch of the borrowing module, new bridge solutions will be added, like Layer Zero.\n\nThere are so far more than 3m agEUR on Polygon with deep liquidity [on Uniswap](https://info.uniswap.org/#/polygon/pools/0x3fa147d6309abeb5c1316f7d8a7d8bd023e0cd80) and on [Curve](https://polygon.curve.fi/factory/209). \nBesides Uniswap and Curve on Polygon, agEUR has deep liquidity on UniswapV3, Sushiswap and Curve on mainnet. The stablecoin can be minted at oracle value meaning liquidity for it could be theorically infinite.\n\nStablecoin is also available on Fantom, Harmony, BSC, Avalanche, Solana, NEAR, Aurora, Fuse, with plans for deployment on other chains where Aave is supported like Arbitrum and Optimism.\n\nThe stablecoin is over-collateralized (current collateral ratio = 180%), it is backed by USDC, DAI, FEI and FRAX. The protocol insures itself against the $/€ change risk by issuing perpetual futures and by the deposits of another type of agent incentivized by the strategies built by the protocol (involving lending to Aave).\nThe protocol has also launched a new module that allows people to borrow agEUR against wETH, wstETH and wBTC. It is this version of the protocol that will deployed on Polygon and then on other chains.\n\n## Links\n\n- Official: https://angle.money\n- Docs: https://docs.angle.money\n- Token Contracts: [Mainnet](https://etherscan.io/token/0x1a7e4e63778b4f12a199c062f3efdd288afcbce8), [Polygon](https://polygonscan.com/address/0xe0b52e49357fd4daf2c15e02058dce6bc0057db4).

This would provide a use case that exists nowhere else in DeFi around agEUR: the opportunity to long the € and short the $ through agEUR.\n\nRight now it is possible to borrow agEUR, but not to borrow from agEUR: like you could borrow USDC or another USD stablecoin, swap it for agEUR (with little slippage) and hence get a short on the $/long on the €. This may not be the trend of the moment but definitely something to consider for the future.\n\nRelative to the size of agEUR on Aave, there’s also agEUR liquidity available for this kind of opportunities at the moment.\n\nDoing this in isolation mode would mean this asset would induce very small risk for the Aave protocol as a whole.\n\n\n\n## Risk Parameters\n\nWith the liquidity on Polygon in mind, I propose the following risk parameter linked to the isolation mode. Obviously this is a first proposition and governance/risk team is more suited to choose better risk parameters.\n\nV3 Isolation mode: 60% LTV, 80% liquidation threshold, 20% reserve factor, 3M$ debt ceiling. This is a conservative debt ceiling, given the mainnet liquidity we could also imagine efficient cross-chain liquidators coming to liquidate even if liquidity is too small on Polygon\n\n## Specifications \n\n**1. What is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset?**  \nAs mentioned in the disclaimer, I am a Core Contributor of the Angle Protocol.\n\n**2. Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token**  \nSee agEUR summary section\n\n**3. Explain positioning of token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset?**  \nSee Benefits for Aave section.\n\n**4. Provide a brief history of the project and the different components: DAO (is it live?), products (are the live?).**  \n\nAngle Protocol is a decentralized stablecoin protocol, it is ruled by the ANGLE token and more generally by the veANGLE token. Like many other projects, Angle DAO has indeed adopted the ve tokenomics. \n\nThe platform was released [on November 3rd 2021.](https://blog.angle.money/angle-is-live-on-the-ethereum-mainnet-a8253162daf0).\nANGLE locking went live [in January](https://blog.angle.money/veangle-is-live-on-mainnet-4d702fcf7584). Votes by veANGLE holders are implemented by a 4/6 multisig composed of 3 core team members (including myself), [Julien Bouteloup](https://twitter.com/bneiluj), [0xMaki](https://twitter.com/0xMaki) and [SebVentures](https://twitter.com/SebVentures).\n\n**5. How is the asset currently used?**  \n\nThe asset is a € stablecoin. It is used by people as a means of exchange to pay in Euros in DeFi, or to keep a stable asset value in reserves before aping in elsewhere.\n\nIt is also used as a way to get yield in many places in DeFi\n\n**6. Emission schedule**  \n\nToken can only be issued following the rules of the protocol on mainnet: at oracle value if someone has provided either USDC, DAI, FEI, FRAX, or wETH. agEUR can also be borrowed from Angle Borrowing module at a 0.5% rate. \nThere’s no emission schedule for the token.\n\n**7. Token (& Protocol) permissions (minting) and upgradability. Is there a multisig? What can it do? Who are the signers?**  \n\nagEUR token contract on mainnet is upgradeable and can be upgraded by the [multisig ](https://gnosis-safe.io/app/eth:0xdC4e6DFe07EFCa50a197DF15D9200883eF4Eb1c8/balances) described above.\nagEUR on Polygon can also be upgraded by a [multisig on Polygon](https://polygonscan.com/address/0xdA2D2f638D6fcbE306236583845e5822554c02EA).\n\n**8.

        "body": "**Author**: Jarvis Network Core Team\n**Forum post**: [Listing proposal: add jEUR on Aave v3 on Polyon](https://governance.aave.com/t/listing-proposal-add-jeur-on-aave-v3-on-polyon/7353)\n\n\n# Summary\nThe purpose of this AIP is to list Jarvis Network's jEUR, a synthetic euro stablecoins, on Aave V3 when it deploys on Polygon. jEUR is a liquid and capital-efficient Euro stablecoin collateralized with USDC, and with a working 0-fee fiat on and off-ramp. jEUR can be converted for USDC back and forth at the Chainlink price feed, granting it liquidity and peg on our primary market. jEUR is used by other Euro stablecoins on Polygon in Curve’s pools to help them with their own peg and liquidity.\n\n# About Jarvis Network\nSynthereum is the first protocol of the [Jarvis Network](https://jarvis.network). It provides a capital-efficient manner to issue and exchange synthetic fiat currencies called jFIATs, on Ethereum, Polygon, Gnosis Chain, Avalanche, and the BNB Chain.\n\njFIATs’ main feature is their convertibility for their collateral (USDC on Polygon) and for other jFIATs at the oracle price, without price impact, enabling a 0-slippage on-chain Forex. This feature makes them usable: since one can convert them for USDC at any time, they keep their peg, and have the same market depth as USDC, and therefore are very liquid.\n\nThe protocol is integrated within Paraswap, so users can swap jEUR for any other token.\n\nWe have partnered with [Mt Pelerin](https://www.mtpelerin.com/), a Swiss regulated entity, to provide users with a 0-fee 1:1 fiat on and off-ramp, directly on Polygon (and other EVM chains). Anyone can go from their Euro bank account to jEUR on Polygon, back and forth. One can even pay invoices in Euros using jEUR (our company only uses jEUR to pay invoices, salaries, rent, and even taxes, since July last year).\n\nCombined with Paraswap, this partnership with Mt Pelerin creates a system that can replace CEX, and provide users with a way to buy any token on Polygon with Euros, at a better rate than most CEX (including Binance, Kraken, etc.).\n\nWe also have launched jXAF/jXOF, which are wrappers of jEUR (XAF and XOF are pegged to the Euro) to address the African market (+ we are building a fiat on and off-ramp in Africa). Any integration of jEUR is therefore accessible to jXAF/jXOF holders.\n\njEUR is a vital Euro stablecoin for the Polygon ecosystem since it can be converted for USDC at the oracle price; therefore, other euro stablecoins can be paired on Curve with jEUR in order to facilitate arbitrages to maintain their peg, or simply to access greater liquidity.\n\nWe debuted on Polygon around September. Currently, version 1 of the protocol is live and is limited (only 625k USDC of liquidity has been deposited for jEUR). A second version of the protocol, without those limitations, will be launched soon.\n\nThe protocol is very capital efficient and does not need a high TVL to works. 625k of USDC has enabled since October:\n\n- 3.5M jEUR in circulation ($4M).\n- $78M of volume on our primary market.\n- 33k swaps by 9k users.\n- $20M of transfers (wallet to wallet, excluding swaps).\n- $50M on secondary markets (Curve, Kyber).\n- $10M of fiat on and off-ramp.\n- 10k cumulative holders with 3k jEUR current holders.\n\n# Benefits for Aave V3\n### Fiat on and off-ramp\njEUR has the cheapest and most direct fiat on and off-ramp, which can create a direct bridge between banks and a “Euro savings account” on the Blockchain.\n\nWe have multiple non-individuals (companies) who are looking for a place to save Euro on the blockchain without taking the risks of yield farming programs (like on Curve).\n\nHaving jEUR on Aave, combined with our fiat on-ramp, would allow this use case to become a reality, and would allow users to borrow jEUR and off-ramp them for Euros.\n\n### Large addressable market\nA part from the Euro zone, jEUR is a vital part of our African strategy. jEUR can be wrapped into jXAF or jXOF, and we are working on abstracting jEUR for the end-users (people in Africa could deposit jXAF into Aave and earn interest on top of it; in reality, we would unwrap the jXAF for jEUR, but the end-user won’t see it).\n\n### jEUR is vital for other Euro stablecoins\njEUR being convertible for USDC at the Chainlink price feed, and being used by other euro stablecoins to maintain their peg and access liquidity (with a few more Euro stablecoins to join the party), it would be a perfect asset to borrow with leverage to perform arbitrages on Polygon.\n\n### DDM\njEUR also has a Direct Deposit Module allowing our DAO to mint uncollateralized jEUR and deposit them directly into money markets, to maintain a low-interest rate if needed.\n\n### Low risk collateral\nAs collateral, jEUR is also pretty safe since it always keep its peg and there is no slippage when buying/selling it on our primary market.\n\njEUR could be used in isolation mode to limit the risk for Aave.\n\njEUR has no Chainlink price feed but it uses the EURUSD price feed of Chainlink to settle its trades.\n\n\n# Risk Parameters\nWith the liquidity on Polygon in mind, I propose the following risk parameters. Obviously, this is the first proposition and the governance and risk team is more suited to choose better risk parameters:\n\n1. V3 Efficiency mode EUR stablecoins (if it exists): 97% LTV, 98% liquidation threshold, 10% reserve factor\n2. V3 Efficiency mode stablecoins: 90% LTV, 95% Liquidation threshold, 10% reserve factor\n3. V3 Isolation mode: 50% LTV, 80% liquidation threshold, 20% reserve factor, 2M$ debt ceiling.\n\n# Security specification and risks\n\n### Risks inherent to jEUR\nBesides obvious smart contract risks, jEUR is over-collateralized with USDC, and therefore inherit from all the risk born by USDC.\n\njEUR liquidiations are secured by the UMA’s DVM oracle and jEUR trading happens at the Chainlink price feed, therefore jEUR inhereit from the risks of these two protocols.\n\n\n[More informations about the risks](https://learn.jarvis.network/protocol-overview/risks)\n\n\n### Token (& Protocol) permissions (minting) and upgradability.\njEUR can only be minted following the rules of the protocol on Polygon: users can send $X USDC to the liquidity pool to mint $X of jEUR, or the multi-sig can call the minting function from the DDM module.\n\nThere is currently no DAO, only a community-owned multisig (5/8) managing the treasury and two company-owned multisig (2/3), one admin and one maintainer (the admin can only add or revoke a maintainer). The maintainer can upgrade some parts of the protocols: minting and burning fees, address receiving the fees, adding/removing a new jFIAT, adding/removing supported collateral, calling the emergency shutdown function (settle all the jFIAT at the Chainlink price feed); changing the price feed.\n\nIt does not have any access/control over any funds. and we are transitioning to a ve-model together with a token rebranding in Q2, accompanying the launch our the protocol v2.\n\n### Audits\nWe have had two different audits by [Halborn](https://halborn.com/) and [Ubik](https://ubikgroup.co/): [Read the audits](https://learn.jarvis.network/protocol-overview/security)\n\n# Data\n\n\n### Market data (Market Cap, 24h Volume, Volatility, Exchanges, Maturity)\n- Market Cap: €3.5M circulating ($4M)\n- 24h Volume: $2M on our primary market, $400k on secondary markets\n- Volatility: Low\n- Maturity: Early\n\n### Social channels data (Size of communities, activity on Github)\n- Discord: 3k members\n- Twitter: 16.1k followers\n\n### Contracts date of deployments, number of transactions, number of holders for tokens\n- Date of Deployment: Sep 2021 (Polygon)\n- Number of Transactions: 116k transactions including 30k swaps on our primary market and 22k on secondary markets.\n- Number of holders for token: 3,242 (more holders possible due to farming programs)\n\n# Links\n- Website: [https://jarvis.network](https://jarvis.network)\n- Dune: [Jarvis Dashboard](https://dune.xyz/0xroll/JarvisNetwork)\n- Docs: [https://learn.jarvis.network](https://learn.jarvis.network)\n- Code: [https://gitlab.com/jarvis-network](https://gitlab.com/jarvis-network)\n\n# Voting options\n- YES, add jEUR on Aave v3 on Polygon\n- NO, do not add jEUR on Aave v3 on Polygon\n",

        "body": "Author: Alchemix Core Team\nForum Post: https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-add-alusd-as-borrowable-to-aave-v2/7191\n\n# Summary\nThe purpose of this AIP is to list alUSD as a borrowable asset on Aave. alUSD has established itself as one of the leading new stablecoins in terms of stability and liquidity, and listing on Aave will provide users with a proven stablecoin to borrow. Alchemix has 376m TVL in the form of yvDAI and DAI backing alUSD, with a liquid supply of 239m alUSD. alUSD has one of the deepest Curve pools, with ~450m in liquidity. In addition to the Curve pool, alUSD has additional liquidity on Sushiswap, Saddle, and mStable. According to Parsec Finance’s StableRank, alUSD is routinely among the top stablecoins in terms of price stability and liquidity within 1% slippage. Having been on the market for over 6 months while maintaining the peg through turbulent market conditions, alUSD has built the reputation required to be an asset listed on AAVE.\n\n[alUSD StableRank Screenshot](https://imgur.com/a/iMyToUj)\n\n# About Alchemix and alUSD\nAlchemix is an evolution of the tried and true CDP model trailblazed by MakerDAO. Alchemix is, at its core, an overcollateralized stablecoin, much like DAI and other similar tokens. It has some key differences however.\n\nAlchemix only mints like-kind or “mirror” al-Assets. For example, alUSD is only mintable by DAI (and later USDT and USDC), and alETH is only mintable by ETH (and later other ETH derivatives). Deposited collateral is then deployed to yearn, of which the earned yield doubly repays users’ debt and backs the dollar peg in the Transmuter module. In addition, there is no interest paid in the borrowing of al-Assets. Due to this structure, Alchemix does not have liquidations in its system. This allows people to maximum borrow without fear of shifting market conditions - taking an essentially risk free negative interest alUSD loan with their DAI. In effect, the system acts as a way to get an advance on your yield for your stablecoin deposits.\n\nAlchemix ensures the alUSD peg with the following mechanisms.\n1. 50% LTV for minting alUSD, which prevents excessive recursive leverage in the protocol.\n2. DAO-managed debt caps that limit the over-minting of alUSD\n3. The ability to repay debt in alUSD or DAI. If alUSD is under the peg, people can buy it off the market and repay their loan at a discount. If alUSD is over the peg, users can sell alUSD to DAI and repay with DAI to arbitrage the price, and they can self-liquidate their collateral to mint more alUSD to trade to DAI for arbitrage.\n4. The Transmuter module guarantees 1:1 conversions of alUSD to DAI, the conversion process isn’t instant, but it can present good arbitrage opportunities, which helps to stabilize the peg.\n5. Alchemix rewards ALCX governance tokens for alUSD liquidity providers, which attracts liquidity to the pool, further boosting the peg.\n\nalUSD minted from a new loan has a collateralization ratio of 200%, while alUSD minted from repaid debt has a collateralization ratio of 100%. The total global collateralization ratio for alUSD is 157%. The supply can expand in two ways – an expansion in the debt ceiling followed by users taking new loans, or debt repayments with DAI, which decrement the global debt while not destroying alUSD. This is how we have a supply of ~239m with a current debt cap of 150m. alUSD can be burned by staking it in the transmuter, where it is converted 1:1 to DAI over time.\n\nThese mechanisms in tandem have allowed for alUSD to remain extremely close to the $1 peg since its inception.\n\n# Motivation\nalUSD has established itself as a reliable and liquid stablecoin. In addition to protocol improvements, Alchemix DAO believes that integrating alUSD throughout DeFi will help us in that goal. Because AAVE is the leading lending protocol across all of crypto, getting on AAVE as a borrowable asset would lend a lot of legitimacy to alUSD. The more tightly integrated alUSD is within DeFi, the more resilient it will become, which will allow alUSD to safely grow in supply.\n\nGoing forward, Alchemix will expand beyond our current set up of using DAI in the yvDAI yearn vault as collateral, and expand the selection of stablecoin collaterals and yield earning strategies. AAVE is one such source of yield that we are looking to plug into in the future. When these upgrades take place, we predict that Alchemix will be one of the larger liquidity providers to AAVE, similar to how Alchemix is currently one of the largest liquidity providers on Yearn.\n\n# alUSD Benefits to Aave Users\nalUSD is desirable to borrow because it is tightly pegged to DAI, USDC, USDT, mUSD, FEI, FRAX, and LUSD in our various markets. It is simple to swap between other stables. DEX aggregators make it simple to trade between alUSD and any other asset on Ethereum too. In addition, there are attractive farming incentives for alUSD LPs. For people that are looking to borrow alUSD but don’t have stablecoins from which to mint it, borrowing alUSD on AAVE will provide more options to get alUSD. The alUSD can be used for yield farming, or through highly liquid swaps into other stable coins, to finance their personal life or to speculate on the market. alUSD is also used in an alETH/alUSD options market on premia.finance. Alchemix plans to continue to expand alUSD use cases in the future through partnerships and integrations.\n\n# Security Considerations and Risk Analysis\nCertik Audit for the Core Contracts: https://alchemix.fi/a208baf6ca7e0d6b0116461f05e27cd9.pdf\n\nCurrently, the Alchemix protocol can be paused or modified by a multisig. The protocol controls the alUSD debt cap and collateralization ratio through DAO voting, which is then executed by a community + developer multisig + timelock contract. The DAO prioritizes peg stability above all else when considering parameter changes.\n\nAave has already conducted risk analysis on DAI, the current sole backing stablecoin of alUSD, and assigned an overall risk rating of B+ [Risks per Asset - Risk](https://docs.aave.com/risk/asset-risk/risks-per-asset). USDC and USDT strategies will be added as alUSD collateral later. USDC and USDT have ratings of A- and B+ respectively. The new risks from introducing alUSD are Alchemix/alUSD and Yearn Vault contract risks. Risk to Aave is minimized due to alUSD being enabled for borrowing but not as collateral.\n\nThe Alchemix DAO multisig and timelock wallet is the administrator for the alUSD token. It has the ability to grant and revoke other contracts the minter role. Currently, all alUSD minting is handled by the alchemist.sol contract. When we launch our version two, the new contracts will also be granted the minting permissions. Alchemix employs a modular approach where the Transmuter and Vault Adapter modules can be swapped out and replaced with upgraded versions. The core alchemist.sol contract cannot be upgraded, but the multisig and timelock wallet can change the following parameters: collateralization ratio, debt ceiling, and fee percentage. Each member of the core Alchemix development team has permission to enable Alchemix’s sentinel mode, which pauses the contract in case of an emergency.\n\n# Protocol Data\n### Market data (Market Cap, 24h Volume, Volatility, Exchanges, Maturity)\n- Market Cap - 242,165,957 USD.\n- 24h Volume - typically ranges between 1-4m.\n- Markets: Curve, Saddle, Sushi, mStable, Premia\n\n### Social Channels data (Size of communities, activity on github)\n- Twitter: 40.2k\n- Discord: 7.5k\n- Medium: 1.7k\n\n### Contracts date of deployments, number of transactions, number of holders for tokens:\n- alUSD Deployment Date: 2/27/2021\n- Transactions: 49,594\n- Token Holders: 1328\n\n# Implementation\nThe alUSD price oracle will be served via Chainlink.

It is an overcollateralized stablecoin that is non-custodial. All MAI is backed by collateral locked in user-managed vaults. MAI minting is available on 8 chains, and bridging to 18 chains.\n\nAll accepted collaterals are priced using Chainlink price feeds. MAI has stayed within its peg through several market downturns.\n\nThere’s around 250M MAI minted, with liquidity on all top DEXs in which MAI is present. A significant portion of liquidity for MAI is on Curve. MAI hosts the largest pool on Curve Polygon and the pool with most volume on Curve Fantom.\n\n### Risk Parameters\n\n* V3 Efficiency mode stablecoins: 97% LTV, 98% Liquidation threshold, 10% reserve factor\n* V3 Isolation mode: 75% LTV, 80% liquidation threshold, 10% reserve factor, $50M initial debt ceiling per chain\n\n### Specifications\n\n1. What is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset?\n\nCore team at QiDao Protocol.\n\n2. Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token\n\nMAI is the first and largest stablecoin protocol on Polygon. It allows users to lock their tokens and use them as collateral to mint MAI at 0% interest.\n\nMAI is an overcollateralized CDP stablecoin on Polygon, Avalanche, Fantom, Arbitrum, Harmony, Moonriver, and Gnosis Chain. MAI is one of the most crosschain assets in DeFi, currently on 18 chains through Multichain. Accepted collateral includes interest-bearing assets like Aave Market Tokens. Users are not charged interest for borrowing MAI - instead, they are charged a 0.5% fee upon repayment.\n\nDespite market downturns during its existence, MAI has maintained its peg.\n\nMAI currently has a TVL of around $350M, and has around 250M MAI outstanding.\n\n3. Explain positioning of the token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset?\nBeing the largest native stablecoin on Polygon and Fantom, MAI has a wide reach within the native projects on those chains. Listing MAI would connect Aave to most communities in these chains through the integrations already made by MAI.\n\nMAI is one of the most crosschain assets, available on 18 chains through canonical bridging. As a result, users will be drawn to borrow MAI to bridge value to other chains and take advantage of the many yield opportunities that MAI has.\n\nMAI’s risk profile is low. It is used by large institutions like Celsius and Polygon. MAI has also received grants from several blockchains, including Polygon, Fantom, Harmony, Aurora, and IoTeX.\n\n4. Provide a brief history of the project and the different components: DAO (is it live?), products (are the live?). How did it overcome some of the challenges it faced?\n\n* MAI is governed by the QiDao Protocol, a community-run DAO around the QI token.\n* Several other projects have participated in our DAO through proposals and bribing, including Frax Finance, Stake DAO, Celsius, * PolygonDAO, SpiritSwap, SpookySwap, Gotchi Vault, and Beefy Finance\n* The Polygon Alliance was recently set up to participate in QiDao.\n\n5. How is the asset currently used?\n\n* Lending (Market.xyz, Impermax, Tarot)\n* Listed on several DEXs on 18 chains. Main DEXs are Curve, Balancer, QuickSwap, SpookySwap, SpiritSwap, Solidly, Saber, and TombSwap\n* Top two pools on Curve Fantom and Polygon\n* MAI is used by Celsius to borrow against their AUM\n* MAI has been used by Polygon to award bounties\n* MAI offers low-cost leverage to strategies on Stake DAO, Yearn, Beefy, and Aave\n\n6. Emission schedule\n\nUsers can mint MAI by locking up their assets and borrowing against that value at 0% interest. Temporary debt ceilings serve as the a supply mitigation.\n\n7. Token (& Protocol) permissions (minting) and upgradability. Is there a multisig? What can it do? Who are the signers?\n\nAll funds stored as collateral are fully controlled by users\nThere is a 3/5 multisig, comprised by the QiDao team. Team members are doxxed and regularly appear on podcasts, live streams, and crypto conferences\nThe multisig executes the results of Snapshot votes: liquidation ratios for new collaterals, partnerships, and debt ceilings. There have been over 70 votes since the start of the DAO: see votes here 1.\nSince the protocol uses canonical bridging, QiDao retains the power to mint MAI on chains it is bridged to.\n\n8. Market data (Market Cap, 24h Volume, Volatility, Exchanges, Maturity)\n\n* Market Cap: ~$250M\n* 24h Volume: >$40M\n* Volatility: Low\n* Exchanges: Curve, Balancer, QuickSwap, SpookySwap, SpiritSwap, Saber, Beethoven, Solidly, TombSwap, Solarbeam, Trader Joe, Crodex, ZoomSwap, PaintSwap, Elk Finance, and Rose\n* Maturity: Launched 5/4/21\n\n9.
