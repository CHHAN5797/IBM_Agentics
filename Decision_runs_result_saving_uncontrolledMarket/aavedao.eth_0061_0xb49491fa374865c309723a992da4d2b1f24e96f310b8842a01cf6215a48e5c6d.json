        "body": "# [TEMP CHECK] Add stS to Aave v3 Sonic Instance\n\n---\n\ntitle: [TEMP CHECK] Add stS to Aave v3 Sonic Instance\nauthor: @ACI\ncreated: 2025-02-28\n\n---\n\n# Summary\n\nThe proposal aims to onboard [Beets](https://beets.fi/)'s stS, to Aave v3 Sonic instance.\n\n# Motivation\n\nLaunched in December 2024, Beets Staked Sonic (stS) is an ERC-20 Liquid Staked Token offering seamless exposure to Sonic network staking rewards via validator delegation, while remaining fully liquid in users’ wallets.\n\nSimilar to wstETH, stS passively accrues value—each time delegation rewards are added to the staking pool, the stS-to-S exchange rate increases automatically, with no action needed from holders. The underlying S delegation enhances Sonic’s decentralization across a [diverse set of validators](https://dune.com/queries/4534324/7569460) and strengthens the network’s economic security.\n\nPreviously known as sFTMx, the leading LST on Fantom Opera, stS quickly established itself as the kingmaker LST in the Sonic ecosystem, capturing over [12% of all staked S liquidity and 76% of S LST liquidity](https://www.defiwars.xyz/wars/sonic). Demand for leverage looping strategies using stS has been steadily rising, with over $160 million already deployed across other lending markets. Despite this strong demand for leveraged positions, stS has maintained a solid peg, currently trading at [99.72%](https://www.defiwars.xyz/wars/sonic).\n\nUsers can easily convert their S into stS via the [Beets minting UI](https://beets.fi/stake) and redeem their stS with a 14-day unbonding period. Alternatively, they can trade stS directly on any of the following DEXs:\n\n* [Odos](https://www.odos.xyz/)\n* [Beets](https://beets.fi/swap/sonic/0xeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee)\n* [Shadow](https://www.shadow.so/trade)\n\nCurrent exchange rate as of 2/28/25: 1 stS = 1.0113 S\n\n### Security Considerations\n\nSecurity is at the forefront of stS operations. Beets Staked Sonic was launched in December 2024, with its contracts originally audited by [Spearbit](https://cantina.xyz/portfolio/71a6f59b-7533-4ae9-87c5-d1d1bf6d675a), and then further audited by [Trail of Bits](https://github.com/trailofbits/publications/blob/master/reviews/2025-01-beethovenx-sonicstaking-securityreview.pdf) in January. Beets maintains an Immunefi bug bounty of up to $200,000.\n\nRegarding Oracles stS currently integrates a Redstone, Pyth, and Stork stS/S price feed, with a Api3 and Chainlink Oracle integration currently being worked on. Aave will use a CAPO oracle leveraging chainlink's infrastructure.\n\n### Beets in numbers\n\nBeets Staked Sonic has seen continuous growth since launching on December 16th 2024, with 138.65m S and $86.20m currently staked within the protocol.\n\n![image](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/H1EhcSyskx.png)\n\nBeets Staked Sonic is growing at a steady rate and is currently the number one spot by TVL on [Defillama](https://defillama.com/protocols/Liquid%20Staking/Sonic) for LST projects on Sonic, with over 3.4x as much TVL as the second largest protocol:\n\n![image](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rJdqJU1jkx.png)\n\nBeets also runs a DEX on Sonic, resulting in it being the 2nd largest source of TVL across [all protocols](https://defillama.com/chain/Sonic) on Sonic:\n\n![image](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HJQLgUksyg.png)\n\n### Points program\n\nDue to both the underlying exposure to APR (currently ~5%), and the current Sonic points program which offers 4x passive points and 8x activity points on stS, S borrows vs stS have a seen continuous growth with users seeking efficient means to leverage capital.\n\n![image](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/B1vk9U1okx.png)\n\nBeing the largest LST on the network, stS is integrated into a variety of protocol verticals, including DEXs, Vaults, Yield Tokenization, and Lending markets:\n\n* [Spectra](https://app.spectra.finance/pools/sonic:0xb2b0b641af3efbb495837323f74d962c534c1f51)\n* [Shadow](https://www.shadow.so/liquidity)\n* [Beefy](https://app.beefy.com/)\n* [Stability](https://stability.farm/vaults/vault/146/0x709833e5b4b98aab812d175510f94bc91cfabd89)\n* [Vicuna](https://vicunafinance.com/vaults)\n* [Silo v2](https://v2.silo.finance/)\n* [Euler](https://app.euler.finance/vault/0x2De851E60e428106fC98fE94017466F8D71793d1?network=sonic)\n* [Stablejack](https://app.stablejack.xyz/markets/stS/token?name=yield)\n\n### Benefits of listing Beets Staked Sonic\n\nAdding lending and borrowing support for stS on Aave would allow users to supply, borrow, and leverage Sonic’s flagship LST.\n\nA dedicated stS market on Aave’s Sonic deployment would drive meaningful TVL growth and generate additional revenue for the Aave DAO through active S loans and liquidations. This integration would also position Aave as the go-to venue for risk-adjusted capital efficiency, enabling advanced looping strategies while providing exposure to Sonic points.\n\nIt’s worth noting that Beets also operates a DEX on Sonic, powered by Balancer technology. Beets contributors operate as technical Service Providers to the Balancer DAO and have played a key role in the development and deployment of [100% Boosted Pools](https://www.theblock.co/post/330379/balancer-v3-launches-aave), which have successfully re-hypothicated over [$50M](https://balancer.fi/pools?poolTags=BOOSTED) in liquidity to Aave.\n\nWith the launch of Aave on Sonic, Beets will deploy Aave Boosted Pools, creating a highly efficient mechanism for simultaneously growing Aave’s supply-side liquidity and strengthening Sonic Swap markets.\n\nAlongside stablecoin liquidity such as USDC.e, scUSD and GHO, an stS | S Boosted Pool would likely see strong adoption from Sonic users—helping bootstrap supply while keeping borrowing costs low in leverage markets.\n\n### Proof of Liquidity (POL) and Deposit Commitments\n\nAs mentioned, Beets can deploy Aave Boosted Pools to help seed Aave’s capital markets on Sonic. While Beets would not directly supply stS or S POL to Aave, it would deposit POL from the DAO treasury into these pools, effectively routing 100% of capital straight to Aave.\n\nAdditionally, Beets is in discussions with Sonic Money Managers regarding the bootstrapping of the stS market through stS <> S looping strategies, as well as Boosted Pool POL deposits. Specific amounts will be determined in collaboration with the Aave team and the ACI, with further details to be shared during the ARFC stage of the proposal process.\n\nRisk Parameters will be provided by Risk Services Providers at the earliest possible and ARFC will be updated with that feedback.\n\n### Useful links\n\n* [Beets Website](https://beets.fi/)\n* [Beets Staked Sonic](https://beets.fi/stake)\n* [stS Analytics](https://dune.com/beetsfi/staked-sonic)\n* [Docs](https://docs.beets.fi/)\n* [Github](https://github.com/beethovenxfi/)\n* [Beets Staked Sonic Contract](https://sonicscan.org/token/0xe5da20f15420ad15de0fa650600afc998bbe3955)\n* [Spearbit Audit](https://cantina.xyz/portfolio/71a6f59b-7533-4ae9-87c5-d1d1bf6d675a)\n* [Trail Of Bits Audit](https://github.com/trailofbits/publications/blob/master/reviews/2025-01-beethovenx-sonicstaking-securityreview.pdf)\n* [Blog](https://beetsfi.medium.com/)\n* [Discord](http://beets.fi/discord)\n* [Twitter](https://x.com/beets_fi)\n\n# Disclosure\n\nThe ACI is not directly affiliated with Beets and did not receive compensation for creation this proposal.\n\n# Next Steps\n\n1.

In addition, rsETH depositors into Aave will accumulate additional [Kelp miles](https://www.kelpdao.xyz/dashboard/) and EigenLayer points.\n\n### **Motivation**\n\n**KelpDAO** (https://www.kelpdao.xyz/restake/) is one of the largest liquid restaking protocol built on top of the Eigen Layer. Restakers on Kelp get access to multiple benefits like restaking rewards, staking rewards and DeFi yields.\n\n**Latest stats**:\n\n- USD 800 Mn+ (~270k Eth) TVL\n- 20K+ restakers onboarded\n- Accepts ETHx, stETH, sfrxETH, and Native ETH as collateral\n- Live across mainnet and L2s such as Arbitrum and Polygon zkEVM\n\nKelpDAO has undergone multiple security audits by top tier audit firms including Sigma Prime, Code4rena. More about KelpDAO’s security here: [Kelp DAO Audit reports](https://kelp.gitbook.io/kelp/audits).\n\nThe motivation for this proposal is to introduce a new asset class LRT (Liquid restaking tokens) to Aave and add to the diversity of LST/ LRT category.\n\n**Restaking Innovation**\n\nKelpDAO’s innovation in the restaking ecosystem has been focused on bringing about the following benefits to users and services-\n\n- Restakers\n    - Liqudity for restaked assets (stETH, ETHx, sfrxETH and Native ETH)\n    - Access to additional staking rewards\n    - Participate in DeFi using rsETH\n- AVSs\n    - Bootstrap economic security\n    - Lowered incentive spends\n- Operators\n    - Higher revenue earning potential\n    - Service onboarding and community support\n    - Marketing for node delegation\n\n### Specification\n\n*> Risk Parameters have been provided by Risk Service Providers on 2024-08-09 and ARFC has been updated.* It is recommended listing rsETH using an exchange rate oracle. \n\n\n| Parameter | Value |\n| --- | --- |\n| Isolation Mode | No |\n| Borrowable | Yes |\n| Collateral Enabled | Yes |\n| Supply Cap | 19,000 |\n| Borrow Cap | 1,900 |\n| Debt Ceiling | - |\n| LTV | 72% |\n| LT | 75% |\n| Liquidation Penalty | 7.5% |\n| Liquidation Protocol Fee | 10.00% |\n| Variable Base | 0.0% |\n| Variable Slope1 | 7.00% |\n| Variable Slope2 | 300.00% |\n| Uoptimal | 45.00% |\n| Reserve Factor | 15.00% |\n| Stable Borrowing | Disabled |\n| Flashloanable | Yes |\n| Siloed Borrowing | No |\n| Borrowable in Isolation | No |\n| E-Mode Category | ETH-Correlated |\n\n### CAPO\n\n| maxYearlyRatioGrowthPercent | ratioReferenceTime | MINIMUM_SNAPSHOT_DELAY |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 9.83% | monthly | 14 days |\n\n\nDetailed explanation on Kelp’s technical architecture - [Technical Architecture - Kelp](https://kelp.gitbook.io/kelp/technical-architecture)\n\nKelpDAO will have its own token $Kelp that will be the main governance token of Kelp protocol. Kelp token holders will be able to participate in governance related matters including Whitelisting/ delisting of Assets, Node operators, AVS’, setting and updating fees for Kelp protocol.\n\nKelp’s on-chain stats can be viewed on [Dune](https://dune.com/kelp_dao/dashboard-catalogue).\n\n**Liquidity Pools for rsETH**\n\nFollowing are liquidity stats for rsETH:\n\n- rsETH has >55 Mn USD liquidity across several DEXs on the mainnet including\n    - [Balancer](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0x58aadfb1afac0ad7fca1148f3cde6aedf5236b6d00000000000000000000067f) - $38 Mn\n    - [Uniswap V3](https://app.uniswap.org/explore/pools/ethereum/0x059615EBf32C946aaab3D44491f78e4F8e97e1D3) - $12.42 Mn\n    - [Balancer](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0x7761b6e0daa04e70637d81f1da7d186c205c2ade00000000000000000000065d) - $5 Mn\n    - Few others\n- ~$10 Mn+ average daily trading volume (Last 7 days on 12th May)\n\n**Oracles**:\n\nrsETH is supported by Chainlink and Redstone oracles. Posted links below to the Oracle contracts:\n\nChainlink calculated price feed: https://etherscan.io/address/0x78C12ccE8346B936117655Dd3D70a2501Fd3d6e6\n\nChainlink market feed: https://data.chain.link/feeds/ethereum/mainnet/rseth-eth\n\nRedstone market feed:\n\n[https://app.redstone.finance/tokens#/app/token/rsETH\\\\\\\\ETH](https://app.redstone.finance/tokens#/app/token/rsETH%5C%5C%5C%5CETH)\n\n**rsETH exchange rate mechanism:**\n\nrsETH exchange rate is defined based on the underlying assets and rewards generated by those assets.\n\nAccepted assets include ETH, stETH, ETHx, sfrxETH.\n\nExchange rate calculation -\n\nA → Total ETH + Staking rewards accumulated from the chain\n\nB → [Amount of ETHx] * [Value of 1 ETHx in ETH]\n\nC → [Amount of sfrxETH] * [Value of 1 sfrxETH in ETH]\n\nD → [Amount of stETH] * [Value of 1 stETH in ETH]\n\nE → Total supply of rsETH\n\nExchange rate (rsETH / ETH) = [A + B + C + D] / E\n\n**Withdrawals and risks**\n\nPrior to this ARFC, the only way to exit rsETH was via DEXs. \n\nNevertheless, KelpDAO users can now unstake rsETH, with an unbonding period of 7 to 8 days, due to Eigenlayer withdrawal period. That also means that any of the LST’s including stETH, ETHx or sfrxETH from Eigenlayer can be unstaked as well.\n\n### Proof of Liquidity and Deposit Commitments:\n\nAnyone who deposits rsETH into Aave will accumulate additional [Kelp miles](https://www.kelpdao.xyz/dashboard/) and EigenLayer points.\n\n### **Useful Links:**\n\n* [KelpDAO’s Dapp](https://www.kelpdao.xyz/)\n* Contract Address:[ 0xA1290d69c65A6Fe4DF752f95823fae25cB99e5A7](https://etherscan.io/token/0xA1290d69c65A6Fe4DF752f95823fae25cB99e5A7)\n* [GitHub Docs](https://kelp.gitbook.io/kelp)\n\n### Disclaimer:\n\nThis proposal is powered by Skywards.

        "body": "---\nTitle: [ARFC] Onboard ggAVAX to Aave V3 on Avalanche \nDate: 2024-04-29\nAuthor: ACI (Aave-chan Initiative)\n---\n\n## Summary:\n\nThe current proposal is set to add ggAVAX, a liquid staking AVAX token issued by the Gogopool protocol, to the AAVE V3 Avalanche market.\n\n### Motivation\n\nGoGoPool is one of the largest Avalanche DeFi protocols. It is ranked number 6 on the Avalanche C-Chain in terms of TVL chain and currently controls more than 500k AVAX (~$23M at current market prices).\n\nWe believe there is currently very large underserved demand for borrowing AVAX against ggAVAX, as ggAVAX is the highest-yielding LST on Avalanche. The APYs currently range between 7% and 8%, which is on the order of 33% more yield than any existing competitors on Avalanche. \n\nBeing the highest-yielding LST on Avalanche makes ggAVAX perfect for being a collateral asset, especially for those who seek leveraged exposure to native AVAX yields.\n\n \n![dd93fbd27bc1aac727035529eb5ff6253f57edc8.png](ipfs://bafkreibcfworgked4rc5maanvobvklqy6rmwchfk7rjyoswvyd2chpzsbu)\n    \n\n\nThis yield is achieved through a mix of no protocol fees, running validators instead of utilizing delegation mechanisms, and generating MEV yield from positive market interactions (see dashboard for more details: [Flipside](https://flipsidecrypto.xyz/GoGoPool/ggp-protocol-stats-PitGzK)). \n\nThere is currently more than ~80k AVAX in the ggAVAX-AVAX pools across Balancer and Wombat, making it the most liquid Avalanche LST relative to its size.\n\n \n![8867ec44b2d0dc326eaf4b928b7d7c889eb5f113.png](ipfs://bafkreig3f2xualvcqedjubvgg66tj3jwfkccocvm53l5dc5xtmmo6r5px4)\n    \n\n\nBesides the deep on-chain liquidity, ggAVAX allows users to redeem ggAVAX for underlying AVAX at an internal rate and with no fees. These redemptions are instant as long as there is enough AVAX in the ggAVAX smart contract to facilitate them.\n\nGoGoPool is backed by the Avalanche Foundation and industry-leading investors. In 2022, It raised $7.5M in two rounds [led by Framework Ventures and Coinfund and](https://www.theblock.co/post/166498/gogopool-raises-5-million-to-provide-decentralized-staking-on-avalanche?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social) with participation from Silverstone Ventures, Fintech Collective, and Avalaunch. \n\nThe protocol has been [audited by Zellic](https://github.com/Zellic/publications/blob/master/GoGoPool%20-%20Zellic%20Audit%20Report.pdf) and [Kudelski Security](https://assets-global.website-files.com/62f90a8443126c2ee50f4c4e/643ee88bf91b375b39ba2613_Kudelski_multisig_labs_report_1.1.pdf) with an additional [Code4rena](https://docs.gogopool.com/audits/code4rena-audit) audit contest. It also has an ongoing [bug bounty program with Immunefi](https://immunefi.com/bounty/gogopool/).\n\n### Benefits of listing ggAVAX\n\nListing of ggAVAX on AAVE would create additional demand for borrowing AVAX (in E-Mode) and other assets. Since ggAVAX generates consistently higher yields than other LSTs, borrowers can tolerate higher interest payments, leading to AVAX utilisation and revenue for the DAO.\n\nCurrently, AVAX utilisation sits well below the Optimal Utilisation Rate. More than $30M in borrow demand is required to bring utilisation from 43% to 65%. Listing a new high-yielding LST as collateral will help create this additional borrowing demand, resulting in higher utilisation rates, higher APRs for AVAX lenders and higher income for the  AAVE Ecosystem Reserve. \n\n### Chain to be deployed/listed\n\nAave V3 on Avalanche.\n\n### Technical Details\n\nWith the recent implementation of [Price Cap Adapters (CAPO)](https://app.aave.com/governance/v3/proposal/?proposalId=51), ggAVAX can be listed using an internal rate oracle without relying only on the AVAX/USD ChainLink price feed. This is the same approach that AAVE currently uses for sAVAX, wstETH, cbETH, weETH and other LSTs (and LRTs)\n\nggAVAX’s CAPO, however, might require a max growth ratio higher than the 10.1% currently set for sAVAX to account for a generally higher level of yield.\n\nWe welcome any questions about ggAVAX architecture and protocol structure and look forward to working on this with the DAO.\n\n### Specification\n\n|Parameter|Value|\n|---|---|\n|Isolation Mode|No|\n|Borrowable|No|\n|Collateral Enabled|Yes|\n|Supply Cap (ggAVAX)|70,000|\n|Borrow Cap (ggAVAX)|NA|\n|Debt Ceiling|NA|\n|LTV|30.00%|\n|LT|40.00%|\n|Liquidation Bonus|10.00%|\n|Liquidation Protocol Fee|10.00%|\n|Variable Base|0.0%|\n|Variable Slope1|NA|\n|Variable Slope2|NA|\n|Uoptimal|NA|\n|Reserve Factor|NA|\n|Stable Borrowing|Disabled|\n|Flashloanable|Yes|\n|Siloed Borrowing|No|\n|Borrowed in Isolation|No|\n|Emode|No|\n\n\n### Proof of Liquidity (POL)  and Deposit Commitments\n\nGoGoPool has earmarked 10k GGP tokens (worth +100K USD at average 90-day prices) for incentivising ggAVAX deposits into AAVE over the first three months of the listing to help bootstrap the market adoption and attract leverage takers.\n\nAfter the listing is complete, we plan to work tightly with Avalanche ecosystem partners to integrate the market into their products. This can include autocompounding vaults, composite strategies and auto-leverage vaults. \n\nThese and other integrations would help drive usage to the ggAVAX market specifically and AAVE in general. Note that we have already had preliminary talks with a number of protocols on this subject.\n\n### Useful Links\n\n[Website](https://www.gogopool.com/) \n\n[Github](https://github.com/multisig-labs/)\n\n[Flipside](https://flipsidecrypto.xyz/GoGoPool/ggp-protocol-stats-PitGzK) \n\n[Twitter](https://twitter.com/gogopool_)\n\n[Docs](https://docs.gogopool.com/)\n\n### Disclaimer\n\nThis proposal is powered by Skywards.

        "body": "## Title: [ARFC] Onboard STONE to Aave V3 on Scroll\n\n## Author: ACI\n\n## Date: 2024-09-02\n\n---\n\n### **Summary**\n\nStakeStone is the protocol issuing STONE, the liquid ETH, with over 150k users. Currently, StakeStone is seeking support to onboard STONE to Aave V3 on Scroll and is launching a series of initiatives to boost liquidity and Aave adoption.\n\n### **Motivation/Background**\n\nSTONE is an ERC-20 rebalancing token that generates risk-free rewards for ETH based on blue-chip underlying assets like Lido, EigenLayer, and Symbiotic in a decentralized manner through our OPAP governance mechanism. StakeStone currently has $350 million worth of STONE deployed on Scroll. To ensure that STONE has robust liquidity, in addition to the STONE-ETH DEX liquidity on Scroll, STONE also has PMM powered cross-chain liquidity. Users can perform cross-chain redemption and receive ETH on the Ethereum mainnet within 40 seconds, with optimized pricing.\n\nSTONE aims to become the liquid ETH, covering users’ opportunity costs while creating more use cases for STONE holders. Thanks to its architecture supporting multiple underlying assets, STONE can maintain market adaptability and stability over the long term, allowing users and the protocol to avoid the need to mint or integrate a new asset.\n\n**Benefits of listing STONE token:**\n\nSTONE is collaborating with Scroll to build a DeFi ecosystem. STONE works closely with various protocols to support the ecosystem and facilitate their go-to-market strategies. Currently, STONE is the largest asset category on Scroll, accounting for over 30% of the total TVL across the chain, with a high utilization rate (close to 90%). The StakeStone team is dedicated to offering services to protocols that support STONE while fostering collaboration for shared prosperity, which is reflected in the high utilization of STONE across various DeFi use cases.\n\n**Market Impact:**\n\nAs of today, over 180,000 ETH have been staked in StakeStone, with a historical high of 340,000 ETH. StakeStone has also successfully processed nearly 1 billion dollars in inflows and outflows. Meanwhile, STONE has a wide user base, and all users are very active on-chain. We hope that this active community can bring more liquidity and activity to AAVE.\n\n### **Chain to be deployed/listed:**\n\nScroll chain. Scroll grew to become the top zk rollup in terms of TVL and shows continued strength in community and volume.\n\n### **Proof of Liquidity (POL) and Deposit Commitments**\n\nStakeStone has collaborations with external parties to bootstrap liquidity for a more robust and diverse liquidity environment at AAVE. Large liquidity providers are highly interested in using STONE in AAVE and further boosting DEX liquidity for STONE. StakeStone will also have its own liquidity mining incentive campaign for STONE in AAVE.\n\nTo incentivize the use of STONE in AAVE, StakeStone will provide boosted STONE points for STONE suppliers and is planning a yield-boost campaign specifically designed to maximize engagement.\n\nAmong our active liquidity providers, we have gathered strong interest in using STONE for lending and borrowing. The team will actively engage with liquidity providers to achieve a supply of at least 5,000 STONE, gradually increasing it over time as risk parameters are adjusted.\n\n### Specification\n\nFollowing analysis from Chaos Labs, the recommend the following parameter settings are:\n\n| **Parameter** | **Value** |\n| --- | --- |\n| Isolation Mode | No |\n| Borrowable | Yes |\n| Collateral Enabled | Yes |\n| Supply Cap | 4,800 |\n| Borrow Cap | 480 |\n| Debt Ceiling | - |\n| LTV | 72.5% |\n| LT | 75% |\n| Liquidation Bonus | 7.5% |\n| Liquidation Protocol Fee | 10.00% |\n| Variable Base | 0.00% |\n| Variable Slope1 | 7.00% |\n| Variable Slope2 | 300.00% |\n| Uoptimal | 45.00% |\n| Reserve Factor | 15.00% |\n| Stable Borrowing | Disabled |\n| Flashloanable | Yes |\n| Siloed Borrowing | No |\n| Borrowable in Isolation | No |\n| E-Mode Category | N/A |\n\n### Other relevant information\n\nSTONE has undergone multiple rounds of audits conducted by firms such as Quantstamp, Slowmist, Veridise, and Secure3, and closely collaborates with security organizations like Cobo and Coincover.\n\n### **Useful Links**\n\n[Dune Analytics for data about STONE](https://dune.com/HolyMoon/stakestone)\n\n[Security audits](https://docs.stakestone.io/stakestone/additionals/audits-and-security)\n\n[Governance votes about asset](https://app.stakestone.io/u/portfolio-allocation/vote/vote-list)\n\n[OPAP proposal example](https://x.com/Stake_Stone/status/1772286551340286261)\n\n### **Disclaimer**\n\nThis proposal is powered by Skywards.

        "body": "# [TEMP CHECK]: Add support for Wrapped Origin Sonic (wOS) to Aave v3\n\nAuthor: Peter from the Origin Protocol core team\n\nDate: 2025-02-04\n\n**1. Simple Summary**\n\nIn response to the Temp Check and recently passed ARFC [proposal](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-deploy-aave-v3-on-sonic/20543/15) of deploying Sonic markets on Aave, this is a proposal for adding supply/borrow support for wOS on the Aave Sonic Instance.\n\n**2. Motivation/Background**\n\n[Origin Sonic ](https://www.originprotocol.com/super-oeth)(OS) was launched in January 2025 and is an ERC20 LST that generates yield while sitting in your wallet by delegating S to a node operator. Similar to stETH, OS yield is paid out daily and automatically (sometimes multiple times per day) through a positive rebase in the form of additional OS, proportional to the amount of OS held.\n\nSeveral LSTs trade below their peg due to DEX fees and slippage, and to reflect the time value of money. LSTs that consistently trade below peg effectively impose a hidden exit fee - certain LSTs often trade ~0.25% below peg, meaning it takes three weeks of staking to break even. This may be ok for long-term holders, but is terrible for users who plan to loop LTSs for additional yield. This was not the case for OETH or superOETHb, and will not be the case with OS.\n\n\nUsing OS on Aave will produce higher yield than other supported Sonic LSTs and have a near perfect S peg. The coming OS AMO will strengthen the peg, increase capital efficiency, and maximize yield. Our vision for OS is for it to become the most trusted LST for those seeking to use an LST for leveraged staking on Aave's coming Sonic instance.\n\n\nObtaining OS is effortless, users can convert their S into Origin Sonic via any of the following methods:\n\n* Minting on the [Origin Sonic dapp](https://originprotocol.eth.limo/#/OS)\n* Swapping on [SwapX](https://sonicscan.org/address/0xa76Beaf111BaD5dD866fa4835D66b9aA2Eb1FdEc)\n* Swapping on [Equalizer](https://sonicscan.org/address/0x99ff9d3E8B26Fea85a7a103D9e576EfdC38fB530)\n\nwOS is a ERC-4626 tokenized vault designed to accrue yield in price rather than in quantity. When you wrap OS, you get back a fixed number of wOS tokens. This number will not go up - you will have the same number of wOS tokens tomorrow as you have today. However, the number of OS tokens that you can unwrap to will go up over time, as wOS earns yield at the same rate as standard OS. The wOS to OS exchange rate can be read from the [contract](https://sonicscan.org/address/0x9F0dF7799f6FDAd409300080cfF680f5A23df4b1) (function number 16), or via the OS [dapp](https://originprotocol.eth.limo/#/os/).\n\nCurrent exchange rate as of 2/04/25: 1 wOS = 1.00614219 OS\n\n*Security Considerations*\n\nOS was launched in January 2025 with 95% of its code forked from[ OUSD](https://docs.originprotocol.com/protocol/ousd), which has been the basis of our other yield-bearing tokens OETH and Super OETH as well. This allows OS to inherit years of top-tier audits and a proven track record of securing hundreds of millions of dollars worth of underlying collateral. All OS audits can be found in the [audits section ](https://docs.originprotocol.com/security-and-risk/audits) of the OS docs. We have recently retained [yAudit](https://yaudit.dev/) to look at our PRs as we code, and OpenZeppelin is also held on retainer to review 100% of the OETH and OUSD smart contract changes. Origin maintains an active bug bounty with rewards ranging in size from $100 OUSD for minor issues to $1,000,000 OUSD for major critical vulnerabilities. The bug bounty program is currently administered by [Immunefi](https://immunefi.com/bounty/origindefi/), where Origin maintains a median resolution time of 6 hours.\n\nWe are in talks with Chainlink, Redstone, Pyth, and API3 about deploying an OS/S price feed, but the redemption rate of OS to S can also be used to derive the price of OS on chain (OS redemptions back to S are currently available and were available at launch). Origin Sonic likely qualifies for a Correlated-Asset Price Oracle (CAPO) based on [similar LSTs ](https://governance.aave.com/t/update-on-correlated-price-asset-onboarding/17012) that have qualified.\n\n\n\n*Performance*\n\nOrigin Sonic has seen healthy growth since launching on January 14th of 2025. [Proof of Yield](https://analytics.originprotocol.com/os/poy) tracks the distribution of each Origin Sonic rebase event and displays the compounded yield on an annualized basis each day. The [current](https://analytics.originprotocol.com/os/) Origin Sonic TVL sits at $2.6m (5.2m S) with a native yield of 17.69% APY:\n\n![Screenshot 2025-02-04 at 3.16.16 PM.png](ipfs://bafkreie65wbbgzwltseienwdm263bx5vt53wecutb7ov4ukfvhb5iyrxkm)\n\n\nOrigin Sonic is growing at a steady rate and is currently the number two spot by TVL on [Defillama](https://defillama.com/protocols/Liquid%20Staking/Sonic) for LST projects on Sonic:\n\n![Screenshot 2025-02-04 at 3.17.23 PM.png](ipfs://bafkreigmlxeiohiaemgzxff7o2xijl63ga7262qmyvf75ueu3tkuwvc6zy)\n\nand is the number 11 spot for [all protocols](https://defillama.com/chain/Sonic) on Sonic:\n![Screenshot 2025-02-04 at 3.17.49 PM.png](ipfs://bafkreihqdks3ahavk4dlew3vkjt6fdxoob4mcutzakdjzrefcqypiliqga)\n\nThere has been immense demand for borrowing S against OS for leverage looping on money markets since launch due to the high underlying OS APY, and since OS and wOS earn 2x Passive Points and 4x Active Points (8x total points) when used in Defi protocols. \n![Screenshot 2025-02-04 at 3.20.25 PM.png](ipfs://bafkreievxe4ghhtlqufhpywoa2f7h4gfstzatheafsq363mqyp6x5ao2oy)\n\nOrigin has managed to integrate and onboard Origin Sonic into a variety of protocol verticals, including vaults, perps, and money markets:\n\n- [Spectra](https://app.spectra.finance/pools/sonic:0x480d702d7a887e22d35917a320057388a7a5d096)\n- [Beefy](https://app.beefy.com/)\n- [Stability](https://stability.farm/vaults)\n- [Vicuna](https://vicunafinance.com/vaults)\n- [Enclab](https://www.enclabs.finance/#/?chainId=146)\n- [Silo v2](https://v2.silo.finance/markets/sonic/wos-s-22)\n- [Lynx](https://app.lynx.finance/pools?chainId=146&sa=s)\n\n**Benefits of listing Origin Sonic**\n\n[Since 2021](https://etherscan.io/address/0x5e3646a1db86993f73e6b74a57d8640b69f7e259), Origin has streamed millions of dollars in stablecoin to Aave markets via OUSD strategies, generating millions in yield and significantly boosting Aave’s TVL.\n\nEnabling lend and borrow support for wOS on Aave will provide a new market for OS holders and Origin Protocol users, and add a new platform for leverage looping S. This new Origin Sonic market would lead to additional increased TVL for Aave’s new Sonic instance, additional revenue to the Aave Protocol and DAO from active loans and liquidations, and will attract a wider user base due to Origin Sonic being significantly higher yielding over the other Sonic LSTs that have launched.\n\n**Proof of Liquidity (POL) and Deposit Commitments**\n\nWhile no incentives have been used within any Origin Sonic integrations due to the high native yield of Origin Sonic, the Origin Protocol team is open to providing seed liquidity to jumpstart the Origin Sonic market on Aave once wOS is onboarded. More accurate amounts will be discussed with the Aave team and the ACI and can be shared during the ARFC stage of the proposal process.\n\n**3.
