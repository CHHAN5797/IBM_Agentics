This proposal aims to extend the technical services and advisory component for an additional 6 months (January 1, 2025 - June 30, 2025). As in the previous proposals, marketing services provided by the Beethoven X DAO are submitted as a separate proposal. Our primary roles include API team lead (franzns), frontend contributor (groninge) and ecosystem technical lead (daniel). Additionally, we’d like to apologize for the delay in posting this proposal. The launch of v3 took precedence and we were unable to allocate enough time and resource to prepare our proposal before the end of year cut-off.\n\nAs we operate as a small part of a much larger system, our successes are enabled by many across the ecosystem. As such, we present a broad technical ecosystem update below that touches on our specific contributions when relevant. We welcome community feedback.\n\n### Off-chain Infrastructure (Subgraph / SDK / UI / API)\n\nThe release of the [Zen UI](https://balancer.fi/), the launch of [CoW AMM](https://medium.com/balancer-protocol/cow-amm-the-next-frontier-of-amm-innovation-1718842ad066), and the official launch of [Balancer v3](https://medium.com/balancer-protocol/balancer-v3-is-live-2e5e8462aa4c)—all within the past 6 months—has showcased just how far Balancer’s off-chain infrastructure has come. Leveraging years of collective experience, we’ve spent the last 18 months systematically identifying key bottle necks across the entire off-chain stack, iterating, refactoring, and rebuilding where necessary. It is because of this foundational effort that we are positioned and ready to scale as v3 gains market adoption, attracts builders, and new types of AMMs emerge.\n\nBelow, we present a highlight list of some of the bigger milestones and interesting initiatives from the last six months:\n\n- **Zen UI** - The Zen UI has redefined the Balancer user experience, receiving significant praise across the broader DeFI ecosystem. It is multi-chain native, blazing fast, beautifully designed offering an intuitive UX, built to be version and pool type agnostic, partner themeable and Aura aware.\n- **SDK** - With the [b-sdk](https://github.com/balancer/b-sdk) now feature-complete for both v2 and v3, the [balancer-sdk](https://github.com/balancer/balancer-sdk) was officially deprecated in November 2024. The b-sdk is significantly simpler than its predecessor, with it’s primary goal being to facilitate on-chain interactions with the Balancer Protocol. Data intensive operations are now delegated to the Balancer API. We expect  the b-sdk to have significantly reduced maintenance requirements, ensuring that the SDK team will have ample time to manage new pool type integrations and transition a significant amount of energy into supporting developer teams as they build on top of and integrate against balancer v3.\n- **Subgraph** - The simplicity of the v3 subgraph is it’s defining feature. What was once a monolith of business and pricing logic has transitioned to a simple data extraction and indexing layer, making it less error prone and significantly easier to maintain. This transition has removed the largest bottleneck in our data pipeline and has freed up the data team to work on high value initiatives across the ecosystem.\n- **API** - With the release of the Zen UI, the API became the defacto data layer for all Balancer applications. It stitches together data from disparate sources both internal and external, providing rich, simple and easy to parse data models. Considering the breadth of integrations managed by the API, we have seen very few issues, zero down time and consistent infrastructure cost reductions.\n\nA hugely positive side effect of the reduced complexity across our tech stack is that we are able to free up resource to work on high value initiatives:\n\n- **Prototyping** - An idea initially proposed by @zendragon, John Grant led the first implementation of the [StableSurgeHook](https://github.com/balancer/balancer-v3-monorepo/blob/main/pkg/pool-hooks/contracts/StableSurgeHook.sol), a hook that we’re looking to launch in early Q1 2024. Additionally, he tested a design pattern for applying non-fungible metadata to balancer positions combining [Custom Routers with Hooks](https://johngrant.medium.com/unlocking-the-power-of-balancer-v3-exploring-hooks-and-custom-routers-3c2f40440fcc).\n- **Volume hit squad** - Volume will be a key metric by which the success of v3 is measured. @mendesfabio and John have formed a sub-team with the core focus of meaningfully improving Balancer’s volume and ensuring products built on Balancer are integrated into the aggregator and solver ecosystem.\n\n### CoW AMM\n\nLaunched in August 2024, CoW AMM represents a significant innovation for the Balancer ecosystem. Developed in collaboration with CoW Swap and implemented by Wonderland, it stands as the first MEV-capturing AMM in the market. CoW AMMs protects LPs from LVR so they can provide liquidity with less risk and higher return. By leveraging the CoW Swap solver network, CoW AMMs overcome the common cold start problem faced by novel AMMs, ensuring immediate trading volume from day one. Its direct integration into the Balancer Zen UI provides users with a fast, reliable, and familiar user experience, showcasing the value proposition of building on Balancer. \n\nAs of Jan 2025, CoW AMMs are live on 4 networks (mainnet, gnosis, base, arbitrum), boast over $25 million in TVL and have captured over $75 million in volume. With CoW AMMs capturing mind share, they have reignited the narrative of innovation being built on Balancer, attracting more developers and users to the ecosystem.\n\n### Balancer v3\n\nAfter more than 18 months of dedicated effort across the entire ecosystem, v3 officially launched on December 11th. With a 10x improvement to Custom Pool DX, native support for yield-bearing tokens, 100% Boosted Pools, and re-entrant pool lifecycle hooks enabling unprecedented flexibility, Balancer is set to solidify its role as the go-to base layer for custom pool innovation, fuelling the next generation of AMM design and driving the evolution of the on-chain economy.\n\nWhile the list is long and the contributions many, we highlight a few of the larger technical milestones achieved during the last six months below:\n\n- Public [code release](https://github.com/balancer/balancer-v3-monorepo) in July, along with [docs](https://docs.balancer.fi/) and [technical article](https://medium.com/balancer-protocol/balancer-v3-the-future-of-amm-innovation-f8f856040122) describing the core features and improvements for v3\n- The v3 contracts were audited by three separate audit firms, funded entirely by Balancer Labs. All audit reports are available in the [v3-monorepo](https://github.com/balancer/balancer-v3-monorepo/tree/main/audits).\n- The [DAO funded](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-713-spearbit-cantina-audit-competition-funding/6034) the prize pool for a public [Cantina competition](https://x.com/Balancer/status/1869680010208186723) starting in November\n- The Grants committee organized and executed on the [Balancer v3 Hookathon](https://dorahacks.io/hackathon/balancer-v3-hookathon/buidl), driving significant community engagement which resulted in over 30 submissions.\n- The [first aggregators](https://x.com/paraswap/status/1867186565266747454?s=46&t=8PLybUVnwKuuUzNvJPH8) launched support for v3 just days after it’s official launch\n\nAs a truly decentralized organization with multiple independent service providers collaborating to drive innovation and advance the Balancer protocol, the successful launch of v3 demonstrates the potential of the DAO working model. It has been an honor to collaborate with a team of dedicated experts across various technical and non-technical verticals in our collective efforts to bring v3 to market.\n\n## **Key Objectives & Success Metrics:**\n\nWith the successful launch of Balancer v3, we’d propose the following key objectives to guide technical resource allocation over the next two quarters:\n\n- **Support our partners** - As Fernando has said before: *Balancer’s long-term success is intrinsically linked to the success of the protocols and products built on our platform.* With v3 active development now wrapped, we as the technical teams within the balancer ecosystem need to shift our focus outwards, towards our partners. While several technical leads already do a great job engaging with partners, there is scope to increase participation across all teams. Over the next two quarters, we should cultivate an environment where individual contributors feel empowered and capable of assisting partners within their domain of expertise.\n- **Build on v3** - We believe the fastest path to building an engaged developer community around v3 will be to lead by example. We should continue to identify novel and interesting use cases and showcase how easy it is to build them on v3. The prototyping work kickstarted by John is a perfect example of this effort and something we double down on over the next two quarters.\n- **Work to get v3 integrated, wherever possible** - Balancer's flexibility, while powerful, has historically posed integration challenges. While v3 incorporates simple interfaces leveraging standard conventions wherever possible, there will undoubtedly be hurdles for integrators. For v3 to be successful, we must prioritize integrations, balancer’s v3 liquidity needs to be accessible in all major venues. Initiatives like the volume hit squad are a great step in the right direction, but collectively we can still do more.\n\n**Length of Engagement & Budget:**\n\nBeethoven X DAO is requesting 6 months of funding starting January 1, 2024 and ending June 30, 2024.\n\nWe request to extend the existing budget of 29,000 USDC per month for technical development and advisory.\n\nIn total our USDC cost basis breakdown looks as follows for 3 FTE:\n\n| **Position** | **Cost Basis** |\n| --- | --- |\n| $ / FTE / month (USDC) | $9,666.67 |\n\n**ETH Address to Receive Funds:** 0x811912c19eEF91b9Dc3cA52fc426590cFB84FC86",

This proposal aims to extend the technical services and advisory component for an additional 6 months (July 1, 2024 - December 31, 2024). As in the previous proposals, marketing services provided by the Beethoven X DAO are submitted as a separate proposal. Our primary roles include API team lead (@franzns), frontend contributor (groninge) and ecosystem technical lead (daniel). \n\n@Fernando's recent [post](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/balancer-v3-my-thoughts-for-the-future-of-balancer/5801) outlines a product vision for Balancer v3, a vision that all technical teams have spent the last six months working to build out. As we approach feature complete and prepare to release the codebase to the wider public, we move steadily closer to bringing v3 to market.\n\nThe following statement from our previous proposal remains as relevant today as it was six months ago:\n> The upcoming release of Balancer v3 presents an opportunity for Balancer to regain narrative and establish ourselves as the platform to empower current and future AMM innovation. We are hugely optimistic in the future of Balancer Protocol and steadfast in our dedication to support the ecosystem to the best of our abilities. As we work towards Balancer v3, it has been inspiring to participate in the development of a more cohesive technology stack to empower the future of the protocol. A technology stack that leverages the collective experiences and expertise of contributors across the ecosystem, avoiding siloed development strategies that lead to unnecessary system complexity in Balancer v2.\n\nAs we operate as a small part of a much larger system, our successes are enabled by many across the ecosystem. As such, we present a broad technical ecosystem update below that touches on our specific contributions when relevant. We welcome community feedback.\n\n**Integrations**\n\nAs of January 2024, Three Rocks wound down their operations and all responsibilities transitioned to Balancer Labs under the leadership of John Grant. Despite a reduction in team size, the new integrations team has proven themselves more than capable of stepping up to the challenge. Below is a list of the major initiatives and projects that the integrations team has taken on over the last six months:\n\n- **Rate provider reviews** - @Marcus and @Mkflow27 have successfully introduced a structured internal process to manage rate provider reviews that has created transparency, clear deadlines and improved turnaround time dramatically. The positive impact has been felt across the entire ecosystem.\n- **Aggregator / Solver relations** - The success of Balancer v3 will be tightly coupled to our ability to get v3 liquidity integrated into the broader liquidity landscape. @lipman and John Grant have spent the last several month building bridges to all aggregators and solvers in our network. Getting them early access to the v3 codebase and documentation, and doing whatever they can to ensure that v3 liquidity will have aggregator support from day one.\n- **V3 Docs** - While conducting extensive interviews with partners, documentation was identified as one of the weakest points of Balancer v2. The integrations team, lead by mkflow, has taken ownership over the v3 docs, and has invested significant energy to ensure that v3 will launch with robust documentation, with a focus on easy to use guides for integrators and builders.\n- **Balancer Maths** - A lightweight multi-language repository that will contain invariant implementations for all known Balancer pools. By providing invariant implementations in commonly used programming languages (typescript, python, rust), this repository will serve as a reference point for any teams that require off-chain computation of pool maths (ie: aggregators and solvers).\n- **Scaffold Balancer** - Funded as a grant in partnership with the [BuidlGuidl](https://buidlguidl.com/), Scaffold Balancer will serve as a toolkit for developers looking to build custom AMMs or Hooks on Balancer v3. Based on the popular [scaffold-eth](https://scaffoldeth.io/), Scaffold Balancer provides an interactive UI that allows developers to build, deploy and interact with custom AMMs and hooks. Our goal is for Balancer v3 to become the destination for AMM experimentation and innovation.\n\n**Smart Contracts**\n\nBalancer v3 has been the core focus of the Smart Contracts team for the entire last two quarters, and we are rapidly approaching feature complete. While an exact date has not been set, we expect to release the code base within the next 6 weeks, giving the general public an opportunity to provide feedback prior to freezing the code and starting formal audits. While the v3 development cycle has extended beyond what we had initially planned, the additional time was necessary to iterate on core features until we found an optimal solution.\n\nAs always, it has been a pleasure collaborating closely with @juani, @endymionjkb, @joaobrunoah and Elshan over the last six months. I think I can speak for the entire team when I say that we’re very much looking forward to sharing more details on Balancer v3 over the coming months.\n\n**SDK**\n\nThe new [b-sdk](https://github.com/balancer/b-sdk) is now feature complete for Balancer v2, with v3 support well underway and on track to be feature complete prior to v3 rollout. In contrast to the existing [Balancer SDK](https://github.com/balancer/balancer-sdk), the new b-sdk is highly focused on facilitating on-chain interactions with the Balancer Protocol. Data intensive operations are now delegated to the Balancer API, allowing the SDK to be focused in its goals. In line with that goal, the Smart Order Router (SOR) has been migrated from the SDK to the API, which can leverage data caching to ensure fresh quotes and fast response times. With the reduction in scope, the SDK team have already become active contributors to the API and will transition into supporting integrations in the mid-term.\n\n**Frontend**\n\nDubbed internally Project Zen, the new Balancer Frontend is undergoing active testing in a [closed beta](https://x.com/Balancer/status/1796274392739274806) prior to a public launch in early July. As a quick recap, the new Balancer Frontend is:\n\n- Multi-chain native to facilitate exploration of liquidity pools across all Balancer supported networks.\n- Statically rendered and API powered to enable blazing fast load times\n- Beautifully designed, adopting the new “Zen” themed rebrand that will be unveiled in the coming weeks.\n- Version agnostic, supporting all v2 pools with v3 support underway.\n- Designed with a flexible architecture, highlighted by it’s ability to easily support v2, v3 and the new CoW AMM pools\n\nLed by @gareth, OpCo and Beethoven X contributors have rebuilt the Balancer App from the ground up, leveraging their extensive Balancer domain knowledge to build a better product that will serve the ecosystem for the coming years.\n\n**Subgraph / Data**\n\nThe development of the v3 subgraph has continued in lock-step with the smart contracts. Led by @mendesfabio, the data team has done a great job of reducing the subgraph’s scope, migrating from a monolithic design that attempted to solve all problems, to a modular design focused primarily on data extraction. This revised approach allows the API to manage data transformation, providing a granular level of control that will result in improved data quality across the ecosystem.\n\nBy separating vault from pools, the modular approach to the v3 subgraph aims to reduce lengthy subgraph redeployments that have been bottlenecks to new pool type development on v2. Rather than redeploying a singular monolithic subgraph, a new pool type will only require the deployment of a pools subgraph that will be significantly lighter weight.\n\nTo support new pool type development by external teams, the data team has developed a CLI tool that will manage much of the scaffolding for developers when looking to include their newly developed pool types to the Balancer Pools Subgraph.\n\nOutside of subgraph development, the data team remains committed to the development of high quality dune dashboard and reusable spells, highlighted by the [Balancer dune org](https://dune.com/balancer) recently passing 1,000 stars. Additionally, the data team has been engaged with external data providers working to ensure the consistency of Balancer data across the broader ecosystem, and has begun engaging with Hypernative (SP) to ensure high quality system monitoring is in place for v3 launch.\n\n**API**\n\nBelow, we present general API updates, written by Beethoven X DAO contributor franz, API team lead:\n\nIn the first half of 2024, our main focus has been on enhancing the API and streamlining processes to meet the needs of the upcoming Zen UI and Balancer V3. We achieved several important milestones during this period.\n\nThe API is now ready to serve the needs of the new UI. We’ve worked closely with OpCo to ensure all their needs are satisfied. We continued to improve the new API on various fronts. For example, we restructured the database to support more historical data, including swaps, liquidity additions and removals, pool snapshots, and token pricing. This allows for more comprehensive data analysis and reporting. The new Smart Order Router has also been fully integrated now and improved order routing efficiency across the platform. Throughout these efforts, maintaining backward compatibility has been a priority to ensure uninterrupted service for existing users.\n\nOptimizing the allow listing process for tokens, pools, and gauges was another significant and important task. We’ve analyzed the current process end-to-end and were able to find several inefficiencies. The implementation of the new process has reduced manual work, making it more efficient and less error-prone for both Balancer Maxis as well as OpCo. This process will continue to be optimized with the new Balancer UI.\n\nAdditional integration efforts included adding support for COWAMM which is a new AMM primitive developed in partnership with Cow Swap. In addition, integration for the new Balancer Vault V3 has started and is progressing alongside the Smart Contract development. We also integrated Mode and Fraxtal to support the launch of Balancer on those networks.\n\nWe also reviewed and fixed the token terminal reporting of revenue for all Balancer chains, ensuring accurate financial reporting. Additionally, we worked with DEX Screener to integrate Balancer Pools properly into their App. Support is not yet live for all chains, but they are in the works.\n\n**Key Objectives & Success Metrics:**\n\n- **Make it easier to build on Balancer** - Having become domain experts on Balancer tech, Beethoven X collaborators are uniquely positioned to identify and help build solutions for many of the pain points that exist in the current Balancer tech stack.\n- **Reduce duplicate effort across the ecosystem** - How do we as an ecosystem invest significantly more energy into the future success of Balancer protocol and spend less time on the problems of today?\n- **Help drive the direction of the Balancer protocol** - We believe Balancer protocol should be a platform that empowers current and future AMM innovation. We will continue to work to align the various parties in the balancer ecosystem around this vision. How do we put a true focus on this goal? How do we empower developers to build the next generation of AMMs on Balancer protocol?\n\n**Length of Engagement & Budget:**\n\nBeethoven X DAO is requesting 6 months of funding starting July 1, 2024 and ending December 31, 2024.\n\nWe request to extend the existing budget of $29,000 USDC per month for technical development and advisory.\n\n**ETH Address to Receive Funds:** 0x811912c19eEF91b9Dc3cA52fc426590cFB84FC86",

This proposal aims to extend the technical services and advisory component for an additional 6 months (January 1, 2024 - June 30, 2024). As in the previous proposals, marketing services provided by the Beethoven X DAO are submitted as a [separate proposal](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-xx-funding-proposal-for-the-beethoven-x-dao-marketing-sp-jan-jun-24/5406).\n\nOur primary roles include API team lead (franz), frontend contributor (groninge) and ecosystem technical lead (daniel). While the past nine months have been turbulent at times, we strongly believe it has once again demonstrated the resilience of the Balancer DAO and the entire ecosystem. Despite a [key service provider winding down](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/rfc-orb-collective-s-path-forward/4778), several core contributors stepping down, and a [critical vulnerability](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/vulnerability-found-in-some-pools/5102), we are collectively still here, building.\n\nThe upcoming release of Balancer V3 presents an opportunity for Balancer to regain narrative and establish ourselves as the platform to empower current and future AMM innovation. We are hugely optimistic in the future of Balancer Protocol and steadfast in our dedication to support the ecosystem to the best of our abilities. As we work towards Balancer V3, it has been inspiring to participate in the development of a more cohesive technology stack to empower the future of the protocol. A technology stack that leverages the collective experiences and expertise of contributors across the ecosystem, avoiding siloed development strategies that lead to unnecessary system complexity in Balancer V2.\n\nAs we operate as a small part of a much larger system, our successes are enabled by many across the ecosystem. As such, we present a broader ecosystem update below that touches on our specific contributions when relevant. As we continue to find the best way to bring value to the Balancer ecosystem, we welcome community feedback.\n\n**Integrations**\n\nThree Rocks recently [announced](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/integrations-team-three-rocks-november-2023-update/5408) their decision to wind down effective December 2023. Both @rabmarut and @gerg have been long time contributors to the Balancer ecosystem. We’d like to extend a thank you to the entire Three Rocks organization, they are a team of talented engineers who made countless contributions to the protocol as well as serving as the technical interface to external partners, they will be missed. \n\nOver the last few months, there has been ecosystem wide discussions around the future of integrations at Balancer, resulting in with what we see as a very positive outcome to a challenging situation. Effective January 2024, the responsibilities of the integrations team will transition to Balancer Labs under the leadership of John Grant. With John Grant’s extensive knowledge of the entire Balancer ecosystem and the support of existing Three Rocks team member @Mkflow27, integrations will become a part of what is currently the Balancer Labs SDK team. With expertise in both on- and off-chain integrations into Balancer Protocol, we see this team as being well suited to fill the gap left by Three Rocks. While John is on a well deserved parental leave, I have been working directly with mkflow to help facilitate a smooth transition.\n\nWe’d additionally like to extend a huge thanks to Fernando and the entire Balancer Labs team for their willingness to take on the responsibilities and costs for integrations moving forward. This significantly reduces the operational costs incurred by the DAO, and is yet another example of Balancer Labs' ongoing commitment to the long-term success of the Balancer protocol.\n\n**Smart Contracts**\n\nBalancer V3 has been the core focus of the Smart Contracts team for the majority of the last two quarters. While the feature set has not yet been publicly disclosed, we are extremely excited about the technical direction of Balancer V3. Architecturally speaking, there has been a focus on:\n\n- Interface design - with the overarching goal of making it significantly easier to integrate with Balancer protocol.\n- Reducing overall system complexity\n- Improved code readability by reducing inheritance depth and leveraging libraries for composition.\n\nInternally, the smart contracts team is on track to complete its second major milestone at the end of this year, a first MVP of the core contracts of Balancer V3. It has been an absolute pleasure collaborating closely with @juani, @endymionjkb and @ylv. I think I can speak for the entire team when I say that we’re very much looking forward to sharing more details on Balancer V3 publicly.\n\n**SDK**\n\nProgress on the new [b-sdk](https://github.com/balancer/b-sdk) has continued over the past two quarters, and it is fast approaching feature complete for Balancer V2. In contrast to the existing [Balancer SDK](https://github.com/balancer/balancer-sdk), the new b-sdk is highly focused on facilitating on-chain interactions with the Balancer Protocol. Data intensive operations are now delegated to the Balancer API, allowing the SDK to be focused in its goals. The SDK team has additionally been a huge contributor in interface design for Balancer V3, their in-depth understandings of V2 integration pain points have been invaluable in the process.\n\nAn important initiative worth highlighting is the cross-organizational effort to implement a generalized approach for [price impact calculations](https://github.com/balancer/b-sdk/blob/d8dc287253160d20c877a57ac4c4c60190b22770/src/entities/priceImpact/index.ts) in the b-sdk. Spearheaded by @brunoguerios from the SDK team and @ZenDragon from the Maxis, their efforts have produced a first iteration of a generalized approach that will reliably calculate price impact for all pool actions, irrespective of the underlying invariant implementation. This is a massively valuable development for the entire ecosystem.\n\n**Frontend**\n\nThe upcoming release of Balancer V3 presents an opportunity for a new take on the existing frontend application. OpCo and Beethoven X contributors have spent the last several months laying the groundwork on a new version of the Balancer Frontend. With a fresh new look, the new Balancer Product will be:\n\n- Multi-chain native to allow for quick exploration of liquidity pools across all Balancer supported networks.\n- API powered to facilitate fast loading times, overcoming many of the data challenges plaguing the current V2 application.\n- Version agnostic to ensure that any liquidity that stays on V2 will benefit from the streamlined UX.\n- Designed with a flexible architecture, with the goal to easily support all current and future pool types.\n\nLed by @gareth, OpCo and Beethoven X contributors are collectively leveraging their extensive Balancer domain knowledge to build a better product.\n\n**API**\n\nAs the limitations of the subgraph have been a constant bottleneck for V2, the Balancer Labs Data team, lead by @mendesfabio, have made the decision that future versions of the Balancer subgraph will be focused primarily on data extraction (E). This is in recognition that the API is better suited for the role of data transformation (T) and loading (L). As the API will play an important role in the Balancer tech stack, former SDK team member Jarek has transitioned to the API team and we expect that there will be a close collaboration between the API and Data teams as we move towards Balancer V3.\n\nBelow, we present general API updates, written by Beethoven X DAO contributor franz, API team lead:\n\nOver the last months, our main effort went into getting the API ready for the new frontend-v3 and the b-sdk. As the frontend aims to serve a multi-chain user experience, the API must also support these requirements. Working closely together with OpCo, requirements for queries have been defined and implemented one-by-one as they are needed in the development process. \n\nMany other, smaller changes have also been integrated into the API to support data needs for the new frontend such as specific filters, rate provider data, FX pools support or yield fee specifics.\n\nAdditionally, the API is also used in the new b-sdk to “enrich” pool data that is being used for various pool operations. Together with Balancer Labs we defined the requirements for the API and integrated the changes. These requirements mainly comprise specific needs on nested pools, token indexes or other token data.\n\nAdditional points of interest:\n\n- In August, BASE chain was integrated into the API which is responsible for serving pricing data to the UI.\n- Optimizations have been made to the infrastructure deployment that resulted in a more cost effective solution. In addition, more changes are planned that should further reduce the cost of operating the infrastructure.\n- On November 27th, we successfully deprecated the veBal voting-gauges.json file in GitHub in favor of the API. All known partners have migrated and will query the API in the future. With this change we automate a manual operations task, reducing manual work.\n- We have helped the community in Discord with questions regarding development, inner workings of the UI and API, to help them understand the liquidity mining or voting processes from Balancer and with general questions.\n- We’ve supported the Balancer Maxis with their data needs for the gauge rewards automation program. Also, showcasing the rich data set that the API has on Balancer pools and how to make use of it.\n\n**Key Objectives & Success Metrics:**\n\n- **Make it easier to build on Balancer** - Having become domain experts on Balancer tech, Beethoven X collaborators are uniquely positioned to identify and help build solutions for many of the pain points that exist in the current Balancer tech stack.\n- **Reduce duplicate effort across the ecosystem** - A joint API deployment is the first of several projects we see where Beethoven X contributors can leverage their domain expertise to reduce duplicate effort. How do we as an ecosystem invest significantly more energy into the future success of Balancer protocol and spend less time on the problems of today?\n- **Help drive the direction of the Balancer protocol** - We believe Balancer protocol should be a platform that empowers current and future AMM innovation. We will continue to work to align the various parties in the balancer ecosystem around this vision. How do we put a true focus on this goal? How do we empower developers to build the next generation of AMMs on Balancer protocol?\n\n**Length of Engagement & Budget:**\n\nBeethoven X DAO is requesting 6 months of funding starting January 1, 2024 and ending June 30, 2023.\n\nWe request a budget of $29,000 USDC per month for technical development and advisory. The increase of $4,000 USDC per month reflects increased involvement from groninge on the development of the new v3 frontend.\n\n**ETH Address to Receive Funds:** 0x811912c19eEF91b9Dc3cA52fc426590cFB84FC86",

        "body": "**Service Provider Name:** Balancer OpCo (Product Team)\n\n**Core Contributor(s):** Gareth, Alberto, Anastas & Pon\n\n**Adhere to [[BIP-372] ](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-372-adopt-sp-standards/5009)and the SP standards:** YES\n\n**Introduction**\nBalancer OpCo Limited (or the “Balancer OpCo”) is a wholly-owned operating subsidiary of the Balancer Foundation. It is an integral element of the Balancer Foundation corporate structure supporting the Balancer DAO. It serves two primary functions (1) Administrative and Operational; and (2) Product Development.\n\nSince the passing of [BIP-55](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-55-funding-proposal-for-the-balancer-opco/3609) and its subsequent extension ([BIP-351](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip351-funding-proposal-for-the-balancer-opco-product-team-fy23-q3-through-fy24-q1/4927)), Balancer OpCo has been an integral element of the DAO since July 2022. This proposal aims to extend the product development services for an additional 6 months (April 1, 2024 - September 30, 2024). As in the previous proposal, the administrative and operational elements provided by Balancer OpCo are submitted as a separate proposal.\n\nOur primary roles include Frontend Team Lead (Gareth), Frontend Core Engineers (Anastas and Alberto), and Product Designer (Pon). We also contract Ansaf, a long-time community member and experienced frontend developer, on a part-time basis.\n\nThe proposal period has been reduced from 9 months to 6 months to align with other service providers. Balancer OpCo is requesting $373,290 and 15,711.56 BAL for 6 months of funding starting April 1, 2024 and ending September 30, 2024.\n\n**Retrospective**\nBalancer OpCo product team was previously funded ([BIP-351](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip351-funding-proposal-for-the-balancer-opco-product-team-fy23-q3-through-fy24-q1/4927)) for 9 months from July 1, 2023, through to March 31, 2024.\n\nOur high-level goals stated in the previous proposal are as follows:\n\n* Increase LP engagement and satisfaction.\n* Increase veBAL adoption and holder engagement.\n* Increase awareness and adoption of the Balancer protocol.\n\nThese goals have not changed and will continue to guide our focus as we build out v3 of the Balancer canonical app.\n\nBefore shifting focus to v3, our primary focus was to track and improve the general user/LP experience in the v2 app. The KPI we used to do that was the Transaction Flow Error Free Rate, which is fatal errors in transaction flows divided by the total number of successful transactions submitted through the UI. When we started tracking this in July 2023 we were at ~84%. A concentrated effort was made to fix all fixable bugs in those flows and by February 2024 we were able to improve that rate to ~95%. It’s possible with further concentrated effort we could improve that KPI by 1-2%, however, some portion of the remaining 5% are bugs and issues that can be very challenging to resolve, such as wallet errors and specific user network/device issues.\n\nAlthough our focus was generally on improving UX and supporting growth opportunities in the v2 app, very early on in our previous funding period it became clear that we would need to shift focus to a new canonical web application that would support both Balancer v2 and v3 vaults. The reasons behind this are outlined in our [November monthly update](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/opco-product-team-november-2023-update/5417). In November 2023 we publicly put the v2 app into maintenance mode and shifted our focus to the v3 app.\n\nDespite most of our focus being directed towards the v3 application, we have done our best to support growth opportunities in v2 as they arose. An example of this is quickly supporting LRT pools and making them easily findable. We recognise that opportunities for the Balancer ecosystem, like LRTs, are extremely important for the growth of the protocol and we will always do what we can to support marketing and partnership operations through improvements in the UI.\n\nIn September 2023, Tim who was responsible for our backend infrastructure moved on to a new opportunity. Tim had built our v2 API that still serves the v2 frontend application. For v3, we will be using the shared Beets/Balancer API which is managed by Franz at Beets. So we are not looking to hire a replacement and therefore our people costs for this funding cycle are lower.\n\n**Key Objectives and Success Metrics**\nOur key objective for this funding proposal is to launch the v3 web application. The primary motivation for building a v3 app is to build support from the ground up for both v2 and v3 vaults and make the app multi-network native, that is, users will be able to explore and interact with pools across all networks and vaults within the same app. This would have been extremely difficult to do well within the context of the v2 app. This objective also includes a complete rebranding of the Balancer UI/UX.\n\nWe have already made significant progress towards this objective and aim to launch a beta UI by mid-April 2024. Following the beta launch, we will complete support for the v3 vault and launch the UI to the general public alongside the launch of the v3 protocol. The current target for the v3 launch is the end of Q2, 2024.\n\nOur secondary objective is to begin to deprecate the v2 application and its supporting infrastructure. The supporting infrastructure such as the v2 API contributes to our costs and the quicker we can deprecate it the quicker we can lower Balancer OpCo’s 3rd party software costs.\n\nThe success metrics for these objectives are clear, the protocol needs a UI that can support the v2 and v3 vaults, and the UI development should not delay the launch of the v3 protocol. However, our success metrics, besides launching the new app and v3 support, remain essentially the same as with v2. Our focus is on improving the experience and engagement for LPs and veBAL holders. We are already tracking some relevant KPIs (Transaction Flow Error Free Rate & NPS). We will continue to track and report these KPIs as we launch the v3 app.\n\nIn summary, Balancer OpCo’s product team is committed to building a market-leading DApp for the Balancer protocol and supporting growth opportunities through UI development as they arise. The product team are passionate about Balancer and committed to its long-term success.\n\n**Ongoing commitments**\nThe Product Development team ensures Balancer has a high-quality UI/UX available everywhere that allows users to interact easily with the Balancer protocol. In addition, the UI serves as a branding tool where people can better understand what the Balancer Protocol allows. The team will:\n\n* Build, Improve and Optimize the canonical UI for interacting with Balancer\n  * We aim to provide the best possible experience for users to provide liquidity, swap, lock veBAL, vote on gauges, and claim earnings using Balancer.\n  * We will design, build and maintain the marketing pages for the Balancer protocol. The primary aim of these pages will be to inspire and help onboard potential partners into the ecosystem.\n  * We ensure this UI works across all modern devices including desktop and mobile browsers.\n  * We will continually optimize and improve this app so users have a great experience no matter how many features or how much data Balancer introduces in the future.\n  * We will continually work on the stability and reliability of the UI by covering its critical functionality with unit, integration and eventually E2E (End to End) tests.\n  * Whenever new features or improvements are made to the Balancer smart contracts we will implement the primary UI for users to interact with them on launch.\n  * This also includes responsibility for all copywriting across the app.\n* Ecosystem design support\n  * We will support broader ecosystem design initiatives. For example, we’ll collaborate with marketing on creative direction and occasional asset production.\n* Support the development and maintenance of the shared Beets/Balancer API\n  * The Product Development team currently maintains the Balancer API at https://api.balancer.fi, which provides quick access to Balancer pool and token information, as well as a SOR interface that services such as CowSwap use to calculate the best trade routes through Balancer pools.\n  * The existing API mentioned above will be deprecated in favour of the shared Beets/Balancer API at https://api-v3.balancer.fi.\n  * Additional functionality will be added to the shared Beets/Balancer API to support a simpler UI layer for v3.\n* User support\n  * We will monitor relevant channels in Discord, Slack and Github issues for any reported problems and aim to respond within 24 hours and fix the problem as soon as possible.\n* OpCo operations\n  * Manage DNS for all Balancer DAO domains.\n  * Manage user accounts/email addresses under those domains.\n  * Manage 3rd party accounts, upgrades, renegotiations, etc. For example, RPC providers, AWS, and wallet check providers.\n\nGithub repositories that we are directly responsible for:\n\n* https://github.com/balancer/frontend-v3\n* https://github.com/balancer/frontend-v2 (to be deprecated)\n* https://github.com/balancer/balancer-api (v2 API, to be deprecated)\n* https://github.com/balancer/tokenlists\n* https://github.com/balancer/marketing-site (to be deprecated)\n* https://github.com/balancer/metadata\n\nGithub repositories we are not directly responsible for but contribute to:\n\n* https://github.com/balancer/balancer-sdk\n* https://github.com/balancer/b-sdk\n* https://github.com/balancer/docs\n* https://github.com/balancer/backend\n\n**Reporting**\nThe Product Development team is committed to transparency and openness in all our work. The majority of our day-to-day activities can be followed via the previously mentioned repositories. We are also committed to providing higher-level reporting on our work in the relevant calls and on the forum. Our reporting commitments will be as follows:\n\n* Weekly v3 roadmap call\n  * Audience: Internal, engineering and ecosystem leadership.\n  * Here we share status updates on our latest work and take note of any urgent requirements or future work for our team.\n* Monthly forum update\n  * Audience: Public\n  * A high-level written report of work done over the past 30 days, including how that work relates to our stated goals. We will also include reflections on challenges that may be standing in the way of progress on those goals.\n  * Relevant metrics that the Product Development team’s work has a direct impact on.\n* Quarterly community call update (if applicable)\n  * Audience: Public\n  * A higher-level update on the work done over the last quarter and work planned for the next quarter, including KPIs and visual content if relevant. This update will also include reflections on the team and its performance and any changes to the overall direction described in this funding proposal or previous quarterly reports.\n\n**Length of Engagement & Budget**\nBalancer OpCo product team is requesting 6 months of funding starting April 1, 2024 and ending September 30, 2024.\n\nWe request a total budget of $373,290 for the full period. Note that Balancer OpCo holds enough funds to cover the requested funding. This was saved due to the reduction in spend achieved by OpCo and other Service Providers vs their original budgets in years 1 and 2. For that reason, no new funding is required from the DAO for this proposal. The table below shows the applicable expense categories by quarter.\n![bip-565-2.png](ipfs://bafkreibzvgelwxzehhvztwqftrggjbhvbum4k6rhjj6i5abtoryqhpgoom) \n\nNote that Non-People Costs are reduced in Q2 as we transfer some of those costs into the Balancer OpCo Admin & Ops [supplementary proposal](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-xxx-opco-admin-ops-supplementary-budget-for-q2-2024/5628). These costs are for 3rd party services that are used throughout the ecosystem and are critical to the ongoing operation of the DAOs infrastructure. We are referring to these as “Protocol Infrastructure”.\n\nA further breakdown of the Balancer OpCo Product Team costs is shown below:\n![bip-565-1.png](ipfs://bafkreigag7amrn6sougc46ncjc57gyaoioz3o4qgsbyhwsntolcqzsdjei)\n    \n\nIn addition, the Balancer OpCo is requesting an allocation of 15,711.56 BAL for the 6 month period of the proposal that aligns with the grants included in staff employment packages. This BAL would be awarded as compensation to current team members on a 4-year vesting basis, with a 1-year cliff, starting from each employee’s initial employment date in the ecosystem.\n\nShould any of these employees leave before the completion of the 2 quarter proposal period, any unvested BAL would not go to the departing employee and would be available to the OpCo for allocation as incentives to potential replacement staff.\n\n**Link to Service Provider Agreement (if going through the Balancer OpCo)**\nNot applicable given this entity is internal. The Product team will be directly accountable to the Balancer OpCo and the Balancer DAO community through the reporting process applicable to all Balancer SPs, primarily with reference to the objectives and KPIs noted above.",

This proposal requests funding the Balancer Maxis SP for the upcoming 6 months from Q2 to Q3 of 2025.\n\n## Initiatives\n\nWe propose to work on 3 key initiatives that fully align the DAOs goals of becoming an efficient, profitable, innovative and builder friendly DEX. Looking back at our previous funding [proposal](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-694-fund-balancer-maxis-for-q4-2024-to-q1-2025/5991/5), we want to continue with improving on-chain automation and operations as we still see great potential in simplifying processes within the DAO. Additionally, partner management and advising product development go hand-in-hand as we are at the forefront of managing DAO interfacing requests and innovation. Based on these focus points, we propose following initiatives:\n\n### Initiative 1: On-chain Operations and Security Management (DevSecOps)\n\n**Co-Leads**: @Xeonus & @gosuto  \n**Team**: jalbrekt  \n**Summary**  \nWe have made significant improvements of on-chain operations, such as nearly hands-off automation of fee processing for Balancer v2, interruption free automation of BAL reward distribution as well as significantly simplifying the partner onboarding experience. We want to continue to improve and automate as many aspects of our infrastructure and fee processing as possible while also advising on on-chain security. The next natural iteration is the transformation from DevOps to Dev**Sec**Ops with support from Hypernative and Balancer Labs:\n\n* On-chain operations and monitoring  \n* Self-service modules and management (Ops UI)  \n* Automated Fee processing  \n* Treasury multi-sig management oversight and execution in collaboration with @kpk   \n* Leading of a newly formed security council of ecosystem participants\n\n#### Objectives\n\n1. **Manage and Operate Balancer deployments (v2 and v3) across chains**  \n   1.

Own and execute on fee processing for all Balancer v3 deployments Balancer controls  \n   2. Oversee and execute on fee processing on Balancer v2, incl. Maintenance and improvements to our newly deployed protocol fee allocator v2 code-base ([see GitHub repo](https://github.com/BalancerMaxis/protocol_fee_allocator_v2))\n\n### Initiative 2: Growth\n\n**Co-Leads**: @ZenDragon & @Mike_B  \n**Team**: @zekraken  \n**Summary**  \nThe Balancer Maxis core focus has developed to include operational excellence, growth, and partner experience.  As partners are onboarding into the Balancer ecosystem, the Maxis are tasked with streamlining the process and providing an enjoyable customer experience to retain as many users as possible. The end goal of the growth team is to simplify the process of onboarding and leveraging Balancer’s tech. We are dedicated to growing the product offerings Balancer has to meet market needs, communicating this to partners and the greater market, and finally utilizing these dominant products to grow the revenue and value proposition of the protocol.\n\nObjectives:\n\n1. **Growth of Balancer V3** over the next 6 months to attain at a minimum 300M USD in TVL. The current growth trajectory points towards higher expectations, but linearly 300M over 6 months represents the current growth pace. This goal sets a realistic target which the Balancer Service Providers will aim to fulfill. While not in ETH terms, our DAO costs are denominated in USDC primarily so for now TVL goals will be as well.  \n2. **Driving the DAO towards cash flow positive** in terms of revenue taken to the DAO vs. costs of service providers. The DAO team composition is quite lean at this point, so our only option is to drive revenue into Balancer across the board to make this possible. Partnerships will do so via bringing in new business with the BDSP through structured configuration of pools, hooks, and incentive optimizations as needed.  \n   1. The definitive target is ⅓ of Balancer revenue or more to come from Balancer V3 by the end of this 6 month window. Due to large legacy pools such as Aave/wstETH and stickiness on V2, this is a fair target.  \n3. **Owning the market to product development feedback loop** lands on partnerships to relay what products are needed in order to drive further growth. This is demonstrated by the StableSurge hook’s recent success and the ability to understand partner needs becoming a tangible solution which increases business outcomes.  \n   1. Over the next 6 months the goal is to have new unique products launched on Balancer V3 attain over 50M in TVL. Including hooks such as StableSurge, MEV Capture, and any new invariants built in house by the Balancer Labs team.  \n   2. In addition, at least one new product deployed must be credited to this feedback loop process and an article on the initial demand to the deployment and go to market will be presented in the last month of this engagement.   \n4. **Grow ecosystem and governance participation** by onboarding 3 additional DAOs or entities to participate in the veBAL system at some capacity. This is to occur over the next 6 months and will include sparking renewed participation from any existing DAOs such as Gnosis or Aave. The goal is advancing the narrative around Balancer and aligning partners with the ecosystem.  \n5. **Streamlining and Transforming Partner Experience.** In tandem with the above initiatives led by @Xeonus and @gosuto to automate processes regarding reward distribution, payload creation, reviews, and partners interacting with front-end tools the goal is to have as hands off a process from pool creation to gauge proposal as possible. Historically Balancer SP’s have provided a “white glove” onboarding service to partners, which will continue, but in a different capacity. The tools in place will be utilized for partners to handle the entire process of onboarding in the majority of new prospects. During this time the partner management team will continue to assist, and drive feedback to the DevOps team to reach the final form of a 100% partner owned onboarding experience.   \n   1. This applies to pool, gauge, and injector creation with only minor necessity for hook configuration, amplification parameter changers, add_reward, and injector assistance in the cases where only governance or the Maxis have the ability to change an outcome.  \n   2. Furthermore reducing rate provider review lead time to a 2 week maximum in even the busiest of times is an attainable goal by coordinating with partners, the internal priorities of Balancer Labs reviewers, and the expected expansions to new chains + new lending markets for boosted pools.  \n   3. Longer term additional items can be covered such as a more streamlined token whitelisting process, providing images for tokens where they don’t exist on coingecko, and management of metadata related to how pools display in the front end (ex. pool summary, pool naming, points system, etc.)  \n6. **Driving development on Balancer V3.**  Coordinate with external teams to drive development of innovative AMM based products on Balancer V3.  This includes but is not limited to teams like QuantAMM, CoWAMM, Akronswap, EZKL, and others. In order to make Balancer V3 a thriving ecosystem of innovative AMM tech, we must seek out and work to build novel AMM innovation both internally and externally.    \n   1. Identifying promising AMM teams to join the Balancer ecosystem  \n   2. Assist with the development process, coordinate technical meetings, structure go to market strategies, and align on objectives.    \n      1. Over the next 6 months, launch at least 2 externally built AMMs on top of Balancer v3  \n   3. Brainstorm and execute on internally built innovations in the AMM space  \n      1. Readjusting CLAMM  \n      2. MEV capturing technologies  \n      3. Dynamic fee methodologies  \n      4. Oracle based AMMs  \n   4. Work with the integrations team to ensure trades route through innovative new pool types  \n   5. Expand pool offerings to cover a wider range of assets classes such as  \n      1. RWAs  \n      2. Volatile long and short tail pairs  \n      3. New token launches\n\nThe goal of the above initiatives is to expand Balancer V3 market share in the volatile asset market, of which we are currently underrepresented.    \n\t\n\n### Initiative 3: Interfacing with Product Development\n\n**Co-Leads**: @ZenDragon & @Xeonus  \n**Team**: @zekraken  \n**Summary**  \nThe Balancer Maxis have the unique position to have direct interaction with strategic partners while also running protocol operations. Therefore, we want to leverage this position to aid BLabs in developing and improving our product suite. Additionally, we aim to experiment with tooling or pilot projects to showcase the power of Balancer v3. Our intention is to focus on 3-4 strategic objectives and report their outcome in our monthly updates\n\n**Objectives**\n\n1. **Integration and functional testing**  \n   1. Partner with smart contracts team to perform user testing, provide feedback, and provide additional requirements if necessary during build phase  \n   2. Perform data analysis and make adjustment to parameters if necessary for new pool types or other new functionality such as hooks  \n   3. Build additional tooling such as the MEV arb bot which allows immediate trade flow through pools before aggregators and/or other bots can integrate. Also seek to bring additional volume to Balancer. Share and teach tooling to any partners if required.  \n2. **Analytics experience**  \n   1. Interface with the OpCo design and BLabs data teams to build a native Zen UI analytics experience based on Dune and Subgraph data  \n   2. Advise the backend team how to integrate key metrics into api-v3  \n3. **veBAL experience**  \n   1. The veBAL voting page has been the last component that needs to be migrated to the Zen UI. We will consult the front-end team in product development execution which includes: testing, optimizing and interfacing with voting incentive market providers, Testing and executing on new voting strategies incl. A veBAL multi-voter module similar to our DeFilytica prototype that has been in production for a while.  \n   2. Improve UX around veBAL management such as voting, veBAL power and vote delegation  \n4. **Hook ideation and execution**  \n   1. @ZenDragon stable surge hook is already gaining a lot of positive traction for the protocol. We want to further explore hook ideas based on partner feedback and be involved in prototyping potential ideas with BLabs.\n\n**Service Provider Name & Overview**: Balancer Maxis\n\n**Leader(s):** Xeonus, joined by the talented, gosuto, Zen Dragon, Zekraken and jalbrekt\n\n**Contributors/Freelancers**: -\n\n**Pledge to abide by [BIP-702](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-702-balancer-dao-service-providers-and-grantee-standards/5998) Balancer DAO Service Provider & Grantee Standards**: Yes** \n\n**Domains of Operation**:\n\n* Governance and Protocol Operations  \n* Partner Management and Business Development  \n* On-Chain Development, Security and Operations (DevSecOps)  \n* Pool Design and Ecosystem Coordination  \n* Data Analytics and Reporting\n\n**Key Objectives per Operational Discipline**:\n\n1. **Governance and Protocol Operations**\n\n* Leading governance procedures, ensuring their execution and integrity.  \n* Facilitating technical discussions within governance scopes.  \n* Setting up governance votes and reviewing payloads for DAO transactions.  \n* Crafting detailed governance proposals and specifications.  \n* Offering deep technological insights during governance deliberations.  \n* Assisting in specifications to proposals for proper payload execution  \n* Infrastructure and tool creation for enhancing governance operations.  \n* Automating tasks, reducing human dependency in governance functions.  \n* Creating UI tools that support operational tasks (past examples: pool creation, reward injectors, linear pool deployment)\n\n**2.

Consult our monthly updates for progress [here](https://forum.balancer.fi/c/service-provider/balancer-maxis/18). To ensure full transparency on our working objectives, achievements and cost basis, we will update the ecosystem and community participants regularly through weekly meetings and monthly community reports:  \n**Ecosystem Meetings**\n\n* Inform ecosystem participants of our weekly progress and planned activities  \n* Coordinate collaborations and issues with other ecosystem stakeholders\n\n**Monthly reports**\n\n* Write up detailed monthly reports on key objectives  \n* Provide a financial statement of the usage of discretionary funds as in previous funding rounds\n\n**Length of Engagement & Budget:** \n\nThe Maxis have established a conservative and effective budgeting framework with a mix of fixed contributor salaries and flexible discretionary budgeting. Over the last year, Maxis have requested a large discretionary budget of $15k USDC a month. Based on our experience from the last 2 funding rounds, and our new team composition, we concluded that we will not need such high discretionary funds anymore. As a result, we will reduce the monthly ask of this position to $5k a month (from $15k a month).  \nAdditionally, based on our conservative spending framework, we can carry over significant savings of 75,000USDC that will be deducted further reducing our overall funding request.  \nGiven we are also taking over BD for the DAO our total FTEs will slightly increase from 5 to 5.25 while keeping the average cost basis per FTE roughly the same (see [previous funding request](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-694-fund-balancer-maxis-for-q4-2024-to-q1-2025/5991)).\n\nA detailed breakdown of our funding request with cost breakdown is visualized below:  \n![maxis_q2q3_1.png](ipfs://bafkreifppktx3upxmysc6djfioe45yeomjtxexmvx5p7j4k66miew3rj3a)\n\nWe are additionally asking for a BAL token grant of 37,500 BAL for the next half-year (at BAL price of $1.4). BAL will be locked for 1 year with a custom vesting contract.  \nQuarterly BAL allocation: $23,437 ( = 18,750 BAL)\n\nIn total our USDC and BAL cost basis breakdown looks as follows for 5.25 FTE:\n\n| Position | Cost Basis |\n| :---- | :---- |\n| $ / FTE / month (USDC + BAL vest) | $13,571.4 |\n| $ / FTE / month (USDC) | $11,904,7 |\n| Discretionary monthly allocation | $5,000 |\n\n### Optimized cost footprint compared to previous funding proposals (Maxis & BDSP)\n\n| Position | Maxis: Prev. Proposal | BDSP Prev. Proposal | Maxis: Actual proposal | Savings |\n| :---- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |\n| People cost ($) | $334,500.00 | $72,000.00 | $375,000.00 | $31,500.00 |\n| BAL Token Grant ($) | $61,874.82 | $12,000.00 | $52,500.00 | $21,374.82 |\n| Discretionary | $90,000.00 | $0.00 | $30,000.00 | $60,000.00 |\n\nThis results in a total reduction of our bi-annual footprint by $112,874 or $225,749 annually attributed to a reduced head-count (for Maxis and BDSP combined) and reduced ask in discretionary funds.  \nWith the additional savings of $75,000 from the last funding round **we get a total of $300,749 in savings until end of Q3**\n\n### Personnel Changes\n\nWith our new focus on on-chain operations, security, BD and partner management, we will further optimize our team-composition. As a result, @MikeB and @zekraken will aid @ZenDragon in BD efforts.@zekraken will increase his part-time contributor role to nearly full-time (0.75 FTE). Jalbrekt is now fully onboarded as a part-time contributor and signer and will continue to work as a part-time contributor. This new team composition will guarantee the most optimal cost basis and efficiency for the DAO in terms of Ops and BD deliverables.\n\n**Length of engagement**: 6 months  \n**Budget:** 330,000 USDC and 37,500 BAL\n\n**ETH Address to Receive Funds:** `0x166f54F44F271407f24AA1BE415a730035637325` \n\n**Impact on the Treasury**\n\nThe Treasury wallets currently approximately hold 3,392,654 BAL. Funding the Balancer Maxis for the next half year would impact 0.55% of the treasury’s BAL holdings, which annualizes to 1.11% of the treasury’s BAL. The Treasury wallets currently hold 4.804mln in stables (excluding stables in v3 buffers). Funding the USDC portion would cost around 3.43% of the treasury’s stable reserve, which annualizes to 13.7%.\n\n### Technical Specification\n\nThe Balancer DAO multisig `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` will interact with USDC `0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48` by writing transfer passing the Maxi Safe `0x166f54F44F271407f24AA1BE415a730035637325` as recipient and amount `330000` USDC as `330000000000`\n\nFurthermore the Balancer DAO multisig `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` will interact with BAL `0xba100000625a3754423978a60c9317c58a424e3D` by writing transfer passing the Maxi Safe `0x166f54F44F271407f24AA1BE415a730035637325` as recipient and amount `37500` as `37500000000000000000000`\n\nEdits by Maxis:\n* revised Ops and Growth Proposal",
