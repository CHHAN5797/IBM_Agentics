Future pxETH yield and pxETH withdrawals can be tokenized and used within DeFi. Further details about pxETH can be found in the whitepaper [here](https://github.com/redacted-cartel/pirex-eth-whitepaper/blob/master/pxETH_whitepaper.pdf).\n\nIn addition to the DEX liquidity for pxETH incentivized by Redacted DAO, the Dinero protocol has additional mechanisms to improve pxETH liquidity and support the pxETH:ETH peg in both normal and adverse market conditions allowing for greater pxETH DeFi composability.\n\npxETH can be redeemed for ETH from the Dinero protocol either instantaneously for ETH which has yet to be staked or via ETH which is unstaked from validators. In the future a novel incentivized withdrawal pool will facilitate quicker pxETH withdrawals when there is an ETH unstaking queue and/or adverse market conditions.\n\nThe governance token for pxETH is BTRFLY.\n\n**Motivation:**\n\nRedacted has a long and close relationship with Balancer and Aura. Because of this close relationship and Redacted’s vlAURA governance power, we want to have Balancer as the one of our primary venues for crucial pxETH liquidity.\n\nAn LST is only as good as its peg. Therefore for pxETH to be successful, significant liquidity is required. With a gauge, Redacted plans to use its governance power and bribes to direct emissions to the gauge and incentivize crucial pxETH liquidity on Balancer, allowing for higher volumes in the LP and also generating fees for veBAL holders.\n\n**Specifications:**\n\n1. **Governance:**\n\nRedacted’s governance is currently off-chain using [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/redactedcartel.eth). The multisig address is: 0xA52Fd396891E7A74b641a2Cb1A6999Fcf56B077e. Decisions relating to inflation, liquidity, partnership or DAO treasury go through a DAO vote, and then are executed by the multisig. On-chain governance will come at a later stage.\n\n2. **Oracles:** Does the protocol rely on external oracles? If so, provide details about the oracles and their implementation in the protocol.\n\nNo oracles are currently used.\n\n3. **Audits:** Provide links to audit reports and any relevant details about security practices.\n\nLink to all audits can be found [here](https://dineroismoney.com/docs/security).\n\n4. **Centralization vectors:** Is there any component of the protocol that has centralization vectors? E.g. if only 1 dev manages the project, that is a centralized vector. If price oracles need to be updated by a bot, that is a centralized vector. If liquidations are done by the protocol, that is also a centralization vector.\n\n4/7 multisig (0xA52Fd396891E7A74b641a2Cb1A6999Fcf56B077e) controls the pushing of validators public keys to the contract.\n\n5. **Market History:** Has the asset observed severe volatility? In the case of stablecoins, has it depegged? In the case of an unpegged asset, have there been extreme price change events in the past? Provide specific information about the Balancer pool: how long has it been active, TVL, historical volume? **You must provide a direct link to the pool AND a link to your pool's gauge.**\n\nThe pxETH/ETH pool has not yet been seeded. As explained above, pxETH has redemption mechanisms which allow the peg to be maintained/ arbitraged. Since launch on 2023/12/13, the main liquidity for pxETH is on Maverick (in anticipation of a gauge on Balancer).\n\n6. **Value:** Is this pool intended to be the primary source of liquidity for the token(s)? If this is not the case, explain the expected value add to Balancer (can this pool generate consistent fees?)\n\nWith a gauge, Redacted plans to use its governance power and bribes to direct emissions to the gauge and incentivize crucial pxETH liquidity on Balancer, allowing for higher volumes in the LP and also generating fees for veBAL holders.\n\n**Specification:**\n\nThe Balancer Maxi LM Multisig eth:`0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd` and call the addGauge function with the following arguments:\ngauge(address): `0xdee29b7b6dF3576280bFBbC088ee9eBAA767C0Bd`\ngaugeType(string): `Ethereum`",

        "body": "[PR with Payload](https://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/128)\n\n**Summary:**\n\nProposal to add gauge support for the newly created unshETH 50/50 USH/ETH pool on Ethereum mainnet.\n\nunshETH’s governance token, USH, has launched on both BNB and Ethereum mainnet. The initial liquidity mining program will end on April 5th. The unshETH team plans to conduct the next liquidity mining program on Balancer, and to expand the collaboration between unshETH and Balancer even further in the future. Moreover, unshETH is integrated with an ecosystem partner, Stargate, that will enable scaling of its liquidity.\n\n\n**References/Useful links:**\n\nWebsite - [https://unshETH.xyz/](https://unsheth.xyz/)\n\nDocumentation - [https://docs.unshETH.xyz/](https://docs.unsheth.xyz/)\n\nGithub Page - [https://github.com/unshETH](https://github.com/UnshETH)\n\nCommunities - https://discord.com/invite/5tZXASh5P3\n\n**Other useful links?**\n\nTwitter - [https://twitter.com/unshETH_xyz](https://twitter.com/unsheth_xyz)\n\nBlog - https://mirror.xyz/0x749Dc728A68265e74754Ad8e6cc2649BD42a8f8a\n\n\n**Protocol Description:**\n\nunshETH is a decentralized, on-chain movement for improving validator decentralization. The Matrix prevents monopolies from growing so large that they stifle innovation and endanger the cryptocurrency economy by morphing into a central point of failure via the creation and enforcement of anti-competitive policies and practices.\n\nWithin Ethereum’s DeFi ecosystem, user activities are governed not by laws, but by protocol design and incentives. unshETH's mission is simple — decentralization through incentivization. Through incentive engineering, unshETH aims to distribute capital across the LSD ecosystem in a manner that prioritizes validator decentralization, and therefore the increased safety of the network.\n\nunshETH aims to be a catalyst for LSDfi. LSDfi refers to a new class of DeFi primitives that are built on top of liquid staking derivatives (LSDs) in order to enable markets on staking yields, validator monopolies, slashing risks, and even validator censorship.\n\nLSDfi enables use cases such as validator decentralization mining, validator dominance options, interest rate swaps, yield speculation, and efficient risk pricing. These mechanisms allow users to take advantage of the unique properties of liquid staking derivatives, and can similarly be used to improve healthy competition among validators and restrict capture of the consensus layer.\n\n\n**Motivation:**\n\nunshETH aims to be one of the first protocols to usher in LSDfi. Adding this gauge will allow for USH to have deep, robust liquidity on Balancer markets on any chain. This proposal represents the first step in strengthening the relationship between the two protocols. In addition, this pool is intended to be a primary source of liquidity on Ethereum mainnet - with future considerations for other EVM and Layer 0 compatible chains.\n\nTo achieve this, unshETH intends to begin its second liquidity mining incentives campaign (~1M USH) to veBAL/vlAURA markets. Once this amount has been emitted unshETH will consider future incentives after evaluating the performance of the gauge and depending on future protocol developments.\n\n\n**Details:**\n\nGovernance: unshETH’s governance structures for USH token holders will be launched by the end of April 2023\n\nOracles: No on-chain price feed oracles exist for the USH token at this time.\n\nOmnichain: The USH token is an omnifungible (OFT-20) token.\n\nAudits: Certik Audits of unshETH V1 and V2: [https://skynet.certik.com/projects/unsheth\n](https://skynet.certik.com/projects/unsheth)\n\n\n**Centralization vectors:**\n\nThe unshETH protocol is in the process of rapidly and iteratively decentralizing the protocol, in keeping with the project’s dedication to the ideology and practice of maximally decentralized finance.\n\nWith the launch of unshETH protocol V2, on April 1st, 2023, ownership by the team multisig was fully renounced and any changes affecting user-deposited funds are governed by a 72-hour timelock. Prior to this protocol upgrade there was a centralization risk of the team-controlled multi-sig being able to change oracles and approved minters.\n\nThe deployment of unshETH protocol V2 also launches configurable target weights and risk caps on the user-deposited LSD tokens underlying the unsETH token; currently target weights are set at a fair equal split across Liquid Staking ETH tokens issued by protocols chosen by the team based for their market-leadership. The unshETH team’s ability to set those target weights is a centralization risk that will be mitigated with the launch of the DAO governance structures, which the team is targeting to launch by the end of April 2023.\n\nThe launch of DAO governance and the transition to a ve-style token staking model (called vdUSH) that will empower the USH token holding community to govern protocol parameters such as the target weights.\n\n\n**Market History:** \n\nThe USH token was launched on 1/31/2023. Protocol development was not funded with any outside capital, including that of VC’s or angels. The launch was accomplished via an airdrop, announced on the unshETH blog (https://mirror.xyz/0x749Dc728A68265e74754Ad8e6cc2649BD42a8f8a/1idxwRQ3kdkXGEpmwO_IKiFTC2JgPYdWr6RdlRleTGo) to:\n\n* Early adopters of the old guard of liquid staking\n* Liquid staking pioneers who've been using LSDfi for leverage\n* The savviest yield-seekers this side of L1 (LSD-ETH LP farmers)\n* Team and early contributors\n\nThe airdrop was followed by an initial staking and liquidity mining campaign.\n\n\n**Value:** \nThis pool is intended to be a primary source of liquidity for USH on Ethereum. This gauge is the first step in building a deep collaboration with the Balancer ecosystem and community that will create value for all stakeholders. Balancer and the ecosystem of partners that Balancer has created will be a key part of the growth of unsETH protocol into the market-leader in the nascent LSDfi category.\n\n$USH trading metrics as of 04/03/2023 (Sushiswap: https://app.sushi.com/analytics/pools/0xaaf448d30f01b429fb6e7f9af6a8ff66e694f312?chainId=1):\n\n* Volume (24h) - $2,529,182\n* Fees (24h) - $7,588\n* Utilization (24h) - 106%\n\n\n**Specifications:**\n**Gauge Weight Cap**\nunshETH proposes to cap the gauge emissions to 10%. The current intention of this pool is to allow collected fees to be paid back into the gauge via Core Pool Bribes.\n\nunshETH may return to governance at a later date to request an increase as the need arises and the pool has more history to be used to evaluate it against BIP-57.\n\n\n**Gauge Type**\nNote that this gauge is a traditional gauge, not a single recipient gauge used as part of the ve80/20 program. As a result BAL incentives will be paid out to addresses depositing tokens in the Balancer Gauge. Not to a single smart contract that redirects these tokens to lockers.\n\n\n**Core Pools Designation:**\nWhile this pool contains no boosted tokens, a 0.5% fee has been set on the pool with an intention to participate in the BIP-19 boosted pool program. As with RBN/USDC gauge, It is therefore requested that 100% of the fees earned by this pool and not paid to the DAO are used to pay bribes on the pool. It is further requested that these fees are used bribe the USH/ETH pool directly, instead of participating in the distribution of bribes by TVL as following the protocol for mainnet instead of for side-chains specified in BIP-19. Handling of this pool should change in line with changes to BIP-19.\n\n\n**Details of Gauge to be whitelisted**\nGauge address: [0xCd8bB8cEBc794842967849255C234e7b7619A518](https://etherscan.io/address/0xCd8bB8cEBc794842967849255C234e7b7619A518#code)\nPool address: [0xeabaf850fd494c5661ba15ea5307c11d5307d0e2](https://pools.balancer.exchange/#/pool/0xeabaf850fd494c5661ba15ea5307c11d5307d0e2/about)\n\nThe specific actions of authorizing the DAO multisig, adding the gauge, and removing the authorization using the gauge address above are included in the linked payload.\n\nAuthor\nHarpe is an independent contributor to the unshETH protocol, pursuing growth of the unshETH protocol through collaboration with other DeFi teams and DAOs.

        "body": "### [PR with Payload](https://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/208)\n\n**Summary:**\n> We are deploying two pools on Balancer. One comprises $R and $wstETH while the other pool consists of $R and $DAI. Users will be able to borrow $R stablecoin on the Raft protocol and use the R/wstETH pool to swap $R to $wstETH to leverage up. Users will also be able to borrow $R stablecoin on Raft and use the $R/$DAI pool to swap $R to $DAI. This $DAI can then be used across different money markets, swaps, liquidity pools and vaults, NFT marketplaces, and can even be off-ramped and transferred to all CEXs that support $DAI. The deployment of the R/wstETH and the R/DAI pools is therefore important for all users of Raft.\n>\n> Additionally, Raft will enable users to leverage up on their $stETH positions (utilizing the R/wstETH pool, or via the R/DAI pool) through the one-step leverage feature that uses our [flash mint module](https://docs.raft.fi/how-it-works/flash-mint).\n\n\n**References/Useful links:**\n\n>* Website: https://raft.fi/\n>* Documentation: https://docs.raft.fi/\n>* Twitter: https://twitter.com/raft_fi\n>* Discord: https://discord.com/invite/raft-fi\n>* GitHub: https://github.com/raft-fi/\n\n**Protocol Description:**\n\n> Raft is an immutable, decentralized lending protocol that allows users to take out stablecoin loans of $R against $stETH collateral for zero fees. $R is Raft’s native stablecoin. Users can continue to earn their $stETH staking rewards while borrowing $R, making Raft both cost-effective and capital-efficient. As more use cases for $R develop, users will be able to spend, swap, farm, provide liquidity, and off-ramp from DeFi to real-world applications. Users will also be able to leverage up to 11x on $stETH in a single atomic transaction.\n\n**Motivation:**\n\n> The R/wstETH pool on Balancer will allow all users of Raft to swap their borrowed $R into $wstETH to directly leverage up on their stETH and earn more staking rewards. We will be launching a [one-step leverage feature](https://raft.fi/one-step-leverage/) on Raft, but in the meantime, users can either use the [flash-mint module](https://docs.raft.fi/how-it-works/flash-mint) that can interact with the R/wstETH pool or perform this manually.\n>\n>The R/DAI pool on Balancer will allow all users of Raft to swap their borrowed $R into $DAI (or any other asset via multi-step swaps). Users holding $DAI can then use all money markets, DEXs, liquidity pools and vaults, NFT marketplaces, and all other products, on every chain where $DAI can be bridged. This $DAI can also be off-ramped and transferred to CEXs where $DAI is listed. This will allow all users to comfortably borrow $R for their $stETH and be able to use it across the entire ecosystem by swapping it into $DAI.\n\n**Specifications:**\n >\n>1. **Governance:** The Raft protocol is governance minimized. This means that nobody has control over any key part or mechanism that affects how the protocol works. There is no way to pause the smart contracts. Raft only has the ability to adjust fees    \n>\n>2. **Oracles:** The pool relies on price feeds from Chainlink and Tellor\n>\n>3. **Audits:** Raft is audited by Trail of Bits and Hats Finance\n>\n>4. **Market History:** See $R [here](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/r), $wstETH [here](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/wrapped-steth), and $DAI [here](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/dai)\n >\n>5. **Value:** These are the first R/wstETH and R/DAI pools deployed on mainnet resulting in high TVL on Balancer. We expect it to generate a significant amount of volume which will be beneficial for all LPs and users of Raft\n\n**Audits:**\n\n> Raft's smart contracts have been audited twice:\n>\n>1.

Future pxETH yield and pxETH withdrawals can be tokenized and used within DeFi. Further details about pxETH can be found in the whitepaper [here](https://github.com/dinero-protocol/pirex-eth-whitepaper/blob/master/pxETH_whitepaper.pdf).\n>\n>In addition to the DEX liquidity for pxETH incentivized by Dinero Protocol, there are additional mechanisms to improve pxETH liquidity and support the pxETH:ETH peg in both normal and adverse market conditions allowing for greater pxETH DeFi composability.\n>\n>pxETH can be redeemed for ETH from the Dinero Protocol either instantaneously for ETH which has yet to be staked or via ETH which is unstaked from validators. In the future a novel incentivized withdrawal pool will facilitate quicker pxETH withdrawals when there is an ETH unstaking queue and/or adverse market conditions.\n>\n>The governance token for pxETH is DINERO.\n\n**Motivation:**\n\n> Dinero has a long and close relationship with Balancer and Aura. Because of this close relationship and Dinero’s vlAURA governance power, we want to have Balancer as the primary venue for crucial pxETH liquidity.\n>\n>An LST is only as good as its peg. Therefore for pxETH to be successful, significant liquidity is required. With a gauge, Dinero plans to use its governance power and bribes to direct emissions to the gauge and incentivize crucial pxETH liquidity on Balancer, allowing for higher volumes in the LP and also generating fees for veBAL holders.\n\n**Specifications:**\n\n1. **Governance:**\n\nDinero’s governance is currently off-chain using [Snapshot](https://gov.dinero.xyz/). The multisig address is: 0xA52Fd396891E7A74b641a2Cb1A6999Fcf56B077e. Decisions relating to inflation, liquidity, partnership or DAO treasury go through a DAO vote, and then are executed by the multisig. On-chain governance will come at a later stage.\n\n2. **Oracles:** Does the protocol rely on external oracles? If so, provide details about the oracles and their implementation in the protocol.\n\nNo oracles are currently used.\n\n3. **Audits:** Provide links to audit reports and any relevant details about security practices.\n\nLink to all audits can be found [here](https://github.com/dinero-protocol/audits/tree/master).\n\n4. **Centralization vectors:** Is there any component of the protocol that has centralization vectors? E.g. if only 1 dev manages the project, that is a centralized vector. If price oracles need to be updated by a bot, that is a centralized vector. If liquidations are done by the protocol, that is also a centralization vector.\n\n4/7 multisig (0xA52Fd396891E7A74b641a2Cb1A6999Fcf56B077e) controls the pushing of validators public keys to the contract.\n\n5. **Market History:** Has the asset observed severe volatility? In the case of stablecoins, has it depegged? In the case of an unpegged asset, have there been extreme price change events in the past? Provide specific information about the Balancer pool: how long has it been active, TVL, historical volume? **You must provide a direct link to the pool AND a link to your pool's gauge.**\n\nThe pxETH/gtWETHe has just been seeded.

        "author": "0x7019Be4E4eB74cA5F61224FeAf687d2b43998516",
        "body": "In order to initiate operations as per [BIP-103](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-103-karpatkey-balancer-treasury-cu-proposal-update/3895), Karpatkey respectfully requests the Balancer DAO to take the following actions:\n\n1. Dismantle specific positions on the current multisigs on Mainnet, Polygon, and Arbitrum (as outlined in the Execution Details section);\n2. Bridge specific in-scope assets from Polygon and Arbitrum back to Mainnet (as outlined in the Execution Details section);\n3. Transfer all in-scope assets (totaling approximately $5,900,000 as of the day of this writing) to a new SAFE provided by Karpatkey and owned by the Balancer DAO (as outlined in the Next Steps and Execution Details sections).\n\n## Motivation\n\nAfter internal discussion, the Karpatkey team has determined that the Balancer DAO would be best served by a simpler and more direct approach. Since Karpatkey has already been voted in as the treasury manager, there is no longer a need for further discussion or a new vote on the specific allocation of funds, despite having recently proposed the \"Base vs Expanded allocation\" approach.\n\nTo streamline deployment, Karpatkey proposes beginning with the base allocation and then expanding as needed. This approach takes advantage of the Zodiac Roles Modifier permissions preset that has already been created and tested for allowlisting specific functions and protocols related to the base allocation. Karpatkey intends to move forward with this approach and will propose future adjustments in accordance with the guidelines set forth in the original proposal. However, any future adjustments to the strategy, and thus the preset, will ultimately require the approval of the Balancer DAO through the execution of a batch of transactions to apply the adjusted preset.\n\n### Zodiac Roles Modifier preset to be applied\n\nThe original post proposed the following:\n\n[quote=\"karpatkey, post:1, topic:4220\"]\n## Base allocation\n\nIf this proposal was selected, specific functions within the protocols below would be whitelisted. More technical details regarding the whitelisting process will be provided shortly.\n\n* Staking:\n  * Lido\n  * Stakewise\n* Lending:\n  * Compound v2\n  * Aave v2\n* AMM:\n  * Uniswap v3\n[/quote]\n\nTo increase flexibility and adapt to changing market conditions, Karpatkey suggests expanding protocols and functions to include ETH wrappers and unwrappers, swaps on Balancer and Uniswap v3. These swaps, except for regularly swapped reward tokens, are intended to provide Karpatkey with the ability to take immediate action in specific market conditions, such as a stablecoin losing its peg. The pools were chosen based on liquidity to maximize results for the Balancer DAO, but new permissions may be necessary as market conditions change.\n\nThe Manager preset consists of the complete list of permissions that Karpatkey asks the Balancer DAO to grant. This list can be found in this [Annex Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_gtLsmCexiY0XWFwWdgpEaq2wgNDW7Z0ZvsX7p5-C2E/edit?usp=sharing). Through the Zodiac Role Modifier, the Manager preset will be applied to the Manager Role, which in turn will be assigned to Karpatkey’s Manager SAFE.\n\n### Future permissions and roles\n\nOnce the initial strategy is deployed, there will be a periodic need to adapt the portfolio to changing market conditions. If a particular strategy no longer provides sufficient yield, or if a particular pool in which the Balancer DAO has a position becomes deprecated and needs to be migrated, new permissions will be required.\n\nIn addition, creating new roles to improve or expand operations will also be necessary. Two new roles are planned for the near future: the *Harvester Role* and the *Swapper Role*. Both roles will be granted specific subsets of the Manager preset permissions and will be assigned to EOAs to automate certain tasks. The Harvester Role will be allowed to claim rewards, while the Swapper Role will be allowed to swap these rewards for ETH or stablecoins.\n\nWhen deemed appropriate, Karpatkey will create a new forum post requesting the Balancer DAO to update the preset or deploy new roles. The post will include an explanation of why the permissions and/or roles are needed and the executable payload. The proposal will need to be passed by the community and, once approved, it will be executed by the multisig according to the DAO standard operating practices. It is important that this process is as simple and straightforward as possible, since every day of waiting may represent an opportunity cost to the DAO's treasury. A summary of the new permissions and/or roles will be included as a separate section in every corresponding weekly report.\n\n### Next steps\n\nThe next steps for implementing this proposal are as follows:\n\n1. Karpatkey will create a new SAFE, deploy the Roles Modifier contract, and apply the Manager Role preset (as outlined in the Annex Document) to simplify the process for the Balancer DAO.\n2. Karpatkey will conduct a small-scale replication of the strategy for a second round of testing.\n3. Once the SAFE is created, tested, and permissions are applied, Karpatkey will transfer ownership of it to the Balancer DAO and remove themselves as owner.\n4. This proposal will be submitted to Snapshot for approval.\n5. If the proposal is approved, the Balancer DAO will execute the steps described in the Execution Details section.\n\n### Execution details\n\nThe following list is intended to serve as a clear execution roadmap for the Balancer DAO once (if) this proposal is approved:\n\n1. Dismantle the Balancer Boosted AAVE USD position on Mainnet and withdraw 100% of the funds in DAI.\n2. Dismantle WBTC + ETH position on Mainnet and withdraw the two assets in equal proportion.\n3. Dismantle ETH + GTC position on Mainnet and withdraw the two assets in equal proportion.\n4. Dismantle MATIC + USDC + WETH + BAL position on Polygon and withdraw the four assets in equal proportion.\n5. Bridge USDC and WETH from Polygon back to Mainnet.\n6. Dismantle WBTC + WETH + USDC position on Arbitrum and withdraw the three assets in equal proportion.\n7. Bridge WBTC, WETH + USDC from Arbitrum back to Mainnet.\n8. Transfer in-scope assets to the new SAFE. The approximate balances (as of the day of this writing) of in-scope assets that will be transferred are:\n\n|Token|Price|Approx Balance|Total Value|Share %|\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|USDC|$1.00|2,514,827|$2,514,827|42.61%|\n|AAVE|$79.50|16,907|$1,344,129|22.77%|\n|stETH|$1,542.51|312.86|$482,590|8.18%|\n|WETH|$1,552.80|266.81|$414,301|7.02%|\n|wstETH|$1,707.08|155.02|$264,632|4.48%|\n|DAI|$1.00|239,996|$239,996|4.07%|\n|WBTC|$21,007.20|11.06|$232,289|3.94%|\n|USDT|$1.00|218,949|$218,949|3.71%|\n|ETH|$1,553.00|122.82|$190,733|3.23%|\n|Grand Total|||$5,902,446|100.00%|\n\n### Specification\n\nKarpatkey has prepared the Gnosis safe on Ethereum at `0x0EFcCBb9E2C09Ea29551879bd9Da32362b32fc89`.
