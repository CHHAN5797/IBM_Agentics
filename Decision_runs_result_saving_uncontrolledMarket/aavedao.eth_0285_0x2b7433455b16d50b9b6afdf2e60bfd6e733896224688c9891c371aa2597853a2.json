OpenBlock is an established provider of economic modeling for leading protocols in the space, including: EigenLayer, Lido, Arbitrum, Solana, Sui, Uniswap, Scroll, Fuel, Linea, Mode, and many others; we have also received a small grant in the past to study incentives on Aave. OpenBlock Labs is based in San Francisco, CA, dedicated to fostering sustainable growth within decentralized protocols through a data-driven platform.\n\n### **Motivation**\n\nOpenBlock is backed by notable figures in the crypto space, including: Foundation Capital, Electric Capital, Circle Ventures, AlleyCorp, and others. Our team of 40+ has backgrounds from Stanford, a16z, Carnegie Mellon, Meta, Palantir, and other top-tier institutions; the highly technical background of our team makes us confident that OpenBlock is uniquely positioned to tackle a problem of this nature.\n\nOpenBlock brings a distinctive advantage to Aave by harnessing its deep expertise in LSTs, which dominate the supplies of Aave. Our extensive liquidity modeling has delved into the intricate dynamics between LSTs and lending activities. Additionally, OpenBlock is at the forefront of LRT analysis, which will be a critical asset class for Aave to maintain its dominance in the market. We believe our unparalleled expertise in this domain will allow Aave to be a first mover with LRT integrations, while upholding rigorous risk assessment standards\n\n### Specification\n\nOpenBlock will conduct a continuous analysis of new asset listings and propose adjustments based on a number of factors including, but not limited to:\n\n* **Market Risk:** We will leverage time-series analysis to assess liquidity trends, employing econometric models like GARCH to account for volatility clustering in liquidity and volume. This will enable us to forecast liquidity scenarios and ascertain liquidity risks associated with each token.\n* **Agent-Based and Monte Carlo Simulation:** Simulating short-term dynamics like liquidation cascades, such as those driven by liquidator bots with established arbitrage strategies, will be central to our modeling. We also plan to observe the behavior of various network participants, and how they have previously reacted to market events. These interactions will provide insights into how the Aave platform might evolve over time and how various factors could impact its security and asset distribution. Monte Carlo simulations can help predict different scenarios, considering factors such as protocol upgrades, changes in market conditions, and variations in user behavior. These models will provide us with a probabilistic understanding of outcomes and value-at-risk.\n* **Counterparty Risk:** Counterparty risk pertains to the governance of a given asset and degree of centralization. It is assessed based on factors such as: the level of decentralization of the assetâ€™s governance (measured by power law distribution and Gini coefficient calculations), historical security measures taken by the protocol (smart contract audits, economic simulations), smart contract functionality and complexity (enabling withdrawals, supply caps, whitelists), historical risk mitigation in black swan events (kill-switches, speed of governance, depegging scenarios), the number of holders of the asset, and the general market sentiment of the project.\n\nWe outline some of our past work on these topics below.\n\n##### Past Experience: EigenLayer\n\nOpenBlock has diligently conducted comprehensive data collection and monitoring of staking dynamics in our engagement with EigenLayer. Furthermore, we've executed Monte Carlo simulations to forecast staking behavior among validators and LSTs. Our platform offers unparalleled insights into liquid restaking tokens (LRTs) and their liquidity levels across various DeFi integrations. Our ability to remain current on emerging asset classes will prove invaluable for meeting Aave's risk management requirements.\n\n![|624x325](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/Jm9CY_LNvRtNN7D385Icu0WnS_KiO7igMQ9g1GmvsXh2-4WK118g9eNgPA1ZAG3N5-VwUslyK7jIrll_ASreFKWrAzqslEUNs6sA3-zBIhJ5YIjxLAIGhjKzjY6QIyX5AVFJjWi8R-hYMAqzLqLwiG4)\n\n##### Past Experience: Lido\n\nWhen engaging with Lido, OpenBlock utilized advanced data intelligence and modeling to research the dynamics of on-chain liquidity providers and traders of Lidoâ€™s stETH. In completing this analysis, we studied the liquidity needs of potential liquidations on Aave, and built models to recommend incentives to attract sufficient DEX liquidity for these markets. OpenBlock's volume profiling models discovered much of the volume was driven by bots engaging in risk-free arbitrage using stale prices from LPs. This finding was crucial in preventing Lido from continuing to incentivize LPs under the false assumption that the volume was organically increasing.\n\n![|624x329](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/_CMPQFmBuWJx0PCjnVMr121TkI0vIxV3rODsULikJ92ExU2vv6sQoUkrTeCvRYoWDP1VLYs5KkjQSs2M9eaHKmIgxESEyvxTFqnKIPlX1tVXbwbwLeonfylAU8vubwAyLHtpquOH1UeKGW_KF22Igw8)\n\n![|624x329](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/ePyHDkG-Sm9DC_RPm6dDxM2TuD9r-CqtpoXygTgki0-LiNr_ESqpodbIwhmpjOz8T1eL6DVWgsVzWzDeMa7kPisvzh3c0r5llLvIYlTcRSCEEZ-rEndiYksyCWUQ6E4HfsgWBsCamo1VznoE3BMdCOE)\n\n##### Past Experience: Arbitrum\n\nOpenBlockâ€™s engagement with the Arbitrum DAO has spanned three initiatives: STIP, Backfund, and LTIPP. The consistent renewals showcase OpenBlockâ€™s dedicated nature to an ecosystem, and the level of excellence we strive to achieve. This initiative also highlights OpenBlockâ€™s resilience in engaging with a diverse and vocal community, committing to [bi-weekly updates](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/openblock-labs-stip-data-reporting-update-12-15/20119/2) with diligent insights. Our team actively participates in working group calls and offers invaluable guidance as trusted advisors in DAO deliberations. Lastly, we understand the paramount importance of high-integrity data when making pivotal decisions within DAOs, whether it is risk assessment or incentive optimization; our performance for Arbitrum is a testament to the high caliber we consistently uphold in our operations. The public, open-source dashboards are available [here](https://www.openblocklabs.com/app/arbitrum).\n\n![|624x324](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/_C1uFrRJuCVi4G_QoZEo1dp2s6Vx_E2HxEFLcfpL6zPGIk_iQVI5Hiic7MrRgT0vKo_i9DHqi6FjSejg6SJRYEvfzRq4QL4_fMBJ2x6PIbp1GjSmDcS0ydDmf7eqmkaan7MmjbKW-jg88jmk2sXtH3Q)\n\n### Duration & Proposed Budget\n\nImplementation Fee ($40k per month):\n\n* Full-time Data Scientist: $15k per month\n* Full-time Quantitative Researcher: $15k per month\n* Part-time Project Manager: $10k per month\n\nOpenBlock Platform Fee ($30k per month)\n\n* Includes access to exclusive OBL methodologies, models, and datasets (liquidity models, opportunity cost of capital, elasticity, competitive intelligence, incentive optimization, etc.).

        "body": "---\n\n### Title: [TEMP CHECK]  Onboard LlamaRisk as Aave Risk Service Provider \n\n### Author:  LlamaRisk\n\n### Date: 2024-03-20\n\n---\n\n### Summary\n\nLlamaRisk proposes to support Aave as a risk management service provider, reinforcing the DAO's reputation for prioritizing protocol resiliency and user assurances. With a proven track record of thorough risk analysis, an unbiased approach, and an unwavering commitment to the success of our partner protocols, we have earned the trust and endorsement of those we work with.\n\nLlamaRisk was established in 2021 as a service to Curve DAO and its LPs, providing risk transparency analyses of assets listed on Curve, including stablecoins, RWAs (Real World Assets), LSTs (Liquid Staking Tokens), and LRTs (Liquid Restaking Tokens). In 2023, we partnered with Prisma Finance to develop a comprehensive framework for assessing LST collateral risk, which we have used to produce detailed analyses for onboarding assets onto the protocol. We have since expanded our suite of risk management solutions with agent-based simulations and DeFi strategy management.\n\n### Motivation\n\nLlamaRisk is a DeFi-native risk firm that understands the delicate balance protocols face to remain competitive in a rapidly evolving landscape without sacrificing responsible, sustainable practices. \n\nOur core values are transparency and accountability. When armed with reliable and objective information, DAOs and their users are equipped to take action in their best interest. Therefore, our duty is to consistently demonstrate sound reasoning based on thorough analysis that our partners have come to depend on.\n\nLlamaRisk has distinguished itself through:\n\n- **Long-form Comprehensive Risk Analysis:** Over the last two years, we have published over 70 long-form risk assessments in the public domain. Our procedures and QA/QC processes ensure we present clear, unbiased information.\n- **Governance & Parameterization Recommendation:** We have a longstanding history of providing consultation for our risk analyses. Our detailed reports, along with a hands-on approach, have informed critical decisions within our partner DAOs.\n- **Diversity of DeFi Knowledge:** Our team understands many protocol architectures, especially concerning stablecoins, liquid staking derivatives, and pegged assets generally. This knowledge comes from extensive research, development, and hands-on experience with various DeFi protocols, enabling us to anticipate and mitigate risks effectively.\n- C**ommitment to Innovation:** At LlamaRisk, we continually evolve our methodologies and tools to stay at the forefront of DeFi research and risk management, ensuring our strategies are effective.\n\n### Specification\n\nRecognizing the significance of a dual risk provider model, LlamaRisk's proposal is designed to complement Chaos Labs' risk services, with whom we plan to collaborate extensively. \n\nThe initial 6-month engagement, which may be extended pending DAO approval, involves the following scope:\n\n- **On-demand Risk Assessments:** LlamaRisk will deliver prompt and in-depth risk assessments for assets listed or considered to be listed on Aave with particular emphasis on the collateral types comprising the GHO stablecoin. This will involve developing a custom framework tailored specifically to the categories of relevant assets and Aave's needs, which will standardize the assessment process.\n- **Collaborative Engagement with Chaos Labs:** We plan to collaborate extensively with Chaos Labs, combining our expertise to provide Aave with comprehensive and nuanced risk analysis, enhancing the protocol's risk management capacity.\n- **Active Involvement in DAO Governance:** LlamaRisk will actively participate in Aave's DAO governance, offering informed insights and strategic recommendations on risk management practices for principal stakeholders and the community.\n- **Legal Regulatory Advisory and Policy Work:** We will offer specialized legal research and regulatory guidance, including a thorough analysis of evolving legal frameworks and regulatory policies, and equip Aave with the necessary foresight to navigate the regulatory landscape of the DeFi sector effectively.\n\nRisk vectors are diverse and cannot be fully managed by qualitative risk tools. That is why we specialize in comprehensive risk assessment of tokenized assets and DeFi protocols. Our work supports our partners in making informed decisions that mitigate potential threats and promote a culture of transparency and sustainability. Our team of experts meticulously evaluate various risk factors, including but not limited to:\n\n- Protocol design and architecture\n- Tokenomics and economic incentives\n- Smart contract security\n- Governance mechanisms\n- Regulatory compliance\n\nLlamaRisk leverages advanced simulation techniques, including statistical and agent-based modeling, to test and validate DeFi protocols and their collateral assets under various stress scenarios. Our simulations provide valuable insights into potential risks, allowing our partner protocols to set competitive parameters resilient to adverse market conditions.\n\nOur DeFi strategy managers employ data analytics and risk monitoring tools that allow us to maintain high efficiency and safety standards. We support our partners with publications and dashboards that give users the information they need to interact with the protocol responsibly.\n\nOur advisory services cater to the unique needs of DeFi projects, providing strategic guidance and support throughout their lifecycle. From ideation to implementation, our experienced advisors offer expert advice on protocol design, tokenomics, governance, and risk management strategies, ensuring optimal outcomes for our partners.\nComment\n\nTraversing the complex regulatory landscape is crucial for DeFi protocols and projects. Our team of legal experts provides in-depth analysis and guidance to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations. We evaluate legal risks, assist with regulatory filings, and help clients develop robust strategies for operating within the evolving regulatory framework.\n\nWe actively engage in policy development and legislative processes related to crypto and blockchain at national, supranational, and international levels. This includes participating in specialized working groups, contributing opinions to public discussions on regulatory developments, and involvement in policymaking dialogues. We aim to ensure that DeFi stakeholders are represented and protected in the evolving regulatory landscape, facilitating informed and proactive responses to legislative changes.\n\n### Duration & Proposed Budget\n\nWe propose a flexible retainer model for our collaboration, with an initial 6-month commitment. This model is designed to ensure maximum efficiency in resource utilization, with a commitment to transparency and responsible financial management.\n\nThe budget request is $250,000 for a 6-month engagement.\n\nDetailed quarterly reports on our spending will be provided, with any unused funds either carried over to the next quarter or returned to the Aave DAO, as preferred.\n\nOverall, this proposed scope is an opportunity for LlamaRisk to demonstrate its ability to make an appreciable improvement in Aave's risk management, which is a pragmatic and cost-effective onboarding strategy. It also serves as an introduction to building a working relationship with Chaos Labs and DAO stakeholders. We intend to demonstrate our value throughout a 6-month engagement and expand our suite of services as pain points are identified. \n\nWe are a flexible and agile team ready to work together to provide risk management solutions that will suit Aave's specific needs within the wider organization of service providers and stakeholders making up the DAO.\n\n### Useful Links\n\nYou can find in this section links to our work:\n\n- [Curve Gauge Risk Substack](https://cryptorisks.substack.com/) (CryptoRisk Assessments): We publicize research related to assets with Curve pools (mostly stablecoins and RWAs) with attention to risks to the Curve gauge and governance system\n- [PrismaRisk Hackmd](https://hackmd.io/@PrismaRisk): We publicize comprehensive collateral risk assessments for proposed collateral assets on Prisma Finance (LSTs and LRTs)\n- [LlamaRisk Hackmd](https://hackmd.io/@LlamaRisk): We publicize comprehensive collateral risk assessments for potential collateral assets for Curve crvUSD\n- ArcadiaSim: [Update 1](https://cryptorisks.substack.com/p/arcadia-collateral-risk-simulation),  [Update 2](https://cryptorisks.substack.com/p/arcadia-collateral-risk-simulation-d98), [Update 3](https://cryptorisks.substack.com/p/arcadia-collateral-risk-simulation-388), [Update 4](https://cryptorisks.substack.com/p/arcadia-collateral-risk-simulation-42d) & [Update 5](https://cryptorisks.substack.com/p/arcadia-collateral-risk-simulation-3fa)\n- [Sturdy Finance crvUSD Aggregator](https://v2.sturdy.finance/aggregators/ethereum/0x73E4C11B670Ef9C025A030A20b72CB9150E54523/deposit): Sturdy V2 app of the aggregator managed by LlamaRisk\n- [Aggregator Dune Dash](https://dune.com/llamarisk/sturdy-crvusd-aggregator-monitoring): LlamaRisk dashboard monitoring the aggregator and underlying assets\n- [Aggregator Oracle Explainer](https://cryptorisks.substack.com/p/sturdy-finance-crvusd-aggregator): Publication on Sturdy silos Oracle design\n- [Response to FCA Discussion Paper DP23/4](https://cryptorisks.substack.com/p/llama-risk-response-to-fca-discussion): Our response to the UK Financial Conduct Authority's Discussion Paper on Regulating Cryptoassets Phase 1: Stablecoins\n- [DeFi Yield Optimizers](https://cryptorisks.substack.com/p/llama-legal-defi-yield-optimizers): The legal status of DeFi yield optimizers under the EU crypto regulatory framework\n- [SubDAO Legal Entity Formation](https://cryptorisks.substack.com/p/subdao-legal-entity-formation): Llama Risk resources for DAO sub-orgs in search of suitable legal structures\n\n### Disclaimer\n\nThis proposal is powered by Skywards.

        "body": "---\n### [ARFC]  Onboard Catapulta as Aave V3 Deployment Service Provider\n\n### Author:  Kartojal & ACI (Aave Chan Initiative)\n\n### Date: 2024-03-26\n\n---\n\n### **Summary**\n\nThe following proposal is to onboard [Catapulta](https://catapulta.sh/) as a Development Service Provider. The goal of Catapulta is to perform production and testnet Aave V3 instance deployments in EVM networks, approved by the Aave DAO.\n\n### **Motivation**\n\nThe founder of Catapulta, David Racero, worked previously as Solidity Developer in Aave Companies during 2 years and a half, and was the main responsible for deployments scripting of Aave V2 and Aave V3 during the whole time at the company. \n\nCatapulta has created a smart contracts deployments platform that aims to automate certain manual workflows during deployments, like deployments reports, broadcasting txs and verifications in block explorers, allowing to speed up Web3 development cycles.\n\n### Specification\n\nCatapulta, as a potential Development Service Provider to the Aave DAO, will be focusing on the following scope of actions:\n\n- Perform the deployment of new Aave V3 instances in EVM networks, in testnet and production, approved by the Aave DAO via Snapshot.\n- Develop activation proposals for the Aave DAO to initialize Aave V3 instances, following all security procedures.\n- Maintenance of Aave V3 deployment scripting to support new EVM networks.\n\nThe production deployment services will only happen once a positive [technical evaluation](https://governance.aave.com/t/bgd-aave-v3-deployments-technical-evaluation-framework-of-a-network/10237) AND snapshot approval from the Aave DAO.\n\nCatapulta will reject any Aave V3 deployments requests from competitors or forks, and will pursue full transparency during the duration of the services. Catapulta will be in touch with all parties involved during the onboarding of a new Aave V3 instance, ex risk contributors, growth, development and security service providers.\n\n### Duration & Proposed Budget\n\nThe duration for this service proposal will be 6 months.\n\nDue the nature of the proposed services, that will only happen once a positive technical evaluation AND approval from the Aave DAO Governance, Catapulta has opted for a flat fee per production deployment.\n\n- Fixed $15.000 USD in GHO or USDC, plus gas reimbursement, per Aave V3 production deployment, paid at the activation proposal.\n\n### **Useful Links:**\n\n[Catapulta website](https://catapulta.sh/)\n\n**[BGD.

Our goal is to deliver continuous risk management and R&D to the DAO. We aim to maintain and improve Aaveâ€™s strong risk standards and support Aaveâ€™s growth and development with a risk conscious approach.\n\n## Who we are\n\nAllez Labs is a team of data and risk experts with deep experience with Aave and its community since 2019. We have been involved in nearly all risk events that have affected the protocol.\n\n## Allez Labsâ€™ founding members\n\n[Alex BertoG](https://governance.aave.com/u/alex_bertog/summary): Former Risk Lead at Aave Companies, as part of the Genesis team, Alex has been pivotal in establishing and evolving Aave's risk frameworks. Her extensive expertise allowed her to make significant contributions securing Aave's stability and facilitating its growth. Over nearly four years, she was instrumental in establishing the DAO's risk frameworks, setting V1 & initial risk parameters, onboarding risk providers, contributing to Aave's design, managing crises, and supporting the launch of GHO. Socials: [twitter](https://twitter.com/A_BertoG), [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alex-bertomeu-gilles-a1858728/), [lens](https://hey.xyz/u/abertog)\n\n[Khaled G](https://governance.aave.com/u/kakagri): Former senior analyst at Block Analitica, he also worked as a quantitative researcher at Aave Companies for over a year under Alexâ€™s leadership. He contributed to Aave by building quantitative risk frameworks, reviewing and providing feedback to service provider proposals/parameters/methodologies, developed from the ground up a simulation engine for Aave and the relevant DeFi primitives, helped manage crisis situations, contributed to GHOâ€™s initial parameters and designed the first version of the GSM. Socials: [twitter](https://twitter.com/iamkakagri), [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/khaled-grira-math/)\n\nMatt Cole*: Former Staff Engineer (Data Scientist) at Aave Companies for the past two years, working on the risk team and later leading data efforts for Aave and GHO internally. He has constructed comprehensive Aave, GHO, and DeFi databases, assisted protocol engineering through simulations and quantitative analysis, and contributed to risk efforts by estimating impact of parameter changes and responding to crises.

Socials: [twitter](https://twitter.com/0xMC2), [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mattkcole/), [lens\n](https://hey.xyz/u/mcsquared)*available March 29th 2024\n\n## Our Mission\n\nOur mission is simple - to deliver the research, data, and tooling to best position our clients for success in the ever changing DeFi ecosystem. We will achieve this through thoughtful and deep quantitative and qualitative analysis, community engagement and empowerment, and promoting a culture of transparency and collaboration. By integrating these principles into our approach, we envision a future where Aave sets new industry standards for risk management and operational excellence, driving sustainable growth and securing user trust across the DeFi ecosystem.\n\n## Our Values\n\n**Impactful Contribution:** Allez Labs prioritizes areas where our expertise can significantly enhance the protocol's stability and growth. Through strategic focus and dedicated effort, we believe that our work can lead to substantial improvements, driving Aave towards achieving its full potential in the DeFi landscape. Our roadmap adapts based on the most pressing needs of the DAO, and where we can have the greatest impact.\n\n**Community-Centric Innovation:** Our approach to risk management is deeply rooted in serving the community. We utilize transparent, robust methodologies to deliver risk recommendations that are both effective and intuitive, reflecting the dynamic nature of DeFi markets and the needs of the DAO. Allez Labs is committed to democratizing access to risk insights, offering the community tools and reports that require deep expertise and data to build yet are accessible to the wider community. By focusing on clarity, we will empower the community with the knowledge needed for sound decision-making, thereby contributing to a more resilient and vibrant Aave ecosystem.\n\n**Transparency:** We champion transparency as a pillar of the DeFi ecosystem. By fostering the development and adoption of transparent methodologies, such as open sourcing code and frameworks, we aim to create a culture of mutual growth and innovation. This philosophy is rooted in our belief that progress in the DeFi space is a collective journey, propelled by shared knowledge and collaboration.\n\n**Empowering Autonomy:** Central to our ethos is the goal of minimizing dependency on any single service provider, including ourselves. We envision a future where the Aave DAO is equipped with the knowledge and tools to independently manage risk. To this end, we are dedicated to open-sourcing our data pipelines and models, ensuring that our contributions have a lasting impact and support the DAO's journey towards self-reliance. Our objective is clear: to build a foundation that not only serves immediate needs but also empowers future generations of the Aave community.\n\n## Our approach as a risk provider\n\nOur focus is on providing clear, actionable risk management insights that enhance understanding of the interplay between growth opportunities and potential risks. Through transparent methodologies and open communication, we commit to empowering the Aave DAO with the knowledge needed for informed decision-making, thereby fostering a proactive, risk-aware community.\n\nOur mission is aligned with the evolving priorities of the Aave DAO and its stakeholders. Whether the focus shifts towards GHO, Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs), Liquid Restaking Tokens (LRTs), or other areas of interest, Allez Labs is dedicated to adapting our resources to meet these needs. By maintaining a flexible approach, we ensure that while we concentrate on the DAO's current priorities, we also keep a vigilant eye on the broader risk landscape. Our goal is to provide targeted, relevant contributions that not only address immediate concerns but also strengthen Aave's resilience and strategic position in the long term.\n\n# Proposal\n\nAllez Labs proposes to partner with Aave DAO, leveraging our extensive experience in risk management and our commitment to open-source principles to enhance the protocol's stability and growth across Aave V3 and GHO. Our mission is to protect Aave from a broad spectrum of risks through employing a holistic strategy that not only focuses on mitigating immediate threats through qualitative and quantitative modeling, but also on embedding long-term risk management solutions into the protocol's design. With a focus on transparency, community engagement, and open-source development, we pledge to empower the Aave community with the knowledge and tools necessary for informed decision-making, fostering a more robust, inclusive, and thriving ecosystem.\n\n## Scope\n\n**Aave V3**\n\n* **Asset Listing Support:** We will provide analysis for new asset listings on all V3 markets for all assets that pass the Temp Check stage.\n* **New Deployment Risk Assessments:** Aave V3 is now active on 10 chains and we anticipate the DAO will vote to explore additional networks in the upcoming year. As such, we will provide market risk and liquidity assessments for new deployment proposals as well as initial assets and parameterizations for these new networks.\n* **Ad Hoc Parameter Recommendations:** Recognizing Chaos Labs' effective and proactive adjustments to market parameters, Allez Labs will offer supplementary analyses and strategic recommendations for V3 market parameters, targeting enhanced ecosystem stability and refined risk management.\n* **LRT Listing Framework:** As Liquid Restaking Tokens become increasingly popular, Allez Labs will create and publish a LRT listing framework with support from the greater Aave community to best onboard and manage these assets within the Aave ecosystem.\n\n**GHO**\n\n* **Aave V3 Facilitator Parameterization:** This includes parameter recommendations to manage market and liquidity risks, while ensuring GHOâ€™s competitiveness. Parameters to be tuned are borrow cap, interest rates, and stkAAVE discounts.\n* **GHO Peg Stability:** Our team will develop strategies to minimize peg volatility and drive GHO growth through renewed trust in GHOâ€™s stability, allowing for increased GHO borrow caps. We will work with the GHO Liquidity Committee to supply relevant GHO peg analysis and data.\n* **GSM Parameterization:** Adjust the GHO Stability Module parameters to most effectively support GHOâ€™s peg.\n* **Support Cross-Chain GHO Rollout:** Allez Labs will conduct analyses to assess and mitigate risks associated with the cross-chain expansion of GHO, guided by the initiative and framework set by Aave Labs.\n\n**Protocol**\n\n* **Risk Steward:** Take on the role as the second service provider on the risk steward multistig.\n* **Incident Response:** As needed, when emergency security threats arise, we will provide guidance, threat and impact analyses in order to mitigate the threats.\n* **Automated Risk Management:** We will work with other risk providers and stakeholders to begin development of risk parameter automation strategies to streamline the DAOâ€™s risk process where the trade offs are clear. These may include:\n  * Automation around WETH interest rate parameters which are primarily driven by LST yield\n  * Automation around Supply and Borrow caps for new deployments\n\n### Roadmap\n\n* **Immediate:** Ad hoc risk parameter recommendations for V3 Ethereum, Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon, and Avalanche markets, support for GHO related items, assume risk stewardship responsibilities, new deployment risk assessments.\n* **Short-Term Objectives (First 3 Months):** Active risk parameter recommendations on GHO and all remaining active V3 markets, support for GSM parameterization and remaining GHO items. Risk analysis work for cross-chain GHO.\n* **Med-Term Objectives (Following 3 Months):** Automated risk management development report, LRT listing framework publication.\n\n### Requested Budget\n\nFor the operations of Allez Labs over a 6-month period a budget of $400,000 is proposed. This budget will enable us to cover operational costs including, but not limited:\n\n* Legal fees\n* Node and data provider subscriptions\n* Cloud costs\n* Salaries, and hiring of additional analysts and developers as needed\n\n### Terms\n\n* 6-month engagement\n* 400,000 GHO streamed linearly throughout the engagement\n\n## Evaluation Metrics\n\nFrom the DAOâ€™s experience with service providers, inspired by BGDs proposal, the following metrics are good measures of performance:\n\n* Monthly recaps of Allez Labsâ€™ contributions to the DAO with tracking of the progress on the scope and various contributions.\n* Provable participation and/or delivery of the projects described in the scope.\n* Direct or indirect participation in projects of other fields of contribution.\n* Feedback from other contributors and DAO members.\n* Direct and transparent engagement with the DAO via this governance forum.\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. Engage with the community and other service provides to refine the proposal\n2. Escalate the proposal strengthened by stakeholdersâ€™ feedback to ARFC\n3. Execution upon approval\n4. Immediate support for GHO, Aave V3 Ethereum, Arbitrum, Polygon, Optimism and Avalanche.\n5. Support for all Aave V3 markets along the timeline proposed.\n\n\n\n\n*Copyright and related rights waived under [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)*",
