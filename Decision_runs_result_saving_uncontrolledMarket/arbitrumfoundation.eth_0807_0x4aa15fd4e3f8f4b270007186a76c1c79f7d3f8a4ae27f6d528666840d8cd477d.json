        "title": "Arbitrum DAO Grants - Delegated Domain Allocation by Questbook",
        "author": "0xb29A655f3D67B2B6724Fb22B2C2303cB660c946B",
        "body": "Author\nSaurabh, Questbook \n\nType \n**Non-Constitutional**\n\n### **Abstract**\n\n- We propose Arbitrum DAO to launch Arbitrum grants program with a budget of $1M spread across 2 quarters to fund a *wide variety* of teams building apps on top of Arbitrum in a transparent manner. Questbook is leading [Compound](https://compound.finance/governance/proposals/136) grants program through [delegated domain capital allocation model](https://blog.questbook.xyz/posts/min-grants-dao-max-community-participation/) , a community-run grants program.\n- We additionally propose that this budget be managed by **4** **individuals called Domain Allocators - chosen from the community and by the community**. These domain allocators would manage grants for a *domain*. These domains are strategic areas of focus for which Arbitrum wants to disburse grants\n- The performance of each of these *domain allocators* will be publicly viewable and auditable using rich dashboards. At the end of the quarter, the Arbitrum community can vote to replace, continue domain allocators or increase budgets for each *domain allocator.*\n- We ([Questbook.xyz](https://questbook.xyz/) ) **will help facilitate setting up these *domain allocators* and provide the tooling to run the grants program in an efficient and transparent way**. We have previously set up or currently setting up the grants process for Compound, Polygon, Solana, Celo, and Aave.\n\n### **Motivation**\n\nAs we continue to experience the depth of the bear market, it is increasingly important for Arbitrum to retain the mindshare of key ecosystem contributors and incentivize builders to build on top of it. Grants program is a great way to attract high-quality builders and grow the ecosystem more quickly. This proposal details the benefit to all the stakeholders involved - token holders, builders and DAO members\n### **Rationale** **(Benefits to Arbitrum)**\n\nThe proposed structure will lead to the following outcomes:\n\n1. **Aligned allocation of funds:** By leveraging the Delegated Domain Allocator (DDA) model, Arbitrum DAO can ensure that funds are allocated to projects that align with the domain (selected by the Arbitrum community), promoting efficient and effective use of resources. This approach aligns with Arbitrum’s goal of enabling the distribution of grants and empower the community to build and participate in the future of the Arbitrum.\n2. **Increased transparency:** The Delegated Domain Allocator approach provides a clear and transparent process for allocating funds, ensuring stakeholders understand the decision-making process and building community confidence. Questbook, a decentralized grant management platform, provides a transparent space for teams to showcase their backgrounds and experience. In addition, Questbook’s reporting features will allow Arbitrum to quickly generate monthly reports on the allocation of funds, with the details for each grant proposal.\n3. **Increased accountability:** With a dedicated group of stakeholders responsible for allocating funds, the Delegated Domain Allocator approach promotes increased accountability, ensuring that the funds are used effectively and efficiently. Domain allocators can be replaced through a community vote if their performance is not up to the standards accepted by the community.\n4. **Lower** **Turnaround Time (TAT):** The Delegated Domain Capital Allocation model will help improve proposals’ turnaround time and overall outcomes for the ecosystem. **An example of this is Compound who’s already leveraging the DDA model and has a communication TAT of less than 48 hours.** The performance of domain allocators will be measured using objectives and key results (OKRs) to ensure goals are achieved efficiently and effectively.\n5. **Strong Brand Recognition** : The Delegated Domain Allocator model will play a crucial role in boosting developer engagement with Arbitrum, as well as forming strategic partnerships with important ecosystems to jointly fund grants in mutually beneficial areas. \n\n### **Specifications**\n\nThe program structure focuses on having community members as domain allocators. Arbitrum DAO will be required to set a budget of $1M to be disbursed by 4 domain allocators and for committee compensation. Each domain allocator will be elected by the community. Interested community members can self-nominate themselves to be considered for becoming a domain allocator. The domain allocator for each domain will be selected via a community-wide Snapshot vote. Domain allocators will run their domain on-chain for full transparency. The data and performance across key metrics will be visible to the community in order to evaluate the domain allocator’s performance.\n\n### **Steps to Implement**\n\n**Arbitrum Grants Committee**\n\nThe program will consist of\n\n1. A Program Manager\n2. 4 Domain Allocators\n\n \n![1.1.png](ipfs://bafkreicew52tsgud3subrurhrv6jud3zyep743fpgfiv4yzw54nnty423m)\n    \n\nWe propose  [Tally’s Zodiac Governor Module](https://docs.tally.xyz/user-guides/using-governor-with-gnosis-safe/zodiac-governor-module-for-subdaos-and-grants-programs) for security purposes. Furthermore, a Grants SAFE with 4/6 multi-sig will be set up between the program manager and 4 domain allocators. We will then have 4 SAFEs for each of the domains with a 3/3 multi-sig setup between the program manager, the specific domain allocator, and one member from the DAO.\n\nWe have identified the following domains based on our thorough research and the feedback from the Arbitrum team and community.\n\n![1.2.png](ipfs://bafkreifk7yaqw2lvwj35tx2rumagctyd3of6nd2bh3fawsiij74bmdlyv4)\n\n## Domain Allocator Roles & Responsibilities:\n\nThe following will be the roles and responsibilities of the selected domain allocators.\n\n1. Time commitment per week: Maximum of 25 hours per week for the program manager and 15 hours per week for the domain allocator, which might vary based on the number of applications. The program manager will ensure that the workload is evenly distributed\n2. Program Manager:\n    1. Communication:\n        1. Work with the Arbitrum team and the elected domain allocators to create and list out the necessary RFPs\n        2. Identify key areas and relevant ecosystem partners who will co-fund grants alongside Arbitrum\n        3. Create marketing content for communicating RPFs to the builders\n        4. Coordinate between Arbitrum team and the community regarding cohort announcement and funding requirements\n        5. Communicate the information regarding approval/rejection of proposals to the Arbitrum community regularly\n        6. Attend community calls, actively participate in the community forum, and keep the community updated and take their feedback on the program\n        7. Regularly update the progress of the grants program to the Arbitrum community over Discord and community calls\n        8. Bi-weekly reporting of key metrics of the grants program and progress each selected project such as:\n  \n \n![13a.png](ipfs://bafybeihd4opx3atmhvarhrd5t6edpmpyfi4m6ptblpl4siihpqip5qh2wu)\n    \n    \n\n2. Grants Program: \na. Source good-quality proposals from developer communities\nb. Sign the transactions for the approved projects\nc. Ensure a quick turnaround time for proposers regarding their proposal decision\nd. Coordinate between the domain allocators to ensure that the workload is evenly distributed and take their feedback consistently\n\n3. Domain Allocator:\n    1. Review proposals received for their domains based on the rubrics set by the domain allocator\n    2. Reject/Approve proposals and coordinate consistently with the program manager\n    3. Source applications by reaching out to developer communities in their network\n    4. Discuss program improvements with the other domain allocators and program manager during scheduled meetings.\n\n### **Compensation:**\n\nThe grant budget will be $1M with $200k for each domain. The committee compensation will be $200K for 4 domain allocators and one program manager for 6 months. Note that this is the proposed budget. All unallocated funds from every domain and committee compensation will be returned to the treasury. The compensation for Domain Allocators and Program Managers has been factored into this overall proposed budget. Please find below its details.\n \n![14aaa.png](ipfs://bafybeig7zsa7e7vdk7zdnmspuq4z6ciajxorckhiy3ckpro4xfcv6ycheq)\n    \nP.S\n\n1. We are inviting applications for all domain allocator roles. Once this proposal passes through Snapshot, we will create a separate forum post for the nomination of domain allocators. Delegates and community members can self-nominate themselves under the post for two weeks. After the nomination period, a snapshot vote will be conducted.\n\n## **What does success look like?**\n\nObjective\n1. The prime objective of this model is to have domains that align with Arbitrum’s priorities. This way the contribution of the projects as part of the grants program is directly adding value to the DAO and the token holders.\n2. Increase in the number of builders, proposals, and funded projects\n3. Number of partners who are co-funding grants alongside Arbitrum in mutually beneficial areas\n4. Increase in the homegrown leadership to run grant programs (measured by the number of people running grant programs)\n5. Increase in the community members’ participation to keep grant programs accountable (measured by the number of people looking at the dashboard and participating in the program)\n6. Diversity in projects being funded across technologies, geographies, and demographics, to name a few. We encourage the community to regularly review the project domains during Arbitrum’s community call\n7. Increased engagement in builder community’s\nDiscourse\nDiscord, Telegram\nSocial media (Twitter, Reddit)\nGitHub\n\nSubjective\n1. Improved community involvement in the grants program\n2. Strengthened builders’ sentiment towards Arbitrum\n3. Enhanced Arbitrum’s brand recognition in builder circles\n\n## **About Questbook:**\n\nQuestbook’s role in Arbitrum’s Grant Program\n\n- Saurabh from Questbook will be the program manager. Thereafter, the program manager will be elected from the community. Saurabh was previously working very closely with the Program manager of Polygon, where he facilitated the disbursement of approximately $1 million in grants. Saurabh has received a grant from IoTeX to establish their grant program, and he works closely with the Program Manager of Compound Grants Program 2.0. Saurabh has spoken to more than 100 builders and teams over the last 6-8 months and understands what it takes to make a grant program successful - from both program manager and builder perspectives.\n- Questbook Grants tool will make sure the workflows are systematic and transparent.\n\n### Product Flows\n\n1.

        "author": "0xF92F185AbD9E00F56cb11B0b709029633d1E37B4",
        "body": "Note: This proposal has been posted on behalf of the Arbitrum Incentives Working Group as a result of multiple community calls and workshops between multiple stakeholders. It does not exclude external incentive proposals from outside of the proposed structure.*\n\n**Abstract**\nThis proposal outlines a one-time, community-created program to distribute up to 75,000,000 ARB of DAO-funded incentives targeting active Arbitrum protocols. Aimed at fulfilling short-term community needs, the program plans to allocate DAO-owned ARB towards incentives while ensuring transparent consensus and distribution methods. It spans two voting rounds and provides incentives to eligible programs designed to fund incentives through the January 31, 2024. It asks all participating grantees to self report data, and dashboards, summarizing grant performance.\n\n**Motivation**\nThis provisional framework aims to distribute incentives fairly and effectively using transparent criteria agreed upon by the community, while a thorough system is developed (1 19, 2 7, 3 4, 4 5).\nThe goals of the program are to:\n•\tSupport Network Growth: Accelerate the distribution of incentives to Arbitrum dApps to drive network and ecosystem growth.\n•\tExperiment with Incentive Grants: Experiment with grant distribution to uncover new incentive strategies that increase user engagement and increase volume, transactions, and liquidity in the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n•\tFind new models for grants and developer support that generate maximum activity on the Arbitrum network.\n•\tCreate Incentive Data: Generate data on the efficacy of distributed grants to inform future incentive programs and incentive design.\n\n**Rationale**\nBy incentivizing the use of existing Arbitrum dApps through this proposal, we anticipate increased volume, transactions, users, and liquidity, laying the groundwork for a dynamic ecosystem. While the proposal acts as an experimental program, its primary goal is to ensure basic safeguards while promoting innovative incentive strategies.\n\nGiven that this proposal aims to be a one-time, short term incentive distribution, it lacks the accountability and operational rigor that a full program may provide. As such, we encourage protocols to consider that the use of funds will be both evaluated, and monitored by the community. Any misbehavior, or failure to comply with grant requests will likely result in ineligibility, or at the very least significant discernment, in future incentive or grant programs.\n\n**Specifications**\nThe Arbitrum Short-Term Incentive Program will comprise up to a 75,000,000 ARB budget earmarked for incentive grants for eligible protocols. In order to expedite the distribution of this capital to the ecosystem, the DAO will adopt a bifurcated process comprising two separate processes: the Financial Proposal and Application Process.\n\n**Steps to Implement**\n \n![8b05a5d34faf8659a144f1d35081a89ae83e237e.png](ipfs://bafkreiaizvrpzwo5bn6lxl5ikdywhfakyphtdukgkywpuzpvlrokaaj2oe)\n     \nFollowing a successful Snapshot Temperature Check, the DAO will launch an expedited application and review process, allowing applicants to apply for grants concurrent with the on-chain vote to distribute DAO funds from the treasury.\n\nThe Snapshot Temperature Check will be designed to both achieve consensus and approve funding across four options, where each vote will distinguish support of up to X ARB through the end of January 31, 2024:\n•\tFor up to **25M ARB** through January 31, 2024.\n•\tFor up to **50M ARB** through January 31, 2024.\n•\tFor up to **75M ARB** through January 31, 2024.\n•\tAgainst.\n\n**Financial Proposal**\nThe Financial Proposal will comprise the following:\n•\tA ratification of the Arbitrum Short-Term Incentive Program and application template 37 as articulated in this document.\n•\tApproval of the eligibility criteria, grant budget parameters, distribution strategy, and evaluation requirements.\n•\tA 25,000,000, 50,000,000 or 75,000,000 ARB distribution to the program Multisig.\n•\tA 32,000 ARB operational budget for community/project facilitation.\no\t20,000 ARB to @tnorm as retroactive payment for conducting community moderation:\n\tDraft and review of multiple iterations of incentive proposals.\n\tModeration of community calls and working group telegram.\n\tCoordination individually across dozens of stakeholders and community members over the past three weeks.\no\t12,000 ARB Multisig Signers (A new version of the PL-ARB Grants Safety Multisig 17 - 2K per signer).\n\n**Multisig Setup**\nA new multisig will be created with the signers from the original pl-ARB multisig, under the name of the Arbitrum DAO. The new multisig will include two features to ensure accountability of signers and grantees:\n\n1.\tClawback capability so the DAO can retrieve funds if the multisig violates the agreement.\n2.\tStreaming of funds to grantees every second week for the grants duration using Hedgey. This allows for the halting of funds if misuse is discovered with the goal to stop bad actors, not punish bad designs.\n\n**What are the Eligibility Requirements?**\n\nGrant Requirements:\n•\tGrantees are required to keep distributions in ARB without converting to other assets.\n•\tGrantees must not farm their own incentive programs.\n•\tGrantees must outline a spending plan, provide a pro forma, and state the grant’s objective.\n•\tGrantees must commit to providing data on distributions, all ARB spending transactions, and key metrics like daily TVL, transactions, volumes, unique addresses, and transaction fees. This data should cover 30 days before, during, and after the Incentivization period, and be presented preferably in a Dune Spell/dashboard or alternatively in a report.\n•\tGrantees must agree to share all contract addresses being used to distribute incentive rewards.\n•\tGrantees must disclose the contracts being incentivized and denote any external contracts being incentivized as part of the program.\n•\tGrantees can only incentive contracts on the Arbitrum Network.\n•\tGrants are not to be used in DAO governance.\n•\tGrantees are expected to not encourage or partake in sybil attacks against the forum to sway community opinion.\n•\tGrantees must agree to KYC with the Arbitrum Foundation in order to receive funds.\n•\tGrantees must apply using the approved program application template 15.\n\nBy streaming grant payments, the multisig will be empowered to hold grantees accountable to their proposals by halting fund streaming for any of the following reasons:\n\n•\tAny use of funds not explicitly described in the grantees application.\n•\tFailure to comply with data reporting standards.\no\tGrantee recipients will be required to provide Dune dashboards uploaded and posted to the forum by eligible teams by December 15, 2023.\n•\t•\tDashboard requirements are: Daily TVL, transactions, volumes, unique addresses, and transaction fees for incentivized protocols. This data should cover 30 days before, during, and after the Incentivization period. If a metric does not apply, or this is not achievable, it should be noted in the application.\n•\t•\tMore granular dashboards (including pool-level and user analysis) will be noted by the community for future programs.\no\tIf dashboards are not posted by this date, the multisig will be empowered to halt incentive funding streams for protocols at their discretion.\nIn that this proposal aims to be experimental, the multisig is not intended to provide quality control on the design of incentive programs. Rather, they are empowered to halt streaming in the event of negligence or misuse of funds.\n\n**Eligibility and Evaluation Guidelines**\nGrants span two award cycles, but projects can only be awarded once. Projects rejected in the first cycle are invited to address delegate/community feedback and reapply for the second cycle.\nProtocols can submit grant applications for amounts they feel appropriate. While there’s no ARB limit, delegates and voters will assess each grant individually.\nAs such, the Arbitrum Working Group has included four grant categories, as well as some recommended metrics by which the community might consider evaluating the grants:\n\n•\t**Beacon Grants (<= 200K ARB)**\no\tRecommendations:\n\tLive on Arbitrum for at least 2 months.\n\tMeets one of the following criteria:\n\t.> $1.5M TVL.\n\t.>$2M 30D cumulative Volume.\n\n•\t**Siren Grants (Up to 750K ARB)**\no\tRecommendations:\n\tLive on Arbitrum for at least 4 months.\n\tMeets one of the following criteria:\n\t.> $4M TVL.\n\t.>$40M 30D cumulative Volume.\n\n•\t**Lighthouse Grants* (Up to 2M ARB)**\no\tRecommendations:\n\tLive on Arbitrum for at least 6 months.\n\tMeets one of the following criteria:\n\t.> $15M Arbitrum Network TVL.\n\t.> $100M 30D cumulative Volume.\n\n•\t**Pinnacle Grants* (> 2M ARB)**\no\tRecommendations:\n\tLive on Arbitrum for at least 12 months\n\tMeets one of the following criteria\n\t.> $30M Arbitrum Network TVL\n\t.> $200M 30D cumulative volume\n\n*Grants greater than $1M ARB will be asked to include milestone-based funding tranches in their application.\n\nOne could reasonably use the date of publication for this proposal to inform these metrics.\n\n**Steps to Implement (How does the DAO Approve Grants)?**\nGrants will be approved via a three week process across two cycles.\n\nCycle 1\n1.\tApplication Period (1 Week):\nDuring the Application Stage of the program, eligible protocols will be invited to post proposals in the “Incentive Grant Applications” Category of the Arbitrum Forum using the official Application Template 20.\nOnce posted, the community may provide feedback on the proposal through the end of the Review Period.\n\n2.\tReview Period (1 Week):\nDelegates and network stakeholders will be asked to provide feedback on grant applications upon each specific forum post. Delegates should engage with the goal of ensuring the responsible use of funds. This means an application should represent a comprehensive strategy for incentive distribution, align with the program goals and requirements, and present their plan to adhere to the aforementioned data standards.\nApplicants are expected to adjust, amend, and update their proposals in line with community feedback over this time period. Due to the accelerated timeline of the program, feedback and communication between delegates and applicants will be critical.\n\n3.\tVoting Period (1 Week):\nA delegate will sponsor the proposal throughout the governance process for each grant application. ARB holders and ARB delegates will be invited to vote on each submitted proposal via Snapshot Poll.\nTo succeed, eligible applications must receive a greater than 50% majority in favor of the proposal, and receive greater than 71.51 million ARB in favor of the application. If successful, applicants will coordinate with the Arbitrum Foundation and the PL-ARB multisig to secure the completion of KYC, and receive funding to the address included in their application.\n\nCycle 2\nRepeat the process outlined in Cycle 1, with the exception that the review period for the second round will comprise a 2 week review period.\n\n**Timeline**\n[See image above]\nSep. 01, 2023 - Forum Post\nSep. 09, 2023 - Snapshot Vote Begins\n\nCycle 1\nSep. 16, 2023 - On-Chain Vote and Application Period\nSep. 23, 2023 - Review Period Begins\nSep. 30, 2023 - Voting Round Begins\nOct. 07, 2023 - Funds Distributed\n\nCycle 2\nOct 07, 2023 - Application Period 2 Begins\nOct 14, 2023 - Review Period 2 Begins\nOct 28, 2023 - Voting Round 2 Begins\nNov. 04, 2023 - Funds Distributed\n\n**Overall Cost**\nUp to 75,032,000 ARB.\n\n**Outstanding Questions and Concerns**\n\nWhat happens if the budget is exceeded?\nWe do not expect applications to exceed the funding budget of 75M ARB. However, if requested grants do exceed the allocated budget, funding will be allocated on a first-come, first-serve basis dependent upon the time the proposal was submitted to the Arbitrum Forum. In the event that the budget is exceeded, the DAO may choose to unlock further funds for a third round, or backfund successful incentive proposals.\n\nWhat will happen to excess funds?\nFollowing Cycle 2, excess funds remaining in the multisig will be returned to the Arbitrum Treasury address by the multisig.\n\nWhat is the plan after the Short Term Incentive Program?\nThe Short Term Incentive Program is designed specifically as a one-time program, with the intention of allowing incentives while the DAO designs a more robust, sustainable program in the months throughout the end of the year.\nAt the end of the year, if there is no program in place, protocols can put forth direct votes to on-chain governance to extend their programs. This program offers an opportunity for participating protocols to demonstrate mission-aligned conduct as justification for future funding.\n\nWhat are the specific KPIs for this program - what determines its success?\n•\tCommunity Support: The primary KPI for this proposal is aligning with both delegates and protocols to agree on the distribution of funds through the end of 2023, with an agreement to work towards a more efficient, comprehensive, and effective program in 2024.\n•\tNetwork Activity: An increase in network metrics such as TVL, Volume, Users and Transactions on the incentivized protocols in addition to an increase in general network activity.\n•\tCommunity Awareness: Raised awareness, collaboration, and understanding of incentive distribution strategies and tactics.\n•\tIncentives Data: Increased data on incentives, grants, and protocol behavior to inform future Arbitrum incentive programs and iterations.\n\n**Forum Link **\n\nThis snapshot is replication of the forum post.

        "body": "## Abstract\n\nThis proposal introduces the STIP Bridge, aiming to sustain and enhance Arbitrum's market leadership by extending support to key protocols amidst intense competition from other Layer 2 solutions. \n\nIt serves as a strategic interim solution, maintaining incentive alignment and ensuring continuous engagement of vital projects within the Arbitrum ecosystem until the Perpetual Incentives Program is initiated.\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe Arbitrum ecosystem is currently facing unprecedented competitive pressures, with significant incentive programs launched by rival Layer 2 networks threatening to attract our established protocols away. \n\nThe STIP Bridge is crucial for retaining these integral projects, ensuring they remain committed to Arbitrum by providing timely, targeted incentives. This initiative is essential to preserve network growth, user engagement, and overall ecosystem stability in a highly dynamic market environment.\n\n## Rationale\n\nAligning with Arbitrum's mission to support and nurture its development community, the STIP Bridge embodies our commitment to our builders and their contributions. It strategically addresses the imminent risk of losing key ecosystem participants to competitors by offering a seamless transition in incentive support. This approach not only retains critical projects and liquidity within Arbitrum but also sets a solid foundation for the impending comprehensive Perpetual Incentives Program, reinforcing our long-term vision of innovation and community empowerment.\n\n# Specifications\n\n## Eligibility\n\n* Any protocol funded under STIP is eligible to apply for a bridge grant coinciding with the LTIPP distribution window.\n* This will allow Arbitrum to ensure protocols that had success during the STIP campaign can retain their users and continue to focus on building on Arbitrum.\n\n## Maximum Funding Size:\n\nMaximum funding requests under this bridge grant are capped based on a percentage of the prior funding received under STIP:\n\n* Greater than 500k ARB: may make a funding request of up to 50% of their prior funding.\n* Less than or equal to 500k ARB: may make funding requests up to 100% of their prior funding, capped at 250k ARB.\n\n## Addendum on STIP Forum post:\n\nAfter applying with an addendum on the respective project’s original STIP forum post, projects will be included in a list of all extension applicants. Specifically, a project should add the tag “STIP Bridge” to the end of their forum post. The addendum is intended to be relatively lightweight, not requiring a full STIP type proposal but should still include:\n\n* Requested amount (protocols have the option to size down their asks if they deem it more appropriate, including to help secure the support of delegates).\n* Data on the performance of their activities during STIP.\n* If the intended use of incentives is different than STIP, then details of the updated usage.\n* Links to bi-weekly STIP performance reports and Openblocks Dashboard.\n\n## Voting and Approval Mechanism:\n\n### Optimistic Approach\n\nAn optimistic voting mechanism will be used to mitigate the potential for delegate fatigue from voting on 50+ proposals while still holding projects accountable for their overall performance within STIP and in general.\n\nThis optimistic model hopes to reduce the load on all delegates but ensure that the DAO's full attention is placed on the more contentious proposals.\n\n### Voting Mechanism\n\nThe current snapshot and the immediately subsequent Tally vote will earmark funds to allow the DAO to distribute up to the maximum permissible grants.\n\nAfter applying with an addendum on the respective project's original STIP forum post, all properly submitted projects will be included in a list of extension applicants for consideration to be funded.\n\nDuring the challenge review period, any delegate with at least 500K ARB delegated can put up a forum post and an associated snapshot proposal that will result in a full DAO vote for the individual grant streams for it to be approved.  \n\nDelegates may seek a full DAO vote at their own discretion if they believe that a project did (a) not fulfill their STIP requirements, (b) failed to deliver tangible results during the STIP period or (c) the amount sought in the bridge application would not result in an effective utilization of the DAO’s funds.\n\nThis will allow the DAO delegates to focus their available attention to more closely examine contested applications. To be accepted into the bridge program alongside the unchallenged proposals, the proposal to fund must receive a supermajority (66%) of votes in favor.\n\n# Steps to Implement\n\n* Send funds to STIP multisig\n* Create an addendum template for applicants\n* Have applicants post addendums\n* Conduct DAO challenge vote on Snapshot\n* Conduct individual Snapshot votes for any challenged application\n* Have successful applicants complete compliance\n* Start streams at the same time as LTIPP protocols\n* Monitored incentives throughout the program as done in STIP\n\n# Timeline\n\nThis is a rough timeline. We aim to start the STIP Bridge at the same time as LTIPP.\n\n* Week 1 (March 11 - 17)\n  * Posted to Governance Forum\n  * If requested, Community Call including discussion of Voting Mechanism\n* Week 2 (March 22 - 29)\n  * Snapshot Vote for the creation of Bridge Program\n* Week 3\n  * Tally Vote for establishing funding to LTIPP or community multisig (17 days)\n  * Start of 2-week window for protocols to submit addendums, protocols are encouraged but not obligated to submit early to allow delegates time to review\n* Week 4\n  * Continue addendum submissions\n* Week 5\n  * One week Optimistic Approval / Challenge Vote Period\n* Week 6\n  * Tally vote ends (17 days)\n  * Review and discussion period of remaining protocols not cleared in Optimistic / Challenge voting\n  * Vote on remaining contested applicants\n* Week 6\n  * STIP.b & LTIPP incentives start at the same time\n\n# Overall Cost\n\n\n## Incentives Budget: \n37,025,522 ARB\nSee estimated amounts [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ic15cTQNoa6xyIJcp-X8OC175MaCLMPrXtMW5eT87sI/edit#gid=1867228162)\n\nThe incentives budget above is the maximum allocation earmarked, any extra funds not used due to ineligible asks, projects not applying, or other reasons returned to the multisig. \n\n### Overhead: 0M ARB\n\n\n* Assumed to be the same data provider and multisig as STIP without added cost.\n* Analytics: This proposal should result in no material increase in work for the analytics vendor, given that the same team already covers STIP protocols, was mandated for making dashboards for the same, and is mandated for the entire time of LTIPP. Additionally, the multisig signing can be done at the same time as other disbursements or will use oSnap reducing the need for multi-sig signing.\n* If there is an objection, a volunteer multisig from the DAO will be assembled and community grants can be allocated by the LTIPP special grants for taking over the existing dashboards from STIP, as they are open source and IP rights if any already resides with the DAO.\n\n## Proposers:\nIncludes some proposers and developers of both STIP round 1, Backfund, LTIP and an LTIP Council member. \nAlex Lumley of SavvyDao, Dan Peng of Vela Exchange, CoinflipCanada of GMX",

        "body": "## **Summary**\n\nAs we near the end of allocating the initial grant budget (link to proposal), where through the [Arbitrum Grants Program ](https://arbitrum.questbook.app/) run via the Delegated Domain Allocation model by Questbook, $912k has already been allocated to over 60 proposals. Based on the overwhelming response and number of quality proposals the grant program has received, we propose to start a new program for the Arbitrum Grants via DDA through Questbook with a budget of $4,000,000 spread across 4 domains over the next two quarters. We have received great feedback and support from the community, builders, and domain allocators for requesting additional budget and continue funding projects through the delegated domain allocation model.\n\n### **Proposal**\n\nBased on the impact and insights derived from Arbitrum DDA program, we propose renewing the Program with a budget of $4M for two quarters. The domain allocators will utilize this budget to fund proposals that align with Arbitrum’s roadmap. After researching, gathering feedback from domain allocators, active community members, and builders, we propose supporting the same domains as the previous program:\n\n|Domain|Domain Allocator|Proposed Budget|\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|New Protocol Ideas|Jojo|$920,000|\n|Gaming|Adam|$920,000|\n|Dev Tooling|Juandi|$920,000|\n|Education, Growth, Community and Events|Cattin (Seed Latam)|$920,000|\n\n**RFPs, acceptance criteria and specifications for each domain**\n\n1. New Protocol Ideas - [Link ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/120s88WVycDyP2pUfgcT0eE8ILuribuayHDnd5aeZxbM/edit#heading=h.4th1bgre9sv4)\n2. Gaming - [Link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UIQA_kGeLsXQOZsIiGaNzE35TRTbqXBl5JauNt4LECQ/edit#heading=h.ig7e612gb5vt)\n3. Dev Tooling - [Link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/144gTfeKKXOtPxMTEB9d73wELepJ9mNPjMJHjvCSy3uE/edit)\n4. Education, Growth, Community and Events - [Link](https://www.notion.so/e8e86fbd9ee349beb0d9046607dae812?pvs=21)\n\n* We propose increasing the allocated grants budget for all domains equally to a higher budget based on the number of proposals received in the previous round.\n* Additionally, in the first round we set a soft cap of $25,000, and we propose increasing the cap to $50,000, with a few more steps for approving a grant that is larger than $25,000, requiring the involvement of two DAs to approve a proposal rather than just the specific domain allocator.\n* Considering the previous softcap being half of what is currently proposed, and that for an average of $220,000 for each domain the program was able to run for around 3.5 months before being maxed out, we project that providing 4X the amount of the previous iteration to each domain should allow the program to constantly allocate, at the same rate or even higher, for the full 6 months projected duration\n* The increased cap will allow the Questbook Program to keep covering the bootstrap belt of grant between $1,000 to $25,000 while, at the same time, be able to serve larger protocols that inherently might have larger needs.\n\n### Specifications and Implementation\n\nSimilar to the model implemented in the initial program, the renewed grants program will be run using **[Delegated Domain Capital Allocation Model 1](https://blog.questbook.xyz/posts/min-grants-dao-max-community-participation/)**. Each *domain allocator* will run their respective domain on-chain for full transparency using Questbook. The data and performance across key metrics will be visible to the community.\n\nWhile the program has produced, accordingly to preliminary conversation with protocols and delegates, good results, we want to address and integrate the feedbacks so far proposed and partially covered in the previous section, such as:\n\n* have better accountability for the increased soft cap\n* define a more robust and structured set of rules for applicants, in regards to providing a timeline for their project(s)\n* define a cost for the management and verification of milestones after the program is completed\n* define a plan to manage the volatility of funds being distributed by the DAO in ARB token.\n\nThe DA will evaluate all the proposals through the rubrics provided for each domain, with the following framework:\n\n* in case of request below or equal to $25,000, the evaluation process will be the same of the previous iteration, with rubrics being evaluated and scored by the specific DA\n* in case of request above $25,000, and below the new soft cap of $50,000, the evaluation will involve a second DA, chosen by the first one based on the proximity of the specific expertise and knowledge to that proposal, that will have to publish a second evaluation of the rubrics alongside the score. Assuming N rubrics, scored from 1 to 5, the grant will be approved only if both the DA will give each a scoring equal or above to N*3.\n\nThe disbursement of the grant will take place on-chain from a multi-sig wallet controlled by the program manager & the domain allocator. The domain allocator will approve or reject the application based on evaluation rubric. A Grants SAFE, with 3/5 multi-sig, between the program manager and 4 domain allocators will be setup. We will then have 4 SAFEs for each of the domains with a 2/2 between the program manager and the specific domain allocator. The funds for the grants program will flow from the treasury into the Grants SAFE. This SAFE will hold the funds related to operational costs, committee compensation, and the grants budget. Funds that will be disbursed to the proposers will reside in the domain-level SAFEs.\n\nAfter the end of two quarters, the grants committee and the Arbitrum community shall evaluate the performance of each domain using publicly available data and decide to eventually, renew the program and, if so, change any specification of the domains, the domain allocators or the program manager.\n\nTo ensure predictability of the funding of the program and a proper runaway, upon receiving the amount from the DAO, the DAs alongside the PM will convert it in stables. If the protocols request it, specific grants or milestones might be paid in $ARB by converting the needed amount at the moment of payout.\n\nArbitrum DDA program closed accepting new proposals from mid February. If the program will be renewed in the terms above, the DDA program will take care, alongside the evaluation of new proposal, to keep evaluating the milestones of the previous program, thus allowing for the continuity of the previous iteration in an accountable way for grantees.\n\n### Compensation\n\nWe propose the following payment structure for the PM and DAs, with a base salary of $100/h and an increased projected workload of DA by 33% compared to the previous program, in consideration of the fact that DA not only have on average worked more than what initially was expected in the previous program, but also that they will need to spend time to cross evaluate all proposals above $25,000. On the other hand, the compensation of the PM is instead unchanged.\nWe are also adding overhead for an extra 6 months, equivalent to 20% of full-time salaries, for the Domain Allocators and the PM to keep evaluating the milestones of the grantees after the natural end of the program. This will ensure the proper continuation of the program and the followup with grantees, despite the program potentially not being renewed if so decided by the DAO. In case the program would be renewed with the same structure and people, or in case the milestone verification would come to an end before the due time, any leftover would be given back to the Arbitrum DAO.\n\n|Role|Monthly Cost|Total|\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|Program Manager and Questbook|$10000|$60,000*|\n|Domain Allocator|$8000|$192,000|\n|Overhead for extra 6 months|$8400|$50,400|\n|Operations Cost, Misc.||$10,000|\n||Totals:|$312,400|\n\n*Note: Questbook will provide the grants committee its grants orchestration tool at a cost of $5000 per month, included in the numbers above with the PM’s payment.\n\nAs per the above, the current costs to run program would be 7.8% of the overall budget of the grant program.\n\n* We suggest that the grants committee continue with [Synapse ](https://www.synaps.io/) for KYC services and [Docusign](https://www.docusign.com/en-in) for all contractual agreements, as we have been using these services throughout the Arbitrum DDA program 1.\n* However, for any specific asks from the grants team in order to run the process more smoothly, Questbook will charge for any additional feature requests based on the development overhead through a retrospective grant proposal from Arbitrum at the end of two quarters.\n\n### Read the whole proposal on the forum for Domain Allocator roles, responsibilities, KPIs, and Expectations",

        "author": "0x1B686eE8E31c5959D9F5BBd8122a58682788eeaD",
        "body": "TL;DR : This framework supports the budding RWA ecosystem on Arbitrum by diversifying 35 million ARB from our treasury (~1%) into stable & liquid bills or money market instruments earning a rate of return roughly equivalent to US Treasuries (hereby called ‘stable RWAs’)\n\nThis proposal is a trial run for a larger investment policy of the ArbitrumDAO treasury, both in: \n1. Creating a legal and infrastructural pipeline that future diversification proposals can take guidance from and\n2. Proof of concept that we can diversify our treasury in a way that supports ecosystem growth\n\nThis is NOT a grant; it is an investment that Arbitrum governance can exercise control over and recall, subject to agreed-upon conditions with a successful applicant.\n\n### Overview\n\nThe Stable Treasury Endowment Program (STEP) is the first proposal floated by the Treasury WG before the DAO. We are targeting stable RWAs backed by t-bills or money market instruments as the 1st step towards larger treasury diversification for several reasons;\n1. Once we figure out how to hold stable RWAs on our books, we can easily diversify based on best practices rather than procedural considerations. The stable coins we use today in De-Fi are mostly backed by t-bill RWAs; creating our own exposure can increase capital efficiency and mitigate risk.\n2. An insight from the Arbitrum Days workshop at Istanbul was the DAO needs a strategy/program for different verticals - RWAs, gaming, NFTs, De-Fi, DeSo, DeSci, etc. Another way of looking at STEP 1 is that it’s a proposal boosting the stable RWA vertical on Arbitrum, with the added advantage that it’s in the form of an investment rather than a grant.\n\n    More generally, stable RWAs have an attractive risk-reward ratio for Arbitrum in terms of sectors we should be nurturing. The total US treasury market is over $20 trillion, some of which is expected to come onchain to satisfy demand from wealthy investors. As the home of De-Fi, we should not cede space to [Base](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/12/12/coinbase-debuts-rwa-platform-built-on-base-under-abu-dhabi-regulators-oversight/) or [Mantle](https://snapshot.org/#/bitdao.eth/proposal/0x26884fce58b66e82fa74735a2e255f76654618278432897f4ca2430702e95dcd) that have their own RWA support program.\n\n3. Although protocols on Arbitrum and governance might wish to hold stable RWAs, they are limited by having to conduct due diligence on providers they can trust. This proposal creates a qualified screening committee that evaluates applicants and prepares a Assessment Report on them, providing a roster of vetted service providers that anyone can use for investing assets into RWAs\n\nIn conclusion, we expect that lessons learned from implementation of this proposal can pave the way for a new form of an ecosystem support program, where the ArbitrumDAO supports projects not with grants but purchases of financial products built on our chain that also diversify our treasury holdings.\n\n### Timeline and Procedure\n\n1. Snapshot temperature check and [if successful] an on-chain vote via Tally to fully implement this framework in February 2024;\n2. Screening committee publishes RFP with specific information requested from applicants and minimum criteria they must satisfy to be considered;\n3. Receive applications from service providers (30-day submission window);\n4. Screening committee reviews each application, and where needed, conduct additional due diligence and research;\n5. Assessment report on eligible service providers released by screening committee (April);\n6. ARB token holders divide their voting power among approved service providers to allocate sanctioned amount using the [Snapshot Weighted Voting](https://docs.snapshot.org/user-guides/proposals/voting-types) strategy. Providers receive an allocation proportionate to their support from ARB holders, provided they clear a threshold of 10% of all eligible votes.\n\n### Additional Considerations\n\n1. The Arbitrum foundation will act as the legal entity and face the service provider during the KYC process. They shall also hold any tokens/NFTs received in exchange of investments and have authority to withdraw assets from the service provider should any risks be discovered; however an explanation for the same shall be posted on the forum within 3 days of taking such an action. They will also periodically sweep interest earned from these assets to our treasury. Fire Drills will be periodically conducted to test solvency and clear out any AML delays in returning investments\n2. Interest earned from RWAs will be swept to our treasury for increasing our bridged USDC holdings (currently at 10 cents). For reference, $20 million in t-bills currently returns roughly $1 million in annual interest. Delay of more than 60 days in returning interest earned will result in liquidation of an investment from a service provider.\n3. Proposals to utilize interest earned will follow the same process as requesting funds from the treasury\n4. The screening committee will comprise of 6 members: Karpatkey, GFX Labs Steakhouse Financial, Nethermind and North Lake Legal, & the Treasury WG acting as facilitator and tie-breaking vote\n    * Karpatkey is a DeFi-native organisation specialising in professional DAO finance through industry-leading research and tooling since 2020. We’ve been working with GnosisDAO, Balancer, ENS, CoW Protocol, and Lido on financial planning, operations, and strategy, diversifying their treasuries into sustainable portfolios of DeFi investments designed to support DAOs in executing their missions.\n    * GFX Labs is the leading provider of professional governance services in DeFi. We are most known for our extensive past and present contributions at Uniswap, MakerDAO, Compound, and Optimism. GFX focuses on operational improvements and improving organizational quality and structure, with strong relevant experience in real-world asset onboarding and stablecoins.\n    * Steakhouse Financial is the leading CFO-as-a-service consulting company for DAOs. We specialize in stablecoins and RWAs. Our team has been merging TradFi and DeFi for years – our team met as contributors to the Strategic Finance Core Unit at MakerDAO.\n\n        We’ve contributed extensively to asset-liability management research and structuring MakerDAOs RWA portfolio, including its exposure to treasuries. We specialize in deep due-diligence reports of tokenized issuers and publish the leading research report and Dune dashboards covering the space https://dune.com/steakhouse/tokenized-securities\n\n    * *Nethermind* is a blockchain research and software engineering company empowering enterprises and developers worldwide to work with and build upon decentralized systems. Our work touches every part of the Web3 ecosystem, from fundamental cryptography research to security, node infrastructure, DeFi, and application-layer protocol development. We have a team of over 220, with more than 180 engineers on board. Nethermind is a key contributor to the development of Ethereum, with our execution client representing over a quarter of all synced nodes. Additionally, we actively build the Starknet ecosystem and support our institutional and enterprise partners in advanced blockchain, digital assets, and decentralized finance (DeFi) fields.\n    * North Lakes Legal is a law firm at the leading edge of bridging decentralized finance, DAOs and Real World Assets. North Lakes Legal implemented the standards for the initial high-profile real- world asset (“RWA”) financings in the DeFi space. Christian Petersen is the principal of North Lakes Legal and has 26 years of cross border project and structured finance experience. In support of Maker DAO, North Lakes Legal has structured, negotiated, and implemented the following:\n        -  Société Generale – DAI 40 million, tokenized French covered bonds\n        - Huntingdon Valley Bank – DAI 100 million vault to acquire RWA loan participations\n        - BlockTower Credit – DAI 150 million vault utilizing Tinlake for various RWAs\n        - Monetalis Clydesdale – DAI 500 million to acquire U.S. treasury ETF\n        - Most recently, North Lakes Legal advised Ondo Finance in the development, structuring and launch of Ondo USDY.\n\n5. The Assessment Report prepared by the screening committee on eligible service providers will be used to inform delegates and ARB holders in casting their weighted snapshot vote dividing sanctioned ARB among providers. Details in the Assessment Report include schedule for returning interest, relationship with Arbitrum (debtor or custodian), maturation period of asset, legal structure (bankruptcy remote assessment), solvency, Arbitrum alignment, turnaround time for returning investment, transparency level (proof of reserves/read only access to accounts), and fees charged.\n6. 200,000 ARB for implementation of this proposal; unused funds returned to treasury\n\nAnticipated expenditures include\n* 6 month third party audit on selected providers\n* Honorarium of 500 ARB per application for each of the 6 screening committee members (NB: this * may * be supplemented with a small application fee not exceeding $1000 to prevent spam proposals;\n* Engaging external experts and due diligence specialists where relevant.\n* Full account of fund utilization will be posted on the forum. \n\n7. Eligibility: Full RFP will be created by screening committee post Snapshot approval. Some preliminary considerations;\n* Tokenized tbills launched or bridged to Arbitrum are NOT a hard requirement to apply.\n* Attested for verifiability of assets by a 3rd party\n* Strong reputation with relevant team experience, evidence of managing assets, and regulatory compliance\n* Fully liquid, secured, and safe investments that can be called back by the DAO with 3 working days notice\n* Between 0.15-0.4% (15-40 bps) of total amount in fees with no bonuses, \n* Liquid t-bills or money market instruments approximating the so called “risk-free rate of return”",

Historical similar proposals with similar objectives passed and led to positive price and TVL outcomes. The voting timeline metrics and market impact suggest strong consensus for the 'For' option.
