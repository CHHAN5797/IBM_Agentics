There are additional small  treasury management actions included in this proposal for house-keeping.\n\n# Motivation\n\nIn preparation for the upcoming launch of the Merit program and the expected renewal of DAO service providers, this proposal intends to:\n\n* Consolidate the DAOs smaller holdings to GHO\n* Swap larger stablecoins holdings for GHO\n* Replenish the stablecoins Reserves in Aave v3\n* Migrate funds from Aave v2 to v3\n* Bridge funds from Polygon to Mainnet\n\nTo reduce governance burden, this proposal also includes withdrawing BAL and CRV from mainnet Aave v3 and v2, as well as withdrawing and bridging them from Polygon Aave v3 to Ethereum. All the BAL and CRV included in this proposal will then be transferred to the Aave Liquidity Committee (ALC) for its future allocation on behalf of the DAO.\n\nIn addition to the above, this proposal seeks to enable @karpatkey_TokenLogic to submit proposals via the Direct-to-AIP process which include actions similar to the above:\n\n* Consolidate treasury holdings to GHO \n* Migrate funds from v2 to v3 deployments\n* Move funds from Polygon to Ethereum\n\n# Specification\n\nThe table below summarises the tasks to be performed by this proposal:\n\n### Part A\n\nPart A, or the first AIP resulting from this proposal seeks alignment to perform the following actions:\n\n| Withdraw & Swap to GHO | Migrate ETH v2 to v3| Polygon to ETH|\n| ---              | ---          | ---              |\n| aEthLUSD (All-1) | awBTC (All-1)| aPolwETH (All-1) |\n| aEthUSDC (1.25M) | awETH (All-1)| aPolDAI (All-1)  |\n| aEthUSDT (1.5M)  | aUSDC (300k) | aPolBAL (All-1)  |\n| LUSD (All)       |              | aPolCRV (All-1)  |\n| aLUSD (All-1)    |              |                  |\n| aBUSD (50k)      |              |                  |\n| aTUSD (All-1)    |              |                  |\n| aFRAX (All-1)     |              |                  |\n| aUSDT (200k)     |              |                  |\n| aDAI (All-1)     |              |                  |\n| aDPI  (All-1)    |              |                  |\n\nWithdraw aCRV, aEthCRV, aBAL and aEthBAL and transfer BAL and CRV to ALC SAFE.\n\nEnable @karpatkey_Tokenlogic so submit funding proposals consisting of the following via the Direct-to-AIP process:\n\n1) Consolidate the treasury to GHO\n2) Migrate funds from v2 to v3 on respective networks\n3) Move funds from Polygon to Ethereum\n\n### Part B\n\nAs part of the second AIP resulting from this ARFC, the following actions are included:\n\n| Transfer ALC     | Deposit ETH v3  |Swap to GHO|\n| ---              | ---             |---        |\n| BAL              | ETH (All-1)     | aBUSD     |\n| CRV              | DAI (All)       |           |\n\nWithdraw and swap remaining BUSD from Aave v2 (assuming there is enough on-chain liquidity)\n\nALC SAFE:`0x205e795336610f5131Be52F09218AF19f0f3eC60`\n\n# Disclosure\n\nTokenLogic and karpatkey receive no payment for this proposal.

        "body": "---\n\ntitle: [TEMP CHECK] Introducing \"Curator\" by Llama\nauthor: @Llamaxyz - @TokenLogic, @dydymoon and Fermin\ncreated: 2023-07-11\n\n---\n\n# Summary\n\nThis publication introduces the `Curator` by Llama.\n\nThe `Curator` is a dedicated contract for managing the exchange of assets with MEV and price-impact protection, where possible.\n\nThe below provides a high level overview of the functionality provided by the Curator:\n\n* Swap Assets\n* Acquire LSTs\n* Transfer Assets\n\n# Motivation\n\nThe DAO is required to exchange assets. This could be to reduce the DAOs exposure to long tail assets or to increase stable coin holdings to facilitate payment to various service providers. It is not possible to perform swaps directly from the Collector / Treasury Contract. After much discussion, @llamaxyz and @bgdlabs have concluded that it is not viable to upgrade the Collector Contract to facilitate the efficient management of the DAO's assets. As a result, a series of separate contracts are required. \n\nA part of this solution is the `Curator`. The `Curator` receives assets from the Collector / Treasury Contract, swaps (or deposits) assets and sends the newly received asset to another address. The `Curator` is intended for solely exchanging assets and not holding assets. \n\nThe first iteration of the `Curator` is to be deployed on Ethereum and then later introduced to other networks. On Ethereum, the `Curator` is to interact with CoW Swap, Lido Protocol, and Rocket Pool contracts. \n\nTo limit the surface area of the contract, an `AllowList` will define which contracts the `Curator`can be interacted with. The `ShortExecutor` must first add each contract address to the `AllowList`. \n\nIt is possible to assign the `curatorRole()` to a specified wallet address, Treasury Manager. The `curatorRole` can then only interact with contract on the `AllowList` set by governance. The `AllowList` eliminates the risk of the `Curator` interacting with a malicious contract or running away with the DAO's funds. The intent is to implement the highest heirarchy of control.\n\nFor future deployments of the `Curator` on other networks, the aggregator protocol used to swap assets with MEV protection does so over a lengthy time horizon. This prevents any further steps performed by the same AIP submission. In these instances the `curatorRole` offers more flexibility and reduces the AIP overhead.\n\nEach Curator deployment will contain different functionality tailored to that network and Aave DAO's needs. As a result, each deployment will be presented to Aave DAO as an [ARFC] proposal for the community to discuss and vote on. \n\nDuring the intial deployment on Ethereum, @Llamaxyz advocates for using the `ShortExecutor` to perform all the necessary transactions. The `curatorRole` can be assigned at a later date. \n\n# Specification\n\nThe Ethereum Curator will provide the following functionality to Aave Protocol: \n\n1. Receive assets from the Treasury (assets must be pushed)\n2. Redeem aTokens for underlying spanning Aave v1, v2, and v3\n3. Swap assets via CoW Swap with MEV protection and using Milkman\n4. No reentrant \n5. Cancel trade\n6. Rescue tokens\n7. allowTokens(address[] tokens) onlyExecutorOrAllowedCaller\n8. Deposit ETH into Lido Finance Protocol to receive stETH\n9. Wrap stETH to create wstETH\n10. Deposit ETH into Rocket Pool's contract to receive rETH\n11. Transfer assets to Treasury\n12. Call a function to deposit assets in Aave v3 on behalf of Treasury\n13. Allow-list tokens/contracts that can be interacted with\n14. Allow-list Executor and approved multisig, CuratorRole().\n\nThe Curator will contain an `AllowList` defining which contracts the contract can interact with. The `AllowList` can only be updated by Aave Governance via the `ShortExecutor`. \n\n# Next Steps\n\nUpon recieving a favourable Snapshot vote, @llamaxyz will continue finalising the payload in preparation for submitting to @BGDlabs for peer review. An [ARFC] post will be shared and progressed through governance.\n\nThe [ARFC] publication will provide greater insights to the functions on the contract and the Treasury Committee will be a separate [ARFC].\n\n# Disclosure\n\n@llamaxyz is a service provider to Aave DAO. Llama is not presenting this ARFC on behalf of any third party and is compensated by only Aave DAO for creating this ARFC.

        "body": "---\n\ntitle: [ARFC] Aave Funding Update\nauthor: \n@TokenLogic - @MatthewGraham, @scottincrypto \n@r3genFinance - @Elliott_r3gen, @Pepperoni_Jo3_r3gen\ncreated: 2023-10-23\n\n---\n\n# Summary\n\nThis publication proposes updating Aave DAO's stable coin holdings in preparation for the emergence of several service provider proposals. Upon implementation, the DAO will be sufficiently capitalised for the next 6 months.\n\n# Motivation\n\nThe below outlines the current service provider and delegate nominated expenses.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SJC8KSOzT.png)\n\nThe is also a maximum [$1M USD](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cst5Kx0N2t4PfyNAEpobH6dWUE2JKfo49dSjRMhelfY/edit) bounty program with Immunefi to be aware of.\n\nIn the near future, Q4 2023 and Q1 2024, we expect new proposals to emerge in the following areas:\n\n* Security (Certora, Sigma)\n* Risk (Chaos Labs, Gauntlet) \n* Financial Service Providers ([numerous](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-aave-financial-management-working-group/15193))\n* Marketing (Aave Companies)\n* Delegates (6 teams)\n* Liquidity Committee (GLC)\n\nAssuming the DAO continues migrating service providers to GHO and stops using AAVE as a form of payment outside of the SM, the DAO will require additional GHO.\n\nThe GHO Stability Module (GSM) is some weeks away from being production ready and this proposal intends to sufficiently capitalise the DAO in preparation for receiving several service provider proposals in the areas mentioned above.\n\nThe previous [GHO Funding Proposal](https://app-aave-com.ipns.dweb.link/governance/proposal/?proposalId=347) is sufficient to cover the following:\n\n* $375k ACI (6 months)\n* $180k Delegate Funding (6 months)\n* $616k Aave Grants DAO (6 months)\n* $550k Aave Companies (3 months)\n\nTotal: $1,721k GHO\n\nThe DAO holds [1,226,040.11 GHO](https://etherscan.io/token/0x40D16FC0246aD3160Ccc09B8D0D3A2cD28aE6C2f?a=0x464c71f6c2f760dda6093dcb91c24c39e5d6e18c) with the [TUSD and BUSD](http://app-aave-com.ipns.localhost:48084/governance/proposal/347/) assets still to be swapped ot GHO. When these swaps have been executed, there is enough GHO to cover the above expenses but not sufficient to onboard future service providers.\n\nThis proposal intends to ensure the DAO is well capitalised. A separate DAO budget publication will be shared during Q4 2023.\n\nThe DAO has sufficient USDC, DAI and USDT deposited across the various instances of Aave Protocol to support existing streams and the [AURA purchase](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-enhancing-aave-daos-liquidity-incentive-strategy-on-balancer/15061).\n\nHowever, with the emergence of new service provider proposal expected, the DAO needs to adjust its stable coin holdings. Ths publication supports transferring additional funds from Polygon to Mainnet and acquiring GHO on the market to ensure the DAO  is well capitalised for the next 6 months.\n\n## Security Service Providers\n\nAave DAO's 2H 2023 Security budget consisted of the last 3 months of Certora's 10 month stream, the last month of Sigma's 12 month stream and the adhoc Sigma funding proposal for the audit of Governance v3, a.DI and GSM.\n\n* [Certora](https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/114/) 10 months Nov 22 to Sep 23 ($2,700,000 USD equivalent)\n* [Sigma](https://app-aave-com.ipns.dweb.link/governance/proposal/88/) 12 months Jul 22 to Jul 23 ($1,296,000 USD)\n* [Sigma](https://app-aave-com.ipns.dweb.link/governance/proposal/313/) Gov v3, a.DI and GSM during Q3 to Q4 2023 ($162k)\n\nThis proposal assumes the DAO will receive a 12 month proposal from Certora and will continue to use Sigma on an adhoc basis. \n\nFor the next 6 months, we propose having $1.5M of funds available for Security service providers. We expect this budget to not include AAVE, and to include DAI and GHO.\n\n## Bug Bounty Program\n\nThe Aave DAO has a [$1M USD](http://app-aave-com.ipns.localhost:48084/governance/proposal/325) bug bounty program with Immunefi. It is important the DAO has sufficient funds available, if ever they are needed.\n\n## Risk Service Providers\n\nDuring 2023, the Risk Service provider budget was $3.5M nominated in AAVE, aUSDC and aEthUSDT. Going forward we expect this to be nominated in aUSDT and GHO, provided the community aligns with this approach. The most recent Chaos Labs proposal was nominated solely in aEthUSDT and we have received feedback future proposals are to exclude AAVE.\n\nBased upon our discussions, we anticipate the overall risk budget for the next 12 months being approximately $2.5M assuming both service providers are retained by the DAO.\n\n## Voting Service Providers\n\nThe current Orbit program has 6 participating delegates. This proposal makes allowance for 6 delegates to continue receiving funding. At $5k per month, this is 360k of GHO per year.\n\nWe note, @EzR3aL is expected to emerge as a paid delegate and at least one delegate will progress to being a service provider. It is very possible the number of paid delegates decreases over time and if so, the GHO can be reassigned.\n\n## Financial Service Providers\n\nA budget of $400k is proposed for the next 6 months. This is $50k more than the TokenLogic funding proposal and should be sufficient to encourage other bids to emerge. \n\n** Disclosure: TokenLogic intends to pursue becoming a service provider in this area. Our previous proposal was $350k spanning 6 months.**\n\n## Marketing Service Provider\n\nCurrently performed by @AaveCompanies at the rate of 550k per 3 months. The previous 6 month grant period spend approximate [950k USD](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-updated-aave-grants-continuation-proposal/14951) on events and marketing. The Aave brand and swag is renowned across the industry. There are no proposed changes to the average 500k USD per quarter spend rate.\n\n## GHO Liquidity Committee\n\nThe GLC is expected to continue beyond the initial 3 months duration. For the purpose of this publication, it is assumed the GLC will require similar funding during the next 3 month funding cycle.\n\n$450k in GHO has been allocated to this initiative which is $50k more than the current funding rate. \n\n## Growth Service Provider\n\nThe ACI team with $375k GHO. Supported by existing GHO holdings.\n\n## Development Service Provider\n\nThe @bgdlabs team with <2k AAVE and <630k aEthDAI remaining on the current 6 month stream. Supported by existing DAI on Aave v3 Ethereum holdings.\n\n## Aave Grants DAO Service Provider\n\nThe AGD team is currently funded with the 616k GHO, 612k aUSDT and $400k in ARB for the next 6 months. Supported by existing GHO and aUSDT (v2) holdings.\n\n## Safety Module\n\nExpenses relating to the Safety Module (SM) have been omitted. Currently, the SM is funded with AAVE emissions. If the DAO was to upgrade the SM in the near future, it is unclear if that will happen within the next 6 months. As a result, any bribe / quest funding request will be managed separately.\n\n## Funding\n\nOver the next 6 months, the DAO should be sufficiently well capitalised to accommodate the emergence of the following expenses:\n\n* $1.5M - Security (6 months)\n* $1.25M - Risk (6 months)\n* $1.0M - Bug Bounty (unknown)\n* $0.5M - Marketing (3 months)\n* $0.4M - Financial Services (6 months)\n* $0.45M - GHO Liquidity Committee (3 months)\n\nTotal: 5.1M USD\n\nAll Financial Services, Marketing and Liquidity Committee expenses are to be nominated in GHO. \n\nRisk and Security allocation can be nominated in any of the following aEthDAI or aETHUSDT or GHO. A separate proposal can adjust the asset composition if any amendments are required. Alternatively, the future GLC proposal can swap assets to GHO upon being renewed.\n\nThere is 1.5M of DAI already being transferred from [PR339 - Polygon to Ethereum](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-proposals/pull/339). 1M of this can be deposited into Aave v3, the aDAI on Aave v2 can be redeemed and deposited into v3 and net BGD stream allocation is 1.34M aEthDAI. An additional 0.5M can be transferred from Polygon to Ethereum increasing the overal aEthDAI holding to 1.84M aEthDAI for future expenses.\n\nThe ACI aUSDT stream is now complete and only the AGD allowance, 613k, remains. Therefore, of the1.03M of aUSDT in Aave v2, leaving 0.7M for AGD to draw down 0.613M from, 0.33M (at time of writing) can be migrated to Aave v3. There is 0.4M aEthUSDT in Aave v3 with 0.23M aEthUSDT allocated to Chaos Labs. Net transfer of aUSDT and unallocated aEthUSDT is 0.50M aEthUSDT. Transfer 0.75M of USDT from Polygon to Ethereum increases the available USDT on Ethereum to 1.25M aEthUSDT.\n\nAn additional 1.0M USDC from Polygon is to be transferred to Ethereum to ensure the Immunefi bug bounty program has sufficient funds available if required.\n\nAdditional funds will be required to cover the full amount of expenses mentioned above. This proposal will start moving Aave in the right direction.\n\n# Specification\n\nThis proposal will perform the following tasks on Ethereum:\n\n* Deposit 1M units of DAI from Treasury into Aave v3, aEthDAI\n* Migrate all but 0.7M aUSDT from Aave v2 to v3, aEthUSDT (0.33M units at time of writing)\n* Migrate all aDAI from Aave v2 to v3, aEthDAI (470k units at time of writing)\n\nSwap the following asset holdings to GHO:\n\n* All Aave ARC aUSDC (56,843.44 units at time of writing)\n* All GUSD (18,464.03 units at time of writing)\n* All available aTUSD that can be redeemed (57,373.85 units at time of writing)\n* All UST (893,257.63 units at time of writing)\n* 500k units of DAI held in Treasury (on route from Polygon)\n\nBridge the following assets from Polygon to Ethereum:\n\n* Redeem and transfer 1.7M USDC to Ethereum Treasury\n* Redeem and transfer 0.5M DAI to Ethereum Treasury\n* Redeem and transfer 0.75M USDT to Ethereum Treasury\n\nThe USDC bridged from Polygon can neither be swapped nor deposited into Aave v3 in a single AIP submission. A second AIP will perform the following:\n\n* Deposit 0.5M DAI into Aave v3\n* Deposit 0.75M USDT into Aave v3\n* Deposit 1.0M USDC into Aave v3\n* Swap 700k USDC to GHO\n\nUpon implementing the second AIP, the following funds will be available to support new expenses:\n\n* More than 1.25M of aEthUSDT (Migration v2 to v3, Polygon Transfer, Net Chaos Labs stream)\n* More than 1.8M of aEthDAI (Migration v2 to v3, Deposit, Polygon Transfer, Net BGD Stream)\n* More than 1.5M of GHO (Swap assets to GHO, net current known expenses)\n* More than 1.0M of aEthUSDC (Polygon Transfer)\n\nThe above takes into consideration current streaming contract obligations and proposals already advancing through governance. \n\n# Next Steps\n\n1) If consensus on ARFC stage is reached, escalate to ARFC snapshot stage.\n2) If ARFC snapshot stage outcome is YAE, escalate to AIP stage.\n\nWhilst we advocate for having 12 months on runway readily available in the right asset configuration. The priority is to ensure the DAO is sufficiently capitalised for the next 6 months.\n\nAs mentioned within the proposal, during Q4 2023, a publication relating to the DAOs overal budget allocation will be shared.\n\n# Disclosure\n\nTokenLogic receives no compensation beyond Aave protocol for the creation of this proposal. TokenLogic is a delegate within the Aave ecosystem.\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

This publication proposes sending the AURA to the [Strategic Asset Manager](https://etherscan.io/address/0x6235d8071dbee0a20e7d6ebb214f65d913c7ac1b#code) (SAM) contract. From here, the full amount of AURA should be locked using [Function 9](https://etherscan.io/address/0x6235d8071dbee0a20e7d6ebb214f65d913c7ac1b#writeProxyContract) for vlAURA. The voting rights are to be delegated to the [GLC](https://app.safe.global/balances?safe=eth:0x205e795336610f5131Be52F09218AF19f0f3eC60) using [Function 5](https://etherscan.io/address/0x6235d8071dbee0a20e7d6ebb214f65d913c7ac1b#writeProxyContract).\n\nThe Guardian role on the SAM contract is already configured to the GLC SAFE address. This can be verified using the Read as Proxy [Function 10](https://etherscan.io/address/0x6235d8071dbee0a20e7d6ebb214f65d913c7ac1b#readProxyContract). The Aave v3 Protocol [shortExecutor](https://etherscan.io/address/0xEE56e2B3D491590B5b31738cC34d5232F378a8D5#internaltx) is set up as the Owner of the SAM contract, as seen via [Function 12](https://etherscan.io/address/0x6235d8071dbee0a20e7d6ebb214f65d913c7ac1b#readProxyContract). This means the DAO's on-chain governance process can interact with the SAM and, more importantly, retrieve the DAO's funds if anything were to happen to the GLC.\n\nOnly the Owner can transfer funds from the SAM, meaning the Guardian (multisig) cannot transfer funds, and the funds can only be transferred to the Treasury, which is [hardcoded](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-proposals/pull/208/files#diff-5ee0295025c5828238f7b67392b7e4868cfa5d3e4c11fcb5170cf1abddaa74d7R39) into the contract. This means the auraBAL yield ([2.38%](https://app.aura.finance/#/1/lock)) from vlAURA must be transferred to the Treasury before being transferred to another address where it can be managed.\n\nThe one missing piece of functionality in the SAM is the ability to sell the vlAURA voting rights by participating in [Quests](https://quest.paladin.vote/#/bal) on Paladin. This functionality will only take a few days to create before being sent to @bgdlabs for review as part of the normal payload review process.\n\nWith the AURA locked in the SAM contract, the GLC is then responsible for managing the DAO's holdings in the best interest of the DAO/GHO. This entails voting on Aura Finance gauges, governance votes in Aave DAO's best interest, and selling vlAURA votes via Paladin when it makes sense to do so.\n\n# Specification\n\nThe below details the key steps to be implemented:\n\n* Strategic Assets Manager upgraded to support selling vlAURA voting rights on Paladin\n* AURA is transferred to the Strategic Assets Manager contract\n* AURA is locked for vlAURA\n* Voting rights of vlAURA are to be delegated to the GLC\n* GLC is to manage the vlAURA holding\n\n# Next Steps\n\n1) Gather community feedback on this ARFC.\n2) In 5 days scalate this proposal to the Snapshot ARFC stage.\n3) If the snapshot outcome is YAE, escalate the proposal to AIP stage.\n\n# Disclaimer\n\nTokenLogic receives no compensation beyond Aave protocol for the creation of this proposal. TokenLogic is a delegate within the Aave ecosystem.\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",
