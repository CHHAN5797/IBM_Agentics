        "body": "## Summary\n\nA proposal to adjust ten (10) total risk parameters, including Loan-to-Value and Liquidation Threshold, across five (5) Aave V3 assets.\n\n- GNO on Gnosis\n- OP on Optimism\n- ARB on Arbitrum\n- stMATIC on Polygon\n- MaticX on Polygon\n\n## Analysis\n\nIncreasing the liquidation threshold and LTV for assets allows Aave to enhance users’ capital efficiency. However, this must be balanced with proper risk management to ensure that there is a sufficient buffer in the event of large drawdowns and/or liquidations. The analyses below were conducted utilizing our LT simulations, which showed either minimal or no increases in VaR at the recommended LT levels, while also considering user distribution and on-chain liquidity.\n\n### GNO (Gnosis)\n\nGNO is in isolation mode with a debt ceiling of $2M, with $971K borrowed against it, split between USDC and WXDAI. The top suppliers of GNO have strong health scores of over 3, while some do not borrow against GNO.\n\nGiven the user distribution and liquidity, we recommend increasing the LT to 53% and the LTV to 48%.\n\n### OP (Optimism)\n\nUSDC and USDT are the most popular assets borrowed against OP collateral, together with DAI representing 71% of the total debt against OP. These positions are thus at risk of liquidation should OP’s price fall. \n\nHowever, the largest suppliers maintain relatively strong health scores and on-chain liquidity would support their liquidation.\n\nGiven these factors, we recommend increasing the LTV to 58% and the LT to 63%.\n\n### ARB (Arbitrum)\n\nThere is currently $5.64M borrowed against $28.5M ARB in this market, the majority of which is stablecoins.\n\nCollateral at risk increases smoothly as ARB’s price declines, and we find that on-chain liquidity can support efficient liquidations. \n\nGiven this, we recommend increasing the LTV to 58% and the LT to 63%.\n\n### stMATIC (Polygon)\n\nThere is $6.28M borrowed against $30.09M stMATIC in this market, with $2.4M of that borrowed in E-Mode. Non-E-Mode borrows are primarily of USDC.e.\n\nThe top suppliers maintain relatively strong health scores, with the largest borrowing just $82K against $12M stMATIC, putting this market at relatively lower risk of large scale liquidations.\n\nGiven these factors, we recommend increasing the LTV to 48% and the LT to 58%.\n\n### MaticX (Polygon)\n\n75% of the value borrowed against MaticX is associated with MATIC-correlated assets in E-Mode, putting these positions at a relatively lower risk of liquidation. Non-E-Mode borrows are primarily of stablecoins, with USCD.e the largest.\n\nThe largest MaticX suppliers are either looping with WMATIC, borrowing a small amount of WETH, or borrowing USDC.e. \n\nGiven on-chain liquidity and user distribution, we recommend increasing the LTV to 50% and the LT to 60%.\n\n## Specification\n\nGiven these observations, we recommend making the following changes:\n\n| Chain | Asset | Current LTV | Rec. LTV | Current LT | Rec. LT |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Gnosis | GNO | 45% | 48% | 50% | 53% |\n| Optimism | OP | 50% | 58% | 60% | 63% |\n| Arbitrum | ARB | 50% | 58% | 60% | 63% |\n| Polygon | stMATIC | 45% | 48% | 56% | 58% |\n| Polygon | MaticX | 45% | 50% | 58% | 60% |\n\n## Next Steps\n\nWe invite a community discussion around the proposed parameter updates and, barring community objection, will follow up with a Snapshot vote in five days.\n\n## **Disclaimer**\n\nChaos Labs has not been compensated by any third party for publishing this ARFC.\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain)",

While this concentration does not affect the current recommendation, it is something to continue monitoring and will be considered in future MKR recommendations and in cases of significant market changes.\n\n### V2 → V3 Migration\n\nThere are still nearly 3,400 MKR supplied on V2 Ethereum, with nearly $750K in stablecoins borrowed against MKR collateral. The current supply caps and proposed debt ceiling should allow for the migration of these positions.  \n\n### Positions Analysis\n\nThere are currently two major users utilizing MKR as collateral on V3 Ethereum:\n\n1.

At this time, the total circulating supply on Avalanche is 1,731 WBTC.e. A  considerable portion, nearly 67%, of the circulating supply is concentrated on Aave Avalanche V2 and V3, with ~496 and ~664 tokens, respectively. \n\nGiven the persistence of this trend, we suggest reducing exposure on Aave and proactively modifying risk parameters for the asset. This strategy aims to:\n\n1.  Avert a potential scenario where there is inadequate liquidity to facilitate liquidations in Aave deployments.\n2. Motivate new and existing users on Aave to transition to BTC.b, which has a stronger liquidity profile on Avalanche.\n\n### Limit New Supply\n\nFreeze the WBTC.e reserves on V2 and V3 Avalanche.\n\n### Reduce Capital Efficiency\n\nAdditionally, as a precautionary measure and to further reduce exposure to the asset, we recommend reducing LTs and LTV, without impacting current holders:\n\n- V3 - reduce LT to 70 % and LTV to 0.\n- V2 - reduce LT to 70% and LTV to 0.\n  - at this time, this will lead to 6 accounts totaling $15 to be liquidated.\n\n# Specification\n\n### V3 Avalanche\n\n| Asset | Parameter | Current  | Recommendations |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| WBTC.e | Liquidation Threshold | 75% | 70% |\n| WBTC.e | LTV | 70% | 0% |\n| WBTC.e | Freeze Reserve | NO | YES |\n\n### V2 Avalanche\n\n| Asset | Parameter | Current  | Recommendations |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| WBTC.e | Liquidation Threshold | 75% | 70% |\n| WBTC.e | LTV | 60% | 0% |\n| WBTC.e | Freeze Reserve | NO | YES |\n\n# Next Steps\n\n1. Following community feedback, submit the ARFC for a snapshot vote for final approval.\n2. If consensus is reached, submit an Aave Improvement Proposal (AIP) to implement the proposed updates.\n\n# Disclaimer\n\nChaos Labs has not been compensated by any third party for publishing this ARFC.\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain)",

        "body": "## Summary\n\nA proposal to increase OP’s liquidation threshold and LTV on Aave V3 Optimism.\n\n## Motivation\n\nOP is currently configured with a liquidation threshold (LT) of 40% and max loan-to-value (LTV) of 30%. These parameters were intentionally [set](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-add-op-as-collateral-to-aave-v3/9087/18) conservatively and in isolation mode, when the asset was first listed to ensure mechanisms were working as intended. In [October 2023](https://governance-v2.aave.com/governance/proposal/337/), OP was removed from isolation mode. Following our observations, we believe it prudent to increase the LT and LTV for OP.\n\nOP's average market cap over the past 180 days is $1.78BN, and its daily average volume is $192M.\n\nIt has registered a daily annualized volatility of 98.53%, a 30-day annualized volatility of 92.6%, and its largest single-day price drop was 17.7%.\n\n3.7M of the 7.4M OP supplied is supplied by a single [user](https://community.chaoslabs.xyz/aave/risk/wallets/0x790c9422839fd93a3a4e31e531f96cc87f397c00), who also maintains large positions on Arbitrum and Ethereum. Their last deposit on Optimism was 252K OP on March 12; they repaid $1M USDT on April 6 and currently hold a health score of 2.02.\n\nThe majority of assets borrowed against OP collateral are stablecoins. That puts these positions at risk of liquidation in the event OP’s price moves falls.\nHowever, collateral at risk does not exceed $100K until OP’s price falls to $2.13, a 35% drop from current levels.\n\nGiven these observations, we recommend first aligning OP’s parameters with ARB’s on Arbitrum (50% LTV and 60% LT), an asset with a similar supply distribution and liquidity profile. Following observations at these levels and utilizing our simulation platform, these parameters may be further optimized.\n\n## Specification\n\n| Chain | Asset | Current LTV | Recommended LTV | Current LT | Recommended LT |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Optimism | OP | 30.00% | 50.00% | 40.00% | 60.00% |\n\n# Next Steps\n\nWe invite a community discussion around the proposed parameter updates and, barring community objection, will follow up with a Snapshot vote in five days.\n\n# Disclaimer\n\nChaos Labs has not been compensated by any third party for publishing this ARFC.\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain)",
