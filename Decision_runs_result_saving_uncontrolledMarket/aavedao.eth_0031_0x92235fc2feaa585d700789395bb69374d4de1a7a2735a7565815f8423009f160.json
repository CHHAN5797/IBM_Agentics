        "body": "## Overview\n\nThis proposal continues on the proposed steps from [this post](https://governance.aave.com/t/susd-depeg-update-05-16-2024/17719) by recommending the removal of sUSD as collateral on Aave V3’s Optimism. Additionally, we recommend reducing the LT and LTV of the Stablecoin E-Mode on Optimism, which sUSD is part of, and setting sUSD LTV to 0.\n\n## Motivation\n\nThis recommendation follows the recent proposal to reduce the supply and borrow cap of sUSD to 10m and 1, respectively; that recommendation follows a period of reduced sUSD DEX liquidity, which dropped to a buy-side low of $2M before recovering after the introduction of token incentives.\n\n![image - 2025-01-30T151805.225.png](ipfs://bafkreihgsfq3rklem3uewkfzhpofau2fc7mkp742shace72sae7aay3d7i)\nDuring this period, shorting activity on sUSD was observed between January 9th and January 15th. Following the implementation of token incentives on January 16th, as detailed in [this announcement](https://x.com/synthetix_io/status/1878944713446924552), these short positions were closed, and new borrowing demand primarily came from users farming the newly introduced incentives.\n\nBelow, we present a table of the current sUSD borrows on Aave and the associated strategy exposure. The distribution of such strategies seems to be quite dispersed, with the recent incentive structure leading to demand to create perpetual positions on Synthetix coupled with liquidity pool growth rather than short positions.\n\n| User | Action | Size | Date |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 0xD8b88C185e06eBF8C58B7dc8b7AFf18304CdD888 | Short | 350k | Jan 9 to Jan 15 |\n| 0x49bf093277bf4dde49c48c6aa55a3bda3eedef68 | LP | 150k | 16th |\n| 0x407cff84eeaacda390fe302c99fa5dd32521bc53 | Holding | 400k | 16th |\n| 0xe31deacee1770dfa56f8849724bcb7f8e5f76ef2 | LP | 130k | 16th |\n| 0xf7ca1f0ff0995c84fef530f7c74c69fb80331e81 | Perp | 200k | 16th |\n| 0x9644a6920bd0a1923c2c6c1dddf691b7a42e8a65 | Perp+LP | 750k | 16th |\n| 0xfd81b27d9796a1ba7d7171ea70010c9befb2a62a | Perp | 380k | 17th |\n\n### Peg Dynamics and Mechanism Design\n\nAn analysis of the peg and utilization dynamics revealed that the deviation can be attributed to a combination of multiple factors, including traders profiting from the Synthetix Perpetual platform, the lack of interest rate on sUSD debt in an environment of heightened rates, and the ongoing migration to Synthetix V3 which reduces the demand for sUSD. This created an imbalance as this excess supply was not met with proportional demand, putting downward pressure on the price of sUSD. This conclusion is supported by the increase in sUSD’s market cap, which closely followed the downward price deviation and the growth in interest rates.\n\n![image - 2025-01-30T151807.732.png](ipfs://bafybeicynmyw2iywjymc2s6lbeyjbavpcvsdwnqpwxoz2fnd3av36u3kkm)\nWhile this behavior does not pose a risk to sUSD’s fundamental backing, the exit of sUSD’s price from its concentrated liquidity range reduced buy-side liquidity, thereby increasing Aave's risk to sUSD positions. This liquidity constraint underpinned the recommendation to reduce caps, aiming to mitigate Aave's risk.\n\n### Removing sUSD as Collateral\n\nWith the recent deterrence of the creation of new sUSD debt on Aave and continued minimized supply exposure, the majority of outstanding debt is fundamentally leveraged to explicitly contribute to the recent sUSD incentive programs by minimizing effective peg exposure. However, while highly overcollateralized, the current economics associated with the soft peg mechanism is fundamentally shaky; minimizing the usage of sUSD as collateral is recommended to be performed as a preventive measure. The current distribution of such sUSD-collateralized stablecoin debt positions is highly conservative, as can be seen below, thereby requiring a significant depeg to start to contribute negatively to the Aave protocol, and the expectation is such that exposure will continue to be minimized over time, as has been the case with a 3M reduction in supply on Aave (25%) over the last 7 days.\n\n![image - 2025-01-30T151810.268.png](ipfs://bafkreichtqxkc33sgfqdmovkfkb52lal52eksh3ynamdjoghnkt333o3fe)\n![image - 2025-01-30T151812.842.png](ipfs://bafkreifmjwarbys4s3iecgetat2nmeyxp22qa4r7jyjbsru2qlrrpapvdy)\nMoreover, during a swift depeg event 7 months ago, we proposed an immediate LTV0 change due to the deprecation of their spot synths contributing to significant downward pressure, as can be seen [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/susd-depeg-update-05-16-2024/17719). The fundamental characteristics of the asset eventually improved once more through mechanical changes on Synthetix’s side in the redemption process, leading to the unfreezing of the asset, as seen in [this](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-chaos-labs-parameter-recommendations-susd-on-v3-optimism-05-23-2024/17779) post. However, we continued to reduce exposure in the form of decreasing caps significantly coupled with decreasing LTV/LTs in both the general market and E-Mode configuration, leading to a more conservative state. As such, a significant buffer of 6% price movement already exists between the collateral value at the LT and the bad debt threshold of 1/(1+LB) in e-mode itself.\n\n## Recommendation\n\nTo further improve this safety buffer and given the conservative distribution of collateralized debt positions throughout the stablecoin E-Mode config on Optimism, we recommend decreasing the LTV/LT in Stablecoins E-Mode while minimizing induced liquidations.\n\nConsidering the current positioning within the E-Mode, we estimate the optimal LT reduction to be 87%. While we intend to deprecate the E-Mode and remove sUSD from it progressively, this change poses an initial step in that direction. Chaos Labs will monitor the market and introduce additional Liquid E-Modes if demand for a stablecoin-correlated E-Mode remains.\n\nThe change to 87% LT is expected to cause the liquidation of just $95K of collateral.\n\n![image - 2025-01-30T151815.223.png](ipfs://bafkreihlu36ppeeaml3zkpfe7vuf2iqfakfent4yzb2n3i3xqnpw7ixwpm)\nThe liquidations caused at the recommended LT are primarily stablecoins with significant liquidity to support the minimal liquidation size, with sUSD liquidations only representing $2.4K, or 3.2%.\n\n![image - 2025-01-30T151817.770.png](ipfs://bafkreieomtso2cfoswuhmg6ehmc4sdsxd3wrrdtgicbzd57u44tgetqlmu)\nAdditionally, we recommend setting the LTV of sUSD outside of the Stablecoin Correlated E-Mode to 0; this measure will prevent additional borrowing from being performed using sUSD as collateral, hence limiting the future risk posed by an sUSD downward deviation. \n\nThis measure will simultaneously apply to both sUSD parameters within and outside of the E-Mode, hence limiting the opening of new positions.\n\nFollowing an improvement of the sUSD peg and a reduction in sUSD-denominated collateral, Chaos Labs will reinstate the borrow cap to a defined value determined by our methodology.\n\n## Specification\n\nFor the sUSD asset on Aave V3 Optimism instance, we recommend the following:\n\n| Asset | Deployment | Current LTV | Rec. LTV |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| sUSD | Optimism | 60.00% | 0.00% |\n\nFor the Stablecoin E-Mode on Aave V3 Optimism instance, we recommend the following:\n\n| Parameter | Current Value | Rec. Value |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| LTV | 90.00% | 0.00% |\n| LT | 93.00% | 87.00% |\n| Liquidation Penalty | 1.00% | 1.00% |\n\n# **Disclaimer**\n\nChaos Labs has not been compensated by any third party for publishing this ARFC.\n\n# **Copyright**\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain)",

        "body": "# Summary\n\nA proposal to reduce LT and LTV for USDC on Aave V2\n\n# Motivation\n\nFollowing our [ongoing reduction](https://governance.aave.com/t/generalized-lt-ltv-reduction-on-aave/16766) of stablecoin LTs and LTVs on Aave V3 markets, we propose reducing LTs and LTVs on V2 to limit risks posed by the current parameters and align them closer to V3’s parameters. \n\nIt is important to note that in some cases, it is difficult to reduce LTs because of users looping assets with themselves. For example, on Ethereum, there are 58 wallets that are both supplying and borrowing more than 10,000 USDC. This leads us to recommend two different options on which the community can decide: a more aggressive LT reduction, which will result in more liquidations but help reduce LT more quickly and a conservative LT reduction, which will prioritize limiting liquidations. For all options, we recommend decreasing LTV to the target of 75%. \n\n## LT/LTV Reduction\n\nThe overall goal of our stablecoin LT/LTV reduction is the same as on V3, ultimately achieving the following parameters:\n\n| Final LTV | Final LT |\n| --- | --- |\n| 75.00% | 78.00% |\n\n***USDC (Ethereum)***\n\nCurrently, reducing LT would require inducing a significant number of liquidations; a reduction of just 0.50% would create $137K in new liquidations, and a 2% reduction would create $200K in new liquidations. This is largely caused by two users ([1](https://community.chaoslabs.xyz/aave-v2/risk/wallets/0xb60bda0bab52839a3334bd849d2afb2aa566e631), [2](https://community.chaoslabs.xyz/aave-v2/risk/wallets/0xf451d30a7ac2e56f52a36825b155b0ac1fb7a867)), both of whom are looping USDC with itself. Thus, our conservative proposal is not adjusting LT, while the aggressive calls for reducing it by 0.50%.\n| Asset | Value Liquidated ($) | Accounts Liquidated |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Conservative | - | - |\n| Aggressive | 137.3K | 10 |\n\n***USDC.e (Polygon)***\n\nSimilar to USDC on Ethereum, it is difficult to reduce the LT without inducing large liquidations, thus the conservative proposal calls for a reduction to 84.50%.\n\nThe three largest potential liquidations ([1](https://community.chaoslabs.xyz/aave-v2/risk/wallets/0xb3095b2861fba8ebcfd199546ce9488c75676850),[2](https://community.chaoslabs.xyz/aave-v2/risk/wallets/0x299b189f47838ee8ebb630c3024bb1cd9f109ee8),[3](https://community.chaoslabs.xyz/aave-v2/risk/wallets/0x818b84cc4c3012cb6b36bfb627fd82438718fc7c)), representing the majority of new value eligible for liquidation, are all wallets that are looping USDC.e with itself.\n\nThe more aggressive approach would reduce LT to 83% and potentially induce $103K worth of liquidations.\n\n| Asset | Value Liquidated ($) | Accounts Liquidated |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Conservative | 10K | 45 |\n| Aggressive | 103K | 235 |\n\n\n***USDC.e (Avalanche)***\n\nOur approach involves reducing USDC.e’s LT to 78%, inducing $10,300 worth of liquidations across 11 new wallets.\n\nAgain, the largest liquidation would be a [user](https://community.chaoslabs.xyz/aave-v2/risk/wallets/0xdb815d4071c3d8b2ebec6c003f30bfbfa6a5d8b8) who is looping USDC.e. This would bring the market in line with our final parameters, and thus there is no need for an aggressive proposal.\n\n# Specification\n\n| Chain | Asset | Current LTV | Rec. LTV | Current LT | Rec LT (Moderate/Aggressive) | \n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | \n| Ethereum | USDC | 80.00% | 75.00% | 87.50% | No Change / 87.00% | \n| Polygon | USDC.e | 80.00% | 75.00% | 85.00% | 84.50% / 83.00% | \n| Avalanche | USDC.e | 75.00% | No Change | 80.00% | 78.00% | \n\n\n# Next Steps\n\n1. Following community feedback, submit the ARFC for a snapshot vote for final approval.\n2. If consensus is reached, submit an Aave Improvement Proposal (AIP) to implement the proposed updates.\n\n# Disclaimer\n\nChaos Labs has not been compensated by any third party for publishing this ARFC.\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain)",

        "body": "## Summary\n\nA proposal to adjust ten (10) total risk parameters, including Loan-to-Value and Liquidation Threshold, across five (5) Aave V3 assets.\n\n- GNO on Gnosis\n- OP on Optimism\n- ARB on Arbitrum\n- stMATIC on Polygon\n- MaticX on Polygon\n\n## Analysis\n\nIncreasing the liquidation threshold and LTV for assets allows Aave to enhance users’ capital efficiency. However, this must be balanced with proper risk management to ensure that there is a sufficient buffer in the event of large drawdowns and/or liquidations. The analyses below were conducted utilizing our LT simulations, which showed either minimal or no increases in VaR at the recommended LT levels, while also considering user distribution and on-chain liquidity.\n\n### GNO (Gnosis)\n\nGNO is in isolation mode with a debt ceiling of $2M, with $971K borrowed against it, split between USDC and WXDAI. The top suppliers of GNO have strong health scores of over 3, while some do not borrow against GNO.\n\nGiven the user distribution and liquidity, we recommend increasing the LT to 53% and the LTV to 48%.\n\n### OP (Optimism)\n\nUSDC and USDT are the most popular assets borrowed against OP collateral, together with DAI representing 71% of the total debt against OP. These positions are thus at risk of liquidation should OP’s price fall. \n\nHowever, the largest suppliers maintain relatively strong health scores and on-chain liquidity would support their liquidation.\n\nGiven these factors, we recommend increasing the LTV to 58% and the LT to 63%.\n\n### ARB (Arbitrum)\n\nThere is currently $5.64M borrowed against $28.5M ARB in this market, the majority of which is stablecoins.\n\nCollateral at risk increases smoothly as ARB’s price declines, and we find that on-chain liquidity can support efficient liquidations. \n\nGiven this, we recommend increasing the LTV to 58% and the LT to 63%.\n\n### stMATIC (Polygon)\n\nThere is $6.28M borrowed against $30.09M stMATIC in this market, with $2.4M of that borrowed in E-Mode. Non-E-Mode borrows are primarily of USDC.e.\n\nThe top suppliers maintain relatively strong health scores, with the largest borrowing just $82K against $12M stMATIC, putting this market at relatively lower risk of large scale liquidations.\n\nGiven these factors, we recommend increasing the LTV to 48% and the LT to 58%.\n\n### MaticX (Polygon)\n\n75% of the value borrowed against MaticX is associated with MATIC-correlated assets in E-Mode, putting these positions at a relatively lower risk of liquidation. Non-E-Mode borrows are primarily of stablecoins, with USCD.e the largest.\n\nThe largest MaticX suppliers are either looping with WMATIC, borrowing a small amount of WETH, or borrowing USDC.e. \n\nGiven on-chain liquidity and user distribution, we recommend increasing the LTV to 50% and the LT to 60%.\n\n## Specification\n\nGiven these observations, we recommend making the following changes:\n\n| Chain | Asset | Current LTV | Rec. LTV | Current LT | Rec. LT |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Gnosis | GNO | 45% | 48% | 50% | 53% |\n| Optimism | OP | 50% | 58% | 60% | 63% |\n| Arbitrum | ARB | 50% | 58% | 60% | 63% |\n| Polygon | stMATIC | 45% | 48% | 56% | 58% |\n| Polygon | MaticX | 45% | 50% | 58% | 60% |\n\n## Next Steps\n\nWe invite a community discussion around the proposed parameter updates and, barring community objection, will follow up with a Snapshot vote in five days.\n\n## **Disclaimer**\n\nChaos Labs has not been compensated by any third party for publishing this ARFC.\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain)",

        "body": "# Summary\n\nFollowing sUSD’s depeg, after which [the market was frozen on V3 Optimism](https://governance.aave.com/t/susd-depeg-update-05-16-2024/17719/13), we provide an update and recommend future actions.\n\n# Motivation\n\nsUSD depegged on May 16, 2024, with its price reaching a low of 0.915 relative to USDC. As it was depegging, we provided a full analysis of the cause and a recommendation to freeze its Optimism market; sUSD has since repegged.  \n\n### Market Response to Freezing\n\nFollowing the market being frozen on May 16, we observed gradual withdrawals over the next four days, with about 1M sUSD withdrawn. However, starting May 20, withdrawals accelerated, and there are currently 5.16M sUSD deposited in the market.\n\nOn the other hand, the sUSD borrowed has been relatively stable, decreasing from 4.3M sUSD at the time of the freeze to 4.17M sUSD now. This is despite sUSD remaining depegged until May 21, incentivizing users who borrowed the asset to repay their debt. \n\nSynthetix has also [announced](https://blog.synthetix.io/transitioning-to-synthetix-v3-scaling-susd-migrating-snx/) its transition plan for V3, which details how it will scale sUSD. These updates include expanding the collateral assets for sUSD from SNX alone to SNX, ETH, USDC, and other yield-generating collateral and governance-approved tokens. Additionally, the protocol has incentivized sUSD liquidity providers on Velodrome (Optimism; 10,000 OP tokens per week in the sUSD/USDC pool) and Curve (Ethereum; 20,000 SNX tokens per week in the sUSD/USDC/DAI/USDT pool); liquidity has begun to improve as a result of these incentives.\n\n### sUSD Exposure on Aave\n\nsUSD is listed on Aave V3 Optimism as a frozen collateral asset and Aave V2 Ethereum as a frozen, non-collateral asset. Since the freeze on Optimism, we have observed a sharp decrease in value borrowed against sUSD, as well as the amount borrowed against sUSD in E-Mode. The reduction in E-Mode borrowed against is especially important, given the high LT afforded in this market.§\n\n# Recommendations\n\n- **Reduce Supply and Borrow Caps on Aave V3, Optimism:** Given that the market’s size has decreased, as well as a decrease in on-chain supply — from 31M pre-freeze to 23.6M now — we recommend decreasing the supply and borrow caps ahead of unfreezing the asset. This will ensure that any future growth in the market is controlled and risk is minimized.\n    - We recommend setting the caps according to our initial listing methodology, in which we determine the amount of an asset that can be liquidated with slippage lower than the LB, set at 1% in the stablecoin E-mode, and recommend the supply cap be double that amount. This leads us to a recommendation of a 7M sUSD supply cap and a borrow cap set at 80% of the supply cap at 5.6M sUSD.\n\n- **Reduce Stablecoin E-Mode LT and LTV:** We recommend reducing E-Mode LT and LTV for stablecoins in Optimism’s Stablecoin E-Mode. Reducing LTs will make the protocol more resilient to any potential depegs in the future, ensuring that there is larger buffer in the event a stablecoin’s price falls and liquidations occur. Additionally, lowering LTV will slightly reduce users’ stablecoin-stablecoin borrowing power, again reducing risk in these markets.\n    - A 2% LT reduction on the Optimism V3 stablecoin E-mode category will make 18 accounts eligible for liquidation, potentially inducing $25K in new liquidations.\n- **Adjust sUSD’s LTV and LT:** Following the freeze of sUSD, its non-E-Mode LTV was dropped to 0%. Its current LT is 75%. Increasing the LTV will allow users to borrow non-stablecoin assets against their collateral, while adjusting the LT downwards will ensure the protocol has a larger buffer in the event of liquidations, whether from a depeg or from appreciation of borrowed assets.\n    - We recommend increasing sUSD’s non-E-Mode LTV to 60% and reducing its non-E-Mode LT to 70%. At this time, this would lead to a negligible $8 in liquidation across 4 accounts.\n\n- **Unfreeze the sUSD market on** **Optimism:** While sUSD has repegged, we note that the ongoing [deprecation](https://governance.aave.com/t/susd-depeg-update-05-16-2024/17719/7?) of synth assets may continue to cause peg volatility. The discount rate, which dictates the value synth asset holders can receive when they redeem, will continue to be lowered in an effort to deprecate these markets. Synth asset holders may request a redemption at parity, which, in the future, may carry some time-based conditions (i.e., sUSD is sent to the redeeming user over the course of weeks or months) to reduce the potential impact on sUSD’s peg. While the Synthetix Council has an incentive to ensure redemptions of synth assets with minimal price impacts, whether to the synth assets or sUSD, these time-based conditions are not codified.\n    - Given this, as well as the reduced supply/borrow caps and E-Mode LT/LTV, we recommend unfreezing the market.\n\n**We would like to thank @kaleb and the Synthetix team for their collaboration, insights on the situation, and guidance on the protocol and governance mechanisms to stabilize the peg.**\n\n# Specification\n\n| Asset | Parameter | Current  | Recommended |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| sUSD | Supply Cap | 20,000,000 | 7,000,000 |\n| sUSD | Borrow Cap | 13,000,000 | 5,600,000 |\n| sUSD | LT | 75% | 70% |\n| sUSD | LTV | 0.0% | 60% |\n\n### Stablecoin E-Mode Specifications\n\n| Parameter | Current  | Recommended |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| LTV | 93% | 90% |\n| LT | 95% | 93% |\n\n# Next Steps\n\n1.
