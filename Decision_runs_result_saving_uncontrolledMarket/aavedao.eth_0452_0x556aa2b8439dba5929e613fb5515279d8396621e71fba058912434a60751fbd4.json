A later proposal will detail pool sizes, yield estimates and how this could after the $1 peg.\n\n# Introduction\n\nWhen shaping the liquidity strategy for GHO, we assessed various options with three main considerations:\n\n* Trading Pair\n* Decentralised Exchange (pool type)\n* Holistic Business Strategy\n\nThe largest trading pairs in Defi are ETH and USDC. For this reason we favour creating a USD stable coin liquidity pool and a LST / GHO liquidity pool.\n\n* USD stable coin liquidity pool\n* LST liquidity pool\n\nDeep stable coin liquidity helps GHO to retain it's $1 peg. Arbitrage trading is profitable with small price variations at large trade sizes. Therefore it is important to create a liquidity pool sufficient in size to facilitate large trade sizes with minimal price impact.\n\nAt launch, it is reasonable to expect volatility and minimal integrations in place at launch. As a result, the initial bootstraping phase is to be heavily dependent upon incentives to sustain liquidity and create peg resilience. When a spot price based oracle becomes available, we expect more sophisticated peg arbitrage strategies to become more readily available as yield strategy for various collateral types.\n\nThe Aave DAO and friend's veBAL holding is expected to play a material role in bootstrapping liquidity. Based upon our initial conversations, we believe Aave DAO will receive support in the form of veBAL to bootstrap GHO liquidity pools on Balancer.\n\n* Aave DAO\n* Reallocation of Protocol Fee Vote Incentive (PFVI)\n* Balancer Community Members\n* Aura Finance Community Members\n* Potentially Liquity\n* And Others\n\nAlthough gauges take some time to deploy, we anticipate the gauges being in production within as little as 1 week after launch.\n\n## Safety Module Considerations\n\nThe most dominant stable coins in Defi have centralised dependencies such as multisigs and off-chain counterparty risks etc... These centralised dependencies are less suitable for inclusion the SM. Similarly, any pool that includes an Aave Linear Pool, or aToken, shall be excluded from the SM due to systemic risk.\n\nThe following types of pools and assets are excluded from the SM:\n\n* Aave Linear Pools\n* USDC\n\nAdding GHO liquidity tokens into the SM helps achieve the following:\n\n* Sustain GHO liquidity\n* Diversifies the SM assets \n* GHO revenue slightly offsets SM costs\n\nLUSD is immutable and the most decentralised stable coin making it ideal for inclusion in the SM. More on this later. \n\n## Sustainability\n\nA key benefit of Aave Linear pools is that they deposit liquidity in Aave v3 and growing the Aave Boosted Pool on Balancer offers strategic benefit to Aave. A portion of yield derived from Aave Protocol is used attain BAL incentives, 32.5%. Lido DAO and Rocket Pool have both grown liquidity pools that can be mostly sustained by veBAL votes attained from Balancer's PFVI flywheel.\n\nThere is also the ability for Balancer DAO to redirect protocol fees used for bribing from the Aave Boosted Pool (bb-a-USD) towards the GHO/bb-a-USD or LST/GHO pool. The bb-a-USD pool currently has [$28.2M](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0xfebb0bbf162e64fb9d0dfe186e517d84c395f016000000000000000000000502) of liquidity. \n\nNaturally, TokenLogic can work with the Balancer community to redirect Balancer protocol fee funded vote incentives to preferential pools.\n\nGiven the DAO's veBAL holding, our preference is for the primary pool to be on Balancer where BAL incentives will exceed the trading fee revenue generated on other DEXs. Curve and Convex are further progressed along there inflation schedule relative to Balancer and Aura. Therefore, whilst minimising dependencies on non Aave DAO voters, Balancer is a relatively better option than curve. We do support the CRV/sdCRV position be used to support GHO on Curve Finance.\n\nWith respect to the 80/20 pool, by having a larger allocation to an Yield Bearing Token (YBT), more yield is generated to fund vote incentives via the PFVI mechanism. Aave will have the option to incorporate this pool into the SM and the emissions will lead to reduced SM expenditure over time.\n\n## Primary Liquidity Pools\n\nWe propose the following primary liquidity pools for GHO:\n\n1) GHO / bb-a-USD - ComposableStablePoolFactory\n2) LST / GHO (80/20) - Weighted Pool Factory\n3) GHO / LUSD - ComposableStablePoolFactory\n\nOf the three pools, pools 1 and 2 qualify as core pools on Balancer with >50% of the pool generating yield.\n\nWith the SM integration being very unlikely at launch, we view adding BPTS to the SM as a longer term GHO growth option for the community to consider. The Aave SM budget is expected to be the main source of incentives for sustaining the GHO/LUSD pool which contains no YBT and does not qualify as a Core Pool on Balancer. \n\nUpon completing the SM upgrade, the PFVI and SM budget can be reallocated. For example, pool 2 PFVI *could* be redirected to pool 1 because pool 2 and 3 are sustained from the SM budget. The SM integration has the potential to create long lasting and sustained liquidity for GHO. It also could lead to additional assets being sustained within the SM using the same budget. \n\nDiscussions with Liquity relating to LUSD/GHO pool are promising. Liquity has a small vlAURA holding which can be used to support liquidity on Balancer. Gauges can be created when GHO is launched and then, if the Aave community supports the BPT being added to the SM, a new smBPT gauge can be deployed.\n\nWith the prospect of the LST/GHO pool being added to the SM, we are open to LST communities commenting below and volunteering initiatives that support growing this pool.\n\n## Secondary Pools\n\nEvery liquidity pool that contains GHO is positive for the Aave ecosystem. Therefore, we are open to experimenting and working with as many teams as possible. \n\nTo summaries, the following GHO secondary pools are being explored on a variety of DEXs:\n\n* GHO / FRAX\n* GHO / MAI\n* GHO / OHM\n\nSeveral teams are keen to incorporate and support GHO liquidity pools. A GHO / FRAXBP pool is one example within the Curve Finance ecosystem and other early integrations could include Olympus, Sommelier, Mellow, Maverick, Uniswap, Swaap and MAI Finance (Qi DAO) and more. \n\nWe favour creating many secondary liquidity pools over time across a variety of protocols.\n\n# Future Considerations\n\nThe following considerations will influence the expected size of the liquidity pools:\n\n* GHO Supply cap (100M units)\n* veBAL support beyond Aave DAO\n* vlAURA support\n\n# Specification\n\nGHO primary pools on Balancer v2 are shown below:\n\n1) GHO / bb-a-USD - ComposableStablePoolFactory\n2) LST / GHO (80/20) - Weighted Pool Factory\n3) GHO / LUSD - ComposableStablePoolFactory\n\n# Next Steps\n\nAfter discussing and agreeing upon the GHO liquidity Pools, we will prepare a proposal for sizing the liquidity pools and present a plan for how to grow the liquidity.\n\nWe are hoping for comments below that indicate support from other communities which we will incorporate into the next proposal.\n\n# Disclaimer\n\n@TokenLogic currently receives funding from the Butter Delegate Campaign and is a contributor @Llamaxyz.

TokenLogic shall focus on Aave DAO finances and support GHO adoption.\n\n\n# Introduction\n\nMembers of the TokenLogic team have been contributing to Aave Protocol since mid 2020. More recently, the team has been expanding in preparation to better support our three focus areas:\n\n* Treasury Management\n* Safety Module modelling\n* GHO Adoption\n\nTokenLogic is a developer focused team with a proven track recorded dating back to March 2023 when the delegation platform was annouced. During this time we have delivered the following:\n\n* 5 AIPs, 6 payloads, several GHO related BIPs\n* [GHO liquidity pools analysis](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-gho-liquidity-pools-primary-pools-initial-strategy/14071)\n* Coordinated [7.7%](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-gho-liquidity-pools-primary-pools-initial-strategy/14071) veBAL support for GHO's launch\n* Stoodup an analytics platform \n* Launch of [GHO Analytics frontend](https://governance.aave.com/t/tokenlogic-delegate-platform/12516)\n\nThe team is growing and we onboarded an accounting team to start developing a Aave Financial Reporting (genesis to date) frontend, launch date mid/late Q4 2023.\n\n# Current & Future Areas of Focus\n\n The below provides a high level overview of our **key focus** areas:\n\n* **Treasury Management**\n    * Improving the risk adjusted return of DAO's assets\n        * Aave v2 to v3 migrations\n        * Swap long tail assets to ETH / stable coins\n    * Improving capital efficiency\n        * Convert wMATIC to MaticX & stMATIC\n    * Managing strategic assets\n        * Upgrades to Strategic Asset Manager v1 functionality as required\n    * Modelling asset purchase / bribe\n        * Participate in Quest/Bribe v acquiring asset\n    * Engage, collaborate and support community lead initiatives\n        * Example: How best to optimise CRV holding\n    * Oversee Protocol Owned Liquidity (POL) deployment\n        * If DAO elects to provide POL, ensure Boost is directed to holding to optimise returns and maintain the strategy through claiming and swapping/locking rewards.\n    * Design and create a contract for managing DAO's POL\n        * Perform swaps, claim incentives, transfer assets etc...\n    * Claim Aave Protocol revenue fees at the end of each month\n        * This bot is currently operated by Llama\n\n* **GHO Liquidity / Incentives Management**\n    * Create Liquidity Management Committee / Budget\n        * Provide modelling to support Committee decision making\n    * Liquidity Incentive Optimisation Analysis (Strategic Assets)\n        * Target pool sizes & APRs \n    * Explore synergies with Safety Module diversification\n        * Potential to include GHO liquidity pools\n        * We will lead this effort after Llama's contract finishes\n* **Financial Reporting**\n    * Runway forecast\n        * Specifically tracking asset balance and drawdown rates to show when other assets require being swapped to fund the DAO\n    * Budget and resource allocation\n        * Work with ACI and others to develop a DAO budget\n    * Transparent accurate, third party reviewed, accessible financial statments\n        * Launch a financial statment frontend mid/late Q4 2023\n        * Cover Ethereum, Polygon (PoS), Arbitrum, Optimism and Avalanche initially and expand over time.\n        * Quarterly financial publications \n    * Revenue per Reserve v time charts\n        * Daily or Hourly data showing revenue being generated per Reserve on each Aave v2 and v3 iteration\n        * Users will be able to select an asset and see total revenue noiminated in the underlying or select an instance of Aave and a specific asset.\n        * Data will be displayed graphically with some ability to interact with the charts\n* **Supporting GHO Adoption**\n    * Collaborate with other teams to support GHO adoption\n        * Promote utility and velocity\n    * Continual development of GHO Analytics frontend\n    * Promote adoption through DeFi integrations\n        * Examples include working with teams to build real yield strategies, structured products and list GHO as collateral\n* **Safety Module Improvements**\n    * Model the SM performance during shortfall events\n        * Create a frontend that show historical performance for swapping certain amounts of each asset instantly (not dutch auction) via an aggregator\n    * Model / forecast emission budget\n        * AAVE emissions are finite, GHO is better\n        * Capital efficiency could be improved through adoption of quests and/or acquiring assets that control the emission schedule of another protocol\n    * Advocate for diversification and reducing the reward budget\n        * Introduction of stable coins, ETH and other assets to reduce reliance on AAVE during shortfall events\n    * Collaborate with others to refine to enhance the SM's effectiveness at providing a backstop for Aave Protocol\n        * BGD to implement on-chain upgrades\n        * Model liquidity pool assets to be added to SM\n        * Work with ACI, BGD, Llama and others to determine a target coverage, implementation of proposals and refine the asset blend\n\nEach of the areas detailed above is interwoven and has a material affect on the DAO's financial status. TokenLogic is committed to working with other DAO contributors collaboratively and constructively to better the Aave Protocol. \n\nTo support the initiatives aboves, we have created an analytics platform. The GHO dashboard is our first analytics initiative. Beyond GHO, we plan on using the analytics platform to provide the DAO with near live revenue data stream for each asset reserve on supported networks. We seek to always incorporate community feedback and build out any requests from the community.\n\nOur team is very well connected across defi and we intend to support Aave and GHO where ever we can. To this end, we are already working with several teams looking to integrate GHO and have been working with @0xbilll at AGD with targeted spending initiatives.\n\nTo ensure continuation of active work scopes, TokenLogic will continue to manage the migration of users on Polygon v2 to v3. This includes either fortnightly or monthly parameter adjustments. We encourage another service provider to pick up the Avalanche v2 migration.

Currently, the SM is overly concentrated in AAVE via direct AAVE staking and ABPT staking which is a Balancer v1 80/20 AAVE/wETH liquidity token.\n\nThis publication seeks to explore the community's appetite to diversify the SM asset base and vary the portion of users' funds which can be auctioned in the event of a shortfall. Currently, 30% of user deposits are at risk when depositing into the SM.\n\n# Motivation\n\n@bgdlabs is currently proposing to upgrade the [SM architecture](https://governance.aave.com/t/bgd-aave-safety-module-v1-5/12148) to support the launch of GHO, by enabling stkAAVE holders to access cheaper GHO borrowing rates. Further to this, Llama has kick started the conversation around migrating AAVE liquidity from Balancer v1 to v2 in this [forum post](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-safety-module-update-part-i-migrate-aave-weth-balancer-v1-pool-to-balancer-v2/12748).\n\nSeveral comments relating to the AAVE concentration and auction mechanism have been made on the forum which can be found [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/size-x-aave-auction-safety-module/11984), [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/discussion-safety-module/12029) and [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-extend-safety-module-coverage-to-polygon-v3/11876/4).\n\nThis publication presents three distinct categories for inclusion in the SM.\n\n* Single Asset\n* Volatile Asset Liquidity Positions\n* Stable Asset Liquidity Positions\n\nThe net change to the existing implementation is the introduction of a third category, Stable Asset Liquidity Positions. The existing AAVE and ABPT represent Single Asset and Volatile Asset Liquidity Positions.\n\nAlthough any Liquidity Provider (LP) position can be included, G-Uni, crvLP, BPT etc… This publication will initially focus on the overarching concept and how BPTs could be integrated.\n\nBPTs were selected due to Aave’s relationship with Balancer DAO and the veBAL holding which the community may elect to utilize here. It should be stressed, Aave DAO will elect which assets are to be included and the varying levels of slashing for each category.\n\nAssets considered for inclusion should have minimal counterparty risk and display great on-chain liquidity amongst other considerations such as price correlation with Aave Protocol’s TVL during varying market conditions.\n\nLlama proposes three initial asset categories to be created within the SM.\n\nThe slashing parameters update aims to reduce the price impact on the AAVE token in the case of a shortfall event. We propose adding different levels of slashing to each category, as follows:\n\n## Single Assets\n\nThe current single asset, with 30% slashing, is AAVE. This proposal introduces other assets to this category with the goal of reducing the concentration of AAVE inside the insurance fund.\n\nPossible assets for consideration inside the SM Single Asset Category include, not limited to:\n\n* AAVE\n* ETH and/or wstETH\n\nIf the community elects with the introduction of additional assets other than AAVE, then each asset could be considered individually. This publication retains the 30% slashing feature for Single Asset.\n\nThe inclusion of wstETH may attract additional incentives from Lido DAO, therefore Llama prefers having the ability to distribute multiple rewards types with external teams able to distribute their own token. Something similar to the Emission Admin role on Aave v3 will suffice.\n\nLlama preference is for wstETH over wETH due to improved capital efficiency by enabling users to earn an overall higher APY from being a SM depositor. wstETH has become a major trading pairing token on Balancer and it has ample liquidity across various pools to route swaps through. Additionally, the stETH-ETH discount has reduced significantly (0.9938:1 for 100K ETH sold, which also demonstrates [very deep liquidity](https://swap.defillama.com/?chain=ethereum&from=0xae7ab96520de3a18e5e111b5eaab095312d7fe84&to=0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000).\n\nLlama would also encourage Lido DAO to indicate any potential support for this type of integration between the two protocols as inclusion in the SM would act to help retain or grow wstETH adoption via the creation of a unique use case for wstETH relative to other LSTs.\n\nMax slashing proposed: 30% retained for single assets.\n\nInitial assets proposed: AAVE / ETH and/or stETH\n\n## Risks Considerations\n\nIf LSTs (such as wstETH) are included in the SM, it creates a price divergence risk which, if sustained, can reduce the cover in the SM and create an unfair distribution of the rewards between ETH & wstETH. Post redemption the main risk consideration for LSTs becomes counterparty risk which if it materialized would lead to a significant discount to the LST price in ETH terms.\n\n* To limit the de-peg risk, the SM could stop incentivizing below a defined ratio, so the total value would then be deduced from the total cover value. This acts to mitigate counterparty risk without requiring governance intervention.\n\nBased upon technical feedback relating to the ease of implementation, Llama may revise this section of the publication.\n\n## Volatile Liquidity Provider Tokens\n\nIn addition to the replacement pool for the 80/20 AAVE/wETH pool on Balancer v1, to be determined by an earlier publication. This publication presents two other pools of strategic importance to Aave DAO for inclusion in the SM.\n\nThis publication presents the prospect of creating an 80/20 GHO/wETH (or wstETH) which offers less impermanent loss than a 50/50 pool whilst also providing very deep liquidity for risk off events which see spikes in stable coin swap volumes which can often lead to stable coins trading above $1.\n\nFor the following categories, up to 75% of the current budget could be allocated.\n\nMax slashing proposed 45% for volatile BPTs\n\nInitial volatile BPTs proposed: B-80AAVE-20wstETH (or Part I proposal results) & B-80GHO-20WETH\n\nEven if not yet created, this is probably the most interesting addition to this category as the trading volume of this pool will generate an important yield for LPs. The second pool could also be converted into a [Balancer Core Pool](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-19-incentivize-core-pools-l2-usage/3329) by replacing ETH by IBTs as described in Part I.\n\n## Stable Liquidity Provider Tokens\n\nIn this third category, this publication presents an initial pool consisting of the Balancer [3pool](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0x79c58f70905f734641735bc61e45c19dd9ad60bc0000000000000000000004e7) and GHO. Like other categories, in the future, additional assets can be added. If the community elects to launch BB-A-USD/GHO on Balancer or a stable coin pool on Curve, then this section can pivot to include the Curve pool.\n\nMax slashing proposed: 60% for stable\n\nInitial Stable BPT proposed: B-3Pool/GHO\n\nThis pool introduces a stable asset to the SM design and generates a significant amount of the coverage as 60% of the TVL can be slashed with very low price impact across the broader ecosystem. This is especially the case if something like Cowswap’s auction mechanism was to feature in the new SM auction mechanism.\n\nBy integrating a GHO pair to the SM, Aave is essentially helping bootstrapping GHO adoptions through incentivised liquidity. Aave will also earn revenue from the GHO borrowing rate.\n\nIf the community elects to proceed with 3CRV/GHO, then this would increase the SM smart contract surface area through diversifying exposure concentration away from Balancer to include Cuve Finance and potentially Convex Finance risk as well.\n\nThere is also the option of adding additional pools which could include GHO, MAI, LUSD, FRAX and others once live like crvUSD etc…\n\nThis proposal can be implemented independently from the following parts. In this case, “classic” gauges would be advised. Otherwise, the strategy & smBPT gauges discussions will be outlined & discussed in Part III.\n\n# Technical Specifications:\n\n* Remove the BPT 80/20 from the current main module (30% slashing)\n* Deploy two other modules on the SM for the new categories (45% & 60% slashing)\n* Implement the new assets voted on Part II for the new categories\n* Create the new pools depending on vote results\n\n# Voting Options\n\nYAE - Implement Changes\nNAE- Rework Proposal\nABSTAIN\n\n# Disclaimer\n\nThe Llama is not compensated by any of the mentioned communities outside of Aave.\n\nLlama is an unpaid delegate within the Balancer ecosystem.\n\nMembers who contributed to this proposal are not angel investors or advisors to any of the mentioned communities but some do hold small holdings in those communities tokens.\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n\n# References\n\n1.

These rewards allow Aave to attract deposits, where up to 30% can be used to insure the protocol in case of shortfall event. At the moment, 100% of these incentives are spent in liquidity mining from the Ecosystem Reserve, which represents $89.3K daily or $32.6M yearly expense for the DAO.\n\nThis publication presents the community with an opportunity to reshape how AAVE incentives are distributed to significantly improve Aave’s economics and enhance the capital efficiency of the SM.\n\n* Increased Backstop Value\n* Decreased AAVE Spend\n* Increased Yield for depositors\n* Improved Profitability and Financial Sustainability\n\nThis publication focuses on how incentives are distributed to reduce the overall AAVE spend without exceeding the current AAVE budget & shares the estimated results from the strategy.\n\n# Rationale\n\nA quick recap of proposed from the current design so far:\n\n* Part I - SstkABPT update proposal (Part I)\n  * Support of the migration to a new BPT B-80-AAVE-20wstETH\n\n* Part II - Categories implementation (Part II)\n  * Single assets, volatile BPTs and stable BPTs.\n\n* Part II- Slashing update (Part II)\n  * Each category will have a different max slashing parameter\n\n* Part III -BPT positions staked on the SM - smBPTs (Part III)\n  * Create gauges for smBPTon staked assets and enable users to receive to avoid incentives dilution, Introduce smBPT wrapper, and explain Aura Finance strategy to receive BAL & AURA rewards.\n\nThis publication presents a revised outlook on how the majority of the current AAVE budget could be distributed as vote incentives for smBPT gauges. Additionally, the DAO could decide to optimize its strategic voting power to reduce the SM costs.\n\nDo note the APR generated from depositing into the SM has dependencies such as the BAL, AURA and AAVE token prices. If this proposal is approved, several solutions can be explored to reduce this risk. If it becomes unprofitable over time because of BAL or AURA prices, a fallback option can be added to switch back to the current LM design if needed until finding a better optimization.\n\nThe design is flexible enough to accommodate various market conditions and for Aave to pivot from AAVE to GHO rewards over time. This represents a shift on the base incentives from Aave governance token distribution to yield derived from cash flow sustained by the business.This will allow to improve the fallback option to always optimize the best yield between direct profit sharing distributed or used to leverage more yield through votes incentives.\n\n## veBAL Voting Power\n\nLlama recently published a proposal to deploy the BAL holdings. This proposal will help provide a better understanding of why Llama recommended the community to vote for acquiring veBAL.\n\nOverview of the veBAL position if locked today:\n\n![|566x186](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/2xlP4WbgttqDygSf06fk1AyRlqdq8JgW_xVGyPyZnkcNpN9EEGFfY_H_VMcVozZY9mrdzrQrp37PxbXQkSUxTjHYvsavlxyvvFFGqoHp80eLqjc7owdYdFugJ40Tp7xs2nbYZoKnNRk7dWkO9wzx5CA)\n\nETH needed and the LP tokens amount received are verified with https://balancer.tools/veBAL.\n\n![|414x79](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/LECeCOxUTEB4UlvHAyEaCa3FEImGhUYGdDxKUCULK_eqW7dU9V4MaEF70AH6pJFHOMSjM-KaCjcJ-T_l8qG_sSu-L611Ctjk6JejFn6pDxWe1r13IIa9dsVQ2mYsgykdgYqIyFO2LqE73491CcNtjE0)\n\nThe table above shows how much weekly BAL emission is controlled, assuming the DAO uses only its owned veBAL voting power (i.e. without creating vote incentives).These calculations are based on the BAL emission in April 2023: 121,930 BAL/week instead of 145,000 until March 2023.\n\nAave DAO voting power is a good start and can be utilized to support, not limited to, the below strategies:\n\n* Help sustain the Safety Module yield\n* Grow and sustain the GHO liquidity\n* Boost the Staked aTokens gauges\n* Redirect incentives on existing Balancer pools\n* Optimize the yield on treasury strategies\n\nHowever, due to the limited veBAL holding size relative to Aave’s aspirations, the community will need to choose between the choices above. Several other possibilities to increase the strategic voting power accumulation in addition to the reserve factors earnings are presented below:\n\n* [Deploy treasury strategies to farm BAL/AURA with stables & ETH](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-deploy-ethereum-collector-contract/12205)\n\n* [Acquire more BAL/start acquire AURA with the treasury to lock it ](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-strategic-partnership-with-balancer-part-2/7813)\n* Potential Grants from Aura & Balancer\n\n## Safety Module Cover Overview\n\nAssuming that 100% of the Aave TVL was covered by the SM, the DAO would pay 30,02% on its insurance.\n\n![|602x59](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/_4IccaU07Rbv86PhERhDx1iYKoJDNE01HRG31zy3tSaqw0OAn_RY8AufyPgdDFLddVifzmD4xQmow_tzDYmH7yzg7gTbRUEu94dP_AgnVEl5sbwx5GviMWSSMue0ulB1eFAn5HTE0QgBNF4rBqGWgSI)\n\n(1.43% of the TVL is currently covered and the DAO which pays 30,02% APR on these funds). The new strategy aims to increase the Safety Module coverage above 2.00% while also reducing insurance costs by at least 30%.\n\n## Incentives Distribution Upgrade\n\nNote that all TVLs below have been added to estimate the max capacity of the SM with the current budget by maintaining the APR in range.\n\n### Single Assets\n\nThis publication features continuing the rewards with 25% of the current budget for single assets. At a later date, the community can explore progressively replacing AAVE with GHO rewards.\n\n* AAVE: TVL Estimation used for the upcoming calculations:\n\n60% of the current stkAAVE TVL\n\nWe estimate a reduction of the TVL due to the APR lowered by the budget reallocation\n\n(200 AAVE/day until GHO is live vs 550 AAVE/day at the moment.) .\n\n* ETH / stETH: TVL Estimation used for the upcoming calculations:\n\n75k ETH / stETH\n\n(Llama proposes to allocate a budget of 75 AAVE/day to reward ETH and/or stETH deposits until GHO is live)\n\nThis means reducing the liquidity mining by focusing it on single assets only, since it’s not possible to add gauges for it. The remaining AAVE currently being spent in LM to incentivize both veBAL & vlAURA voters on Warden Quest, which allows to redirect rewards on smBPTs gauges, in a better proportion than LM.\n\n## What is Warden Quest?\n\nWarden Quest by Paladin, offers a new approach to Gauge Weight vote acquisition for Curve & Balancer. Instead of offering an arbitrary amount of rewards to influence voters, Quest allows players to set parameters & rewards for each weekly vote period.\n\nAfter the rewards distribution to voters, if the total budget wasn't spent (i.e.,if the objective wasn't reached), Quest creators can redeem the unspent budget minus the fees.\n\nAdditionally, Quest now offers the possibility for vlAURA holders to claim rewards from veBAL quests, allowing Aave DAO to create vote incentives for both at once.\n\nFinally, with the estimated budget of this post, Quest fees would be at 2,8% instead of 4%.\n\nNote: This proposal doesn’t plan to create vote incentives on the StakedATokens gauges, but the DAO could vote to do it later. In such a case, the Quest weekly volume would lead to the lowest fee possible: 2%. More information on Warden Quest can be found [here](https://doc.paladin.vote/warden-quest/introduction).\n\n## Volatile & Stable BPTs\n\nThe SM Upgrade strategy aims to maintain the volatile BPTs APR in the 8 to 12% range, and the stable BPTs APR in the 18 to 22% range. The BAL & AURA rewards could be distributed weekly to SM depositors.\n\n* B-80AAVE-20wstETH: Max TVL estimation used: $100M\n\n* B-80GHO-20wETH: Max TVL estimation used: $50M$\n\n* B-GHO-3Pool: Max TVL estimation used: $100M\n\n![|602x132](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/SpKMcUQtiB4wEV4_28TEmzln1kV-XvgxaMWl8b7Gskws4NyE3R4_s4sGxGCBSzI8EDv254g8Jep_kTdi74E4OEEzYijcNq56-6Kxp-0KGO2_NrquOGi0ll3R-RtSEB9XO2oAqzoR9sFhHQWkGr6Gpfw)\n\nThese estimations demonstrate the possibility of reaching the APR targets outlined above.\n\nThe vlAURA votes amount needed is defined by a target in veBAL votes, which is why the total exceeds 100% of the vlAURA supply.The veBAL votes target can be reached by creating vote incentives for veBAL, vlAURA, veTETU and sdBAL, all supported on Quest.\n\nNote: veTETU vote incentives would require more management as veTETU on Polygon, so we’ve excluded it from this proposal for now. sdBAL vote incentives are also excluded because of the small veBAL holdings.\n\n![|602x152](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/64YqdC6KmmZAUULAUOg71tPIv1c0B1bLlomXQ6jJVgcwf18mWUMAcZhdcBvdLhi7NjPLJYoTftfl2YPxsZ179v8u_ogbq0Es3U61gptCID7YD1QnxsNL61f3bfMhaRz4N1669rUJTy9jGyy4SyjN4R0)\n\n(Yellow cells are manually added & Orange cells are max estimated TVL. The remaining data are calculated or imported from Etherscan and CoinGecko data in real time, so numbers are changing very often depending on all the variables).\n\n## smBPTs Quests Results Overview\n\n![|602x83](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/xmMXkpyZUu4J7HJC9r_b0lZyKGiWp-_LXkst-HVh9QRFTuHuMXCiWC0aNI_aOdckGrvTfu1Zt6Q9uLKFDRfqaFT9vZUOLIbsDe04lrjVEppw9sb8li1bbpVKsTkZZc3ACHIhUQkcQzx_6z1mEokw7bM)\n\nThe cost per vlAURA/round is from [Llama Airforce](https://llama.airforce/#/bribes/rounds/hh/aura-bal/8).\n\nThe vlAURA votes are priced 2% above the last round's prices, as this market does fluctuate a lot (1 round = 2 weeks). Aave would need to control ~30,08% of the veBAL voting supply on the SM gauges to reach the target APRs shown above.\n\nThe table above demonstrates that Aura is way more interesting than Balancer without max boost. Creating the same vote incentives but farming on Balancer would not be profitable.\n\nIn this strategy, the SM depositors would earn $194,000/round ($97,000/week) in extra BAL & AURA rewards directed with votes incentives compared to AAVE tokens liquidity mining distribution.\n\nWhile the TVL max estimations are high in this proposal, this helped define the max capacity of this strategy with the current budget, evaluate the yield possibilities, and learnt the communities sentiment. However, the goal is to progressively increase the TVL target & associated votes incentives budget.\n\nThe requested amount of votes and rewards requires an active management to optimize the Quests, which is why this publication leans away from using Snapshot to determine Aave’s veBAL gauges votes and instead recommends considering different options to optimize the votes, which will be presented in the voting framework proposed in the coming days.\n\nIf the Quests are not filled, the unspent rewards can be redeemed by the DAO (minus the fees) and used for the next round. In this case, a fallback budget should be planned to temporarly compensate part of the yield in liquidity mining initially, then in GHO over time. .\n\nTo avoid this to happen, the strategy considers paying slightly more per vote than the market based on previous round price, to align the economic interest of the protocol and the voters to make sure the votes target are reached. OTC deals could also be discussed with important voters in this ecosystem.\n\n![|706x118](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/zTMjQiAa0TUwZ5MiVQPW9OROSRkoRj1XhD6LuEFdL0hK_TGp713OdJOv1R7a9SZuuWJP3Dm9wlXoPSf878NSzbr9Q9E74Yd3iwpRfNwwNc-uQjPLTwlVTK85No_OmJ3wdVjiROx1ocIh1pCauoAGGE4)\n\nThe AAVE amount spent in vote incentives in the table below is changing very often as defined by several parameters, such as the amount of votes required, the price for veBAL & vlAURA votes, the AAVE token price, the TVL in the smBPT gauges, and later on, governance updates on the SM design proposed if the budget is changed.\n\nWith the above estimations, there is a reduction of the daily LM budget, which can be accumulated as a fallback budget to avoid the unfavorable situation explained above.\n\n![|368x81](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/7RQIzjSHyb9w7XIsffWS78g0smGilUe8Dco3vuymbmWPRBTak9Darub-3m7FLuDTULG17gYabPNiAoq3DDScnWkttSAJJzx7-s28LQBjBEtlSJYRWpqm0kIwyLBtwF5BUsmmfoqQuwcyTEt4PuMpH-I)\n\nAs expected, the cover cost (insurance APR) is also reduced by half, which validates the last goal of this proposal.\n\n![|515x271](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/tR9EqP3W5s0SMSNuM5QnBfwq_dSnrZm3OAlylx5AAG7ExYpDgSNDLizhWMpukSfKhEEWtUw9yBxr-_xHvcBSeFkPpaLKDoFgl_7LYBO0t2Wh7TpMxxxzbN8rRhAPPE7ec-Vzh5HalS1-xsdsEZ3Lkag)\n\nThe last table in Part IV and the 2 above demonstrate that with current market metrics & estimated TVL, the APRs reached on Aura are in the range expected, as well as the average insurance cost reduction from 30,02% to 17,23% and the cover increase from $119M to $175M.\n\nAlso, considering that this strategy will help with both growing the SM (TVL & Cover) and improving the liquidity for Aave tokens, other incentive budgets for GHO liquidity or liquidity mining on StakedATokens could be used for the same strategy.\n\nActions related to the strategic voting power and votes incentives management will be defined by the framework proposal defined in part V, such as:\n\n* Lock veToken assets into Balancer and Aura to generate increased rewards.\n* Create votes incentives on Quest\n* Update the boost power, delegate or sell it on Warden if unused.\n* Vote on gauges & proposals decisions\n* Claim protocol fees\n\n# Technical Implementations:\n\n* Enable weekly distribution for Stable & Volatile BPT rewards\n* Whitelist the AAVE token on Quest as reward (No extra proposal needed)\n* Define the Aave voting framework (Part V)\n\n# Voting options:\n\nYAE - Update the incentives management strategy\nNAE - Continue classic liquidity mining\nABSTAIN\n\n# Disclaimer\n\nThe Llama is not compensated by any of the mentioned communities outside of Aave.\n\nLlama is an unpaid delegate within the Balancer ecosystem. Some members of Llama are unpaid delegates in the Paladin ecosystem.\n\nMembers who contributed to this proposal are not angel investors or advisors to any of the mentioned communities but some do hold small holdings in those communities tokens.\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n\n# References\n\n1.

However, in line with the [TEMP CHECK](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-gho-liquidity-pools/13655), the DAO’s veBAL holding should be used to support the three primary pools.\n\nIn addition to Aave DAO’s veBAL holding, several veBAL & vlAURA holders have expressed an intention to help bootstrap GHO liquidity pools. We would like to give a special thank you to the Balancer and Aura community members for their contributions.\n\nThis proposal will try to estimate the gauge power allocated to GHO pools & the potential yield depending on several TVL estimations for each primary pool. In analyzing the potential liquidity conditions, three scenarios are presented.\n\n![|637x109](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/A5xYXlMR_mzanGEWrFjaSNbkao9Zykhi7yKDs2SIMrM_a-mfm9qfsVuX3cmllOazmUkJ-2ewKzf_OKcQ7KOk3UI3UKhiGNrM4L_bW50VDz8Zi9WByYPVVwDRUJU6hclu64kZ96cjz-jFzs2eZnQO7ss)\n\nWhile the initial GHO supply is expected to be 100M, additional cap increases can be implemented and voted so this can also help to visualize how the supported voting power can scale.\n\nFor the purpose of this proposal, it has been assumed that all relevant positions are continuously relocked to maximize the voting rights.\n\nAave DAO is contributing 1.81% of the ~ 7,7% veBAL and the remainder is coming from teams that TokenLogic has been coordinating with. Do note, there are dependencies on these contributors to maintain the voting support over time. Initial discussions indicate that in 2-3 months time, some veBAL and vlAURA holders are expected to revisit there allocations.\n\n## Estimated veBAL gauge power to bootstrap GHO at launch\n\nThe below table presents the initial veBAL and vlAURA expected to support GHO’s launch and Aave DAO’s veBAL holding. Aave DAO holds 157,169.86 B-80BAL-20WETH to be converted to an estimated 1.80% of veBAL supply by [Llama.](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-treasury-management-introducing-strategicassetmanager/13916) The table below shows the distribution of veBAL and vlAURA support for the main three GHO pools.\n\n![|660x69](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/5lG1ZsmoHS7KZQGqh61NWikdaq6PbYDnsi2_VcZq1Il4nyF6GenO8_fDM7TACCqXWDDGZBPz5hLZrVYqpS7dgNDXcTQ96pG2MgnWISFhCTLYeAKR6ZNltmYDkr3Gep4BrImZHISaXaipuOoGuBeOEVo)Aave DAO with support from friends is expected to support GHO with 5.5% of veBAL later this week and 7.7% upon Aave DAO converting its B-80BAL-20WETH to veBAL. Subject to timing, some veBAL support from friends may taper when Aave DAO starts voting.\n\n## Estimations of BAL emissions & AURA rewards\n\nThe following estimations are based on vlAURA voting rounds & votes amount, but converted from the actual veBAL equivalent amount of support: 1 vlAURA = 0,1726 veBAL votes.\n\nWe propose Aave DAO split the veBAL voting weight as per below.\n\n* 40% used to vote on the GHO/bb-a-USD V3 pool\n* 40% used to vote on the GHO/LUSD pool\n* 20% used to vote on the 80/20 wstETH/GHO pool\n\nDo note, the voting weight can be changed periodically with each successive gauge vote.\n\n## 1) Aave DAO\n\nThe split proposed below is open for discussion in the comments section. However, later sections show the significance of Aave Friends voting support. We encourage the veBAL and vlAURA support to be view holistically and not just through the lens of Aave DAO’s holding.\n\n![|711x49](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/Ya2Y1vJVK1Fg3d2gvoREbTGvfYZZQiUa0bhq4OJu0bqnkAyMJSAcXkteAlKQWotthRJAm_8FKZHoII_OMsn9KQmMAaF-v3oNHhB1-V4rhJUEUu3ub2JrRNLPfjjkrELLK6SyDF5r7URWAXSrnGpZi0U)\n\nRewards breakdown for the Aave DAO after the B-80BAL-20WETH is converted to veBAL holding:\n\n![|660x137](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/SG0AU1D4fWBjPK6FRSNQ8NVll-IvKk5ZwzTBs61iJYLa8WCbqhj7pABmiJFetg7yQn5x-r7PgqH03cC4UddgYSpskltJBOpS6Z5EYD2Y4NR1yp8qJLUiU2sAIcoAGS_FThOnXItmUtuam5htDH2kWpo)\n\nFor the three TVL scenarios being considered, the following APRs are estimated:\n\n![|660x97](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/zi02UdPUDy1BYSeg_N8qZ0SNxkjTsj9zMgQKyP8dlPW5VwBYLv1beBtVeS1Ub1KGTpRorGrVEdp8tzU51YPWnVqDS7Fog_I7fUAdkbqy-pGyzS-dxRU-IO4_MQ0S96EeeEH1SpEErqNyKZDhi53PpEM)\n\nNaturally, TokenLogic will work with the Balancer community to redirect Balancer protocol fee funded vote incentives to preferential pools.

Once the above items are executed, the shortExecutor will implement the above gauge weight votes via the Strategic Asset Manager contract being deployed by Llama.\n\nAlternatively, a Treasury Committee can be created and assigned the AssetManager role enabling the votes to be implemented.\n\n# Future Considerations\n\nWhen presenting the analysis, there are several assumptions that affect the accuracy of the model over time. The most notable variables are mentioned below:\n\n* TVL in the pools\n* Duration of Aave Friends support\n* Frequency of re-locks (maximizing the veBAL voting rights)\n* Vote allocation\n* Aura Boost\n\nTo reduce this dependency on external parties, TokenLogic will publish three proposals in the near future:\n\n* Initiate Protocol Owned Liquidity (leading to increased strategic assets accumulation)\n* Create Treasury Committee\n* Initial GHO Liquidity Incentives Budget\n\n# Disclaimer\n\n@TokenLogic currently receives funding from the Butter Delegate Campaign and is a contributor @Llamaxyz.
