        "body": "### **Abstract**\n\nThis AIP seeks to propose changes to the structure of the security council so Arbitrum can maintain the “Stage 1” designation as per L2BEAT and not fall back to “Stage 0” designation.\n\n### **Motivation**\n\nOn December 7, [L2BEAT published an update](https://medium.com/l2beat/stages-update-security-council-requirements-4c79cea8ef52) to the security council requirements for the [Stages Framework](https://medium.com/l2beat/introducing-stages-a-framework-to-evaluate-rollups-maturity-d290bb22befe). The requirements were updated after a lot of research and feedback to make Stages more formal and precise. \n\n### **Rationale**\n\nUpgrading the security council as per the Stage 1 requirements set by L2BEAT, will help ensure Arbitrum remains decentralized, but properly secured. See ‘Specifications’ for more details.\n\n### **Key Terms**\n\n**Stages:** A framework, inspired by [Vitalik’s proposed milestones](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/proposed-milestones-for-rollups-taking-off-training-wheels/11571), that categorises rollups into three distinct stages based on their reliance on these training wheels. You can learn [more about the Stages framework here](https://medium.com/l2beat/introducing-stages-a-framework-to-evaluate-rollups-maturity-d290bb22befe).\n\n**Security Council:** A group of 12 individuals who are responsible for addressing risks to the Arbitrum ecosystem through the selective application of **e**mergency actions and non-emergency actions. Learn more in [the ArbitrumDAO Docs](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/concepts/security-council).\n\n**Timelock:** Smart contracts which implement a delay between an upgrade confirmation and execution.\n\n**Exit Window:** The actual time users have to exit the system in case of an unwanted upgrade.\n\n### **Specifications**\n\nArbitrum currently has two multisigs and they both contain the same set of members:\n\na) A 9/12 multisig with instant upgrade power \n\nb) A 7/12 multisig that can upgrade with a 3+7+3 days delay \n\nWhile the higher threshold multisig can be classified as a Security Council, the lower one is below the minimum threshold and it’s considered a simple multisig according to the Stages framework introduced above.\n\nFor normal multisigs, L2BEAT requires at least a 7 days exit window for users. The current exit window for Arbitrum is 2 days (see [this thread](https://x.com/stonecoldpat0/status/1737840485967032739?s=20) for a quick explanation).\n\nMoreover, the higher threshold multisig is supposed to stop malicious upgrades attempted by the lower threshold multisig. However, since the member set is the same, if the lower threshold agrees on something there are not enough members in the higher threshold to stop them, which means that the actual security of the upgradeability mechanism boils down to the 7/12 threshold.\n\nFor the above reason, technically, with the updated requirements for Stages, Arbitrum falls back to the Stage 0 designation. Since we know that it takes time to upgrade Arbitrum, we decided to leave the Stage 1 designation with the promise of addressing the above issues in a timely manner. This proposal is about addressing the issues and moving them to be voted on by the DAO.\n\n**Proposed Solutions**\n\n1) The **first solution** would be to remove the lower threshold (7/12) multisig entirely. This can be done in two ways:\n\n1. The contract is removed which requires an on-chain upgrade, or,\n2. The lower threshold multisig increases its threshold from 7/12 to 9/12 which requires no upgrade.\n\nIncreasing the threshold gives us the flexibility to restore a lower threshold in the future should the need arise, and it’s also a very quick and easy fix since it doesn’t require an on-chain upgrade.\n\nOn the other hand, removing the dependency on the lower threshold mutlisig for all the contracts in Arbitrum is a broad and potentially risky change. Therefore we suggest raising the threshold for the time being and revisiting the removal of all the dependencies at a later date if needed.\n\n2) The **second solution** would be to leave the lower threshold multisig as it is, but to increase the exit window to 7 days. In practice, this involves increasing the L2 timelock delay from 3 days to 8 days, since there is a 1 day max delay to force transactions on Arbitrum via L1 using the ‘DelayedInbox’. Increasing the L1 Timelock would not be very beneficial due to delay attacks on the fraud proof systems, since, even with BoLD,  the challenge period would end up being up to [16 days](https://x.com/DZack23/status/1737864854059335905?s=20).\n\n3) The **third solution**, which is not strictly required by the Stages Framework for the Stage 1 designation, is to both remove the lower threshold multisig entirely and increase the L2 Timelock delay so users have more time to exit in case of unwanted upgrades, increasing the security of the system even more.\n\n### Steps to Implement\n\nFollowing a week of discussion of this RFC, the proposal will go for a vote on Snapshot with the following 6 options (as they are or slightly adjusted), and/or any additional ones, should they arise from the discussion during the RFC phase:\n\n1. Increase the threshold from 7/12 to 9/12.\n2. Increase the L2 timelock delay from 3 days to 8 days.\n3. Increase the threshold and the L2 timelock delay.\n4. Make no changes.\n\nFollowing the temp-check, if any of the aforementioned options apart from No.4 is the most popular, the proposal will move to on-chain vote to execute the proposal.\n\n### **Overall Cost**\n\nThere’s no overhead to the DAO for the implementation of this proposal.\n\n### **Timeline**\n\n**RFC -** January 11th to January 18th\n\n**Snapshot -** January 18th to January 25th\n\n**On-Chain Vote:** January 30th to February 13th\n\n**Execution Delay:**\n\n- February 13th to February 16th - L2 Waiting Period\n- February 16th to February 23rd - L2-to-L1 Message\n- February 23rd to February 27th - L1 Waiting Period\n\n**Please note the aforementioned timeline is tentative and the actual timeline might be slightly different.**",

        "body": "This Snapshot vote aims to solicit a temperature check from the ArbitrumDAO on their stance for bringing the BoLD upgrade to Arbitrum One and Nova. BoLD is a new dispute resolution protocol that unlocks permissionless validation for Arbitrum chains and enhances their security by mitigating the risk of delay attacks.\n\nFor more information, please refer to the original [BoLD AIP Forum Post](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-bold-permissionless-validation-for-arbitrum/23232) where you will find public audit reports, the BoLD whitepaper (that contain the formal specification and safety proofs), as well as further explanations of how BoLD works (including an overview of BoLD’s economics, spam prevention, rewards, reimbursements and penalties) and its proposed design for Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova.\n\n## Constitutional Proposal\n\n## Abstract\n\nThis Constitutional AIP proposes upgrading Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova’s Rollup Contracts to use Arbitrum BoLD and to support a new challenger manager contract on Ethereum. Arbitrum BoLD is a new dispute resolution protocol that’s designed to replace the existing and currently deployed Arbitrum protocol. If the upgrade is approved, then validators on Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova can use the Nitro software to participate in BoLD. BoLD delivers two critical improvements:\n- Unlocks permissionless validation for Arbitrum chains,\n- Enhances the security of Arbitrum chains by mitigating the risk of [delay attacks](https://medium.com/offchainlabs/solutions-to-delay-attacks-on-rollups-434f9d05a07a).\n\nBoLD accomplishes this feat by ensuring that any single honest party can always successfully defend against malicious claims to an Arbitrum chain’s state. BoLD represents the next step on the journey to having the Arbitrum technology stack being recognized as a [Stage 2 Ethereum rollup](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/proposed-milestones-for-rollups-taking-off-training-wheels/11571). The implementation of BoLD will be thoroughly tested to ensure both its effectiveness and safety. The testing plan includes:\n- A comprehensive [audit by Trail of Bits](https://github.com/trailofbits/publications/blob/master/reviews/2024-04-offchainbold-securityreview.pdf),\n- Deployment of the protocol to public testnets for at least 8 weeks,\n- A public [audit program](https://code4rena.com/audits/2024-05-arbitrum-bold),\n- [Publication of mathematical safety proofs and formal specifications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10491).\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe ArbitrumDAO should consider approving this AIP as BoLD delivers critical security and decentralization improvements for Arbitrum One and Nova that benefit all Arbitrum users, Arbitrum node operators, dApps on Arbitrum, and Arbitrum bridges. These benefits can be extended to any Orbit chain that wishes to adopt BoLD.\n\nMore specifically, this new dispute resolution protocol brings the following benefits to Arbitrum chains:\n- Permissionless validation\n- Fixed delay time for assertion confirmation\n- Security Council Safety-First Approach\n\nMore details on these benefits can be found in the [Motivation section of the original proposal](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-bold-permissionless-validation-for-arbitrum/23232#motivation-2).\n\n## Rationale\n\nEnabling permissionless validation has been a long-term goal of Arbitrum on the [progressive journey towards decentralization](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/state-of-progressive-decentralization).\n\nBoLD mitigates the risk of delay attacks on Optimistic Rollups by ensuring challenges can be resolved within a fixed time period as long as there is an honest party involved. This particular change unlocks permissionless validation, enabling any well-resourced honest party or parties to defend and protect Arbitrum from malicious actors.\n\nMore details on the community values that this proposal supports, can be found in the [Rationale section of the original proposal](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-bold-permissionless-validation-for-arbitrum/23232#rationale-3).\n\n## Implementation, Formal Specification, and Safety Proofs\n\nThe following link, [BoLD Implementation Deep Dive](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/bold/blob/main/docs/research-specs/TechnicalDeepDive.pdf), explains how BoLD is implemented and how it works at a high level. To read about the formal specifications and mathematical safety proofs for the protocol, check out the [official BoLD whitepaper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10491).\n\n## Economics of Disputes, including the cost to participate, rewards, and penalties\n\nThe economics behind BoLD are carefully researched and designed to optimize for the security of the protocol while keeping costs reasonable for honest parties. More details on this topic can be found in the [Economics section of the original proposal](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-bold-permissionless-validation-for-arbitrum/23232#overview-of-bolds-economics-and-spam-prevention-5) and this short paper on the [Economics of Disputes in BoLD](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/bold/blob/main/docs/research-specs/Economics.pdf). \n\n## Technical Risks\n\nSome of the technical risks of the BoLD upgrade include:\n- Issues preventing liveness of challenges due to smart contract bugs in the new contracts. For instance, no honest validator able to make a move when it should be able to;\n- Safety issues where a malicious party is able to game the system and win due to logic errors in smart contracts;\n- Logic bugs in the assertion smart contracts that could affect assertion confirmation and posting, which could delay withdrawals until it is fixed; and\n- Bugs in bonding logic in the smart contracts that could lead to loss of funds due to logic errors in the Arbitrum Rollup and challenge manager smart contracts.\n\nRisks that remain the same between the current Arbitrum Rollup protocol and BoLD:\n- Bugs in the one step proof logic: BoLD does not change how one step proofs work for Arbitrum chains.\n\n## Timeline and steps to implement BoLD for Arbitrum One and Nova\n\nBelow is a list of initiatives to ensure the new BoLD dispute resolution protocol is ready to be reviewed and voted on by the ArbitrumDAO for adoption in Arbitrum One and Nova. Feedback from the community and any findings from testing will be collected and used to inform decisions and evolve BoLD along the way.\n\n1. Deployment of a public testnet with BoLD validators for a minimum of 4 weeks\n  a. Check out this guide on [how to deploy a BoLD validator on the testnet](https://github.com/offchainlabs/bold-validator-starter-kit) to begin testing out permissionless validation using Arbitrum technology!\n2. The submission of the AIP in the format of a [forum post](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-bold-permissionless-validation-for-arbitrum/23232).\n3. [Audit of the protocol’s implementation by Trail of Bits](https://github.com/trailofbits/publications/blob/master/reviews/2024-04-offchainbold-securityreview.pdf)\n4. Hosting of governance calls to talk about BoLD to answer questions from the community about BoLD and this AIP.\n5. This formal temperature check proposal to activate BoLD on Arbitrum’s Sepolia for a minimum of 4 weeks, be made via a Snapshot vote.\n6. Kick-start a [public audit program](https://code4rena.com/audits/2024-05-arbitrum-bold).\n7. Finalize pre-mainnet requirements, including:\n  a. Publication of BoLD migration documentation for existing validators;\n  b. Deployment of a monitoring stack to view on-going challenges on an Arbitrum chain; and\n  c. Publication of a formal procedure for The Arbitrum Foundation to handle L1 gas costs reimbursements for honest parties.\n8. Formal AIP gets submitted to Tally.\n9. Should the formal on-chain proposal pass, BoLD will activate on Arbitrum One and Nova.\n\n## Overall Cost\n\nThere is no cost for this proposal to the ArbitrumDAO as Offchain Labs, Inc. will incur all engineering and audit costs to complete the implementation of BoLD and get this new dispute resolution protocol into a mainnet-ready state. Currently, future development work for BoLD is expected to also be undertaken by Offchain Labs, Inc.\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThe confirmation timing on any withdrawal that is in-flight when the proposed BoLD upgrade is activated will be delayed until the first BoLD assertion is confirmed. This means that for any Arbitrum chain that upgrades to use BoLD, including Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova, all pending withdrawals to L1 Ethereum that were initiated before the upgrade will be delayed by 1 challenge period, plus the time between the withdrawal was initiated and the time that the BoLD upgrade takes place. This is because the upgrade effectively “resets” the challenge period for that are not yet finalized.\n\n## FAQ\n\nFor additional topics & questions, please visit the BoLD specific FAQ document [here](https://www.notion.so/arbitrumfoundation/Arbitrum-BoLD-FAQ-93210f430a6a470792496be040ac9990).",

        "body": "Category: Constitutional - Process\nAs part of its governance, the Arbitrum DAO incorporates a Security Council that can take certain emergency and non-emergency actions:\n\nSection 3 of the Constitution 10 describes this council in more detail.\nInitial Setup Transparency Report 3 details the current members of the council.\nSection 4 on the Constitution outlines an election process that will replace six security council members every six months.\nThe first election to replace the first cohort of Security Council Members is expected to begin on the 15th September.\n\nExecutive summary\nThis vote relates to the enactment of the Arbitrum Security Council elections.\nA smart contract system has been developed to enable on-chain voting. That system is final and under multiple security audits.\nThis vote is meant to temperature check with the DAO both the process that will be conducted for the elections, as well as the smart contract system that will enable them.\nA successful vote will lead to an on-chain proposal that updates the constitution text with the new sections below, as well as the new Security Council election system being activated within the broader Arbitrum governance architecture.\nImplementation Status\nThe code representing the proposed architecture is currently under audit and is available for full review in: GitHub - ArbitrumFoundation/governance at c18de53820c505fc459f766c1b224810eaeaabc5.\n\nThe work has already been audited by Trail of Bits and the identified issues have been patched in, the full audit report will be made available in the codebase soon. A Code4Rena audit competition has also been commissioned for the election system and can be viewed at Code4rena | Keeping high severity bugs out of production\n\nBackground\nAn overview of the election process as described by the Constitution alongside the process for how to enact a code change to Arbitrum’s smart contract suite:\n\nConstitution of the Arbitrum DAO 2 (esp. sections 3 10 and 4) - As noted above, this proposal seeks to enact what is already described in the Constitution.\nDAO Governance Architecture 5 - The proposed architecture makes use of a number of existing governance components.\nAn understanding of the following smart contract suites will help the reader evaluate this proposal as it re-uses several components:\n\nOpen Zeppelin Governor - The proposed architecture inherits a number of OpenZeppelin contracts.\nGnosis Modules 1 - Each of the security councils is a Gnosis Safe, and updating members of the security council is handled via adding Gnosis modules.\nHigh-level Election Overview\nThe Constitution specifies that membership of the Security Council is split into two cohorts. Every 6 months, all positions in a single cohort are put up for election.\n\nThe proposed election implementation, which must adhere to the specification laid out in the Constitution, is split into:\n\nElection stages: The process for selecting and voting for nominees.\nUpdate stages: Installing the newly elected cohort into the Arbitrum smart contracts.\nThe election process and update stages are performed via on-chain smart contracts. A brief overview of each stage includes:\n\nElection Stages\nProcess for selecting and voting for the new cohort of Security council members.\n\nNominee selection (7 days). Candidates must gain 0.2% of total votable tokens in order to make it to the next step.\nCompliance check by Foundation (14 days). As dictated in the Constitution, the selected nominees must undergo a compliance check to ensure they comply with the legal requirements, service agreements, and additional rules dictated by the Constitution.\nMember election (21 days). Votes are cast and the top 6 nominees are selected.\nUpdate Stages\nProcess to install the newly elected cohort of Security Council members into the Arbitrum smart contracts.\n\nSecurity Council manager update (0 days). The manager is the source of truth for specifying who are the current council members. It processes the election result and takes note on who will be the new security council members.\nL2 timelock + withdrawal + L1 timelock (3 + 7 + 3 days). All actions that directly affect the core Arbitrum contracts must go through a series of timelocks to protect the right for all users to exit. This is a built-in safety mechanism for users who are unhappy with the approved changes.\nIndividual council update (0 days). Once the updates have passed through the relevant timelocks, the Security Council manager can install the security council members. This requires updating 4 Gnosis Safe smart contracts that are controlled by the Security Council members.\nSecurity Council Election Flow\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreia2bk2mmknletnshsvxbohkbszppbkb3wdntpnraj7x2gwgx2rgqq)\n    \nElection Stages in detail\n1. Nominee selection (7 days)\nThis stage consists of handling election timing, candidate registration, candidate endorsement:\n\nElection creation. Elections can be created by anyone, but only every 6 months. The election alternates between targeting the positions on the two cohorts. Once created, this first stage of the election process lasts for 7 days.\nCandidate registration. During these 7 days, any candidate can register, unless they are already a member of the other cohort. Members of the current cohort (the cohort up for election) are allowed to register for re-election.\nEndorsing candidates. Delegates can endorse a candidate during this 7 day window. A single delegate can split their vote across multiple candidates. No candidate can accrue more than 0.2% of all votable tokens.\nFallback in case of too few candidates. In the event that fewer than 6 candidates receive a 0.2% endorsement, outgoing members of the cohort up for election will be selected to make up to 6 candidates.\nImplementation details\nThe nominee selection process is implemented by the SecurityCouncilNomineeElectionGovernor contract.\n\nIt inherits most of its functionality from the Open Zeppelin Governor contracts and we have extended it with an extra feature:\n\nCustom counting module to allow delegates to endorse multiple candidates.\nThe governor contract has the following characteristics:\n\nA new proposal is created each election cycle, with an identifier unique to that election cycle.\nCandidates can the put themselves forward by calling addContender.\nDelegates can call castVoteWithReasonAndParams, supplying custom arguments in the params to indicate which candidate they wish to endorse with what weight.\n2. Compliance check by the Foundation(14 days)\nThe Foundation will be given 14 days to vet the prospective nominees. If they find that a candidate does not meet the compliance check, they can exclude the candidate from progressing to the next stage. Note that grounds for exclusion could include greater than 3 members of a given organisation being represented in the nominee set (as described in section 4 of the Constitution).\n\nImplementation details\nThe foundation can exclude a nominee by:\n\nCalling a custom excludeNominee function on the same SecurityCouncilNomineeElectionGovernor contract.\nThe Governor smart contract enforces the 2 week time period and the Foundation must exclude nominees by this deadline.\n\nOnce the compliance check has completed:\n\nAnyone can call the execute function on the SecurityCouncilNomineeElectionGovernor to proceed to the member election stage.\nIf there are less than 6 eligible nominees, then the Foundation will consult with outgoing members of the cohort on whether they will continue in this role for another 12 months. Members of the existing cohort may be selected at random to fill the remaining seats.\n\n3. Member election (21 days)\nThe voting process can begin once a set of compliant candidates have been successfully nominated.\n\nThe voting process is designed to encourage voters to cast their vote early. Their voting power will eventually decay if they do not cast their vote within the first 7 days:\n\n0 - 7 days. Votes cast will carry weight 1 per token\n7 - 21 days. Votes cast will have their weight linearly decreased based on the amount of time that has passed since the 7 day point. By the 21st day, each token will carry a weight of 0.\nAdditionally, delegates can cast votes for more than one nominee:\n\nSplit voting. delegates can split their tokens across multiple nominees, with 1 token representing 1 vote.\nImplementation details\nThe Security Council member election will take place in a separate SecurityCouncilMemberElectionGovernor contract which will also inherit from Open Zeppelin Governor contracts.\n\nAfter the 14 day waiting period for the compliance check, anyone can trigger a new member election:\n\nCall the execute function in SecurityCouncilNomineeElectionGovernor to deploy a new election proposal for SecurityCouncilMemberElectionGovernor\nThe SecurityCouncilMemberElectionGovernor includes:\n\nA custom counting module that allows delegates to split their vote and accounts for the linear decrease in voting weight.\nThese additional parameters are supplied as the params argument when calling castVoteWithReasonAndParams.\nThe custom counting module also checks that the nominee being voted is a compliant one by checking against the compliant nominee list in the SecurityCouncilNomineeElectionGovernor.\nAt the end of the 21 days of election:\n\nAnyone can call the execute function on the SecurityCouncilMemberElectionGovernor contract to initiate the update of top 6 nominees with the most votes into SecurityCouncilManager.\nUpdate stages in detail\n1. Security Council manager update\nThe security council manager is a contract which contains the canonical list of security council members, and which cohort they are part of. When a member election completes, the manager updates its local list of the current cohorts then forms cross chain messages to propagate those updates to each of the Security Council Gnosis safes.\n\nThe manager also provides some additional functionality to allow the security council to:\n\nRemove a member: As described in the Constitution, the council can remove one of its own members. The DAO can also remove a member under special conditions described by the Constitution.\nAdd a member: After removing a member, the council can add a member\nAddress rotation: As a practical matter, a council member can rotate one of their own keys. This can only be done with the approval of at least 9/12 council members as well as explicit approval from the member carrying out the rotation.\nImplementation details\nThe manager functionality is contained within a custom SecurityCouncilManager smart contract. Since the SecurityCouncilManager is indirectly able to make calls to the standard UpgradeExecutor contracts which have far reaching powers, special care must be take to ensure the manager only makes council member updates.\n\nCalling the UpgradeExecutors on each of the chains requires navigating withdrawals transactions, timelocks and inboxes, the SecurityCouncilManager outsources the calldata creation for these routes to a UpgradeExecRouteBuilder contract.\n\n2. Timelocks and withdrawal\nConstitutional DAO proposals all pass through:\n\nL2 timelock (3 days),\nL2 → L1 withdrawal (~7 days),\nL1 timelock (3 days).\nYou can read more about these stages in the governance docs 1. The purpose of these delays is to ensure that users wishing to withdraw their assets before the proposal is executed will have the time to do so. Changing the Security Council members should also provide this guarantee, so after the election has completed and before the Security Councils are updated the update message also goes through these same stages. The update message will use the existing timelocks to enforce these delays.\n\nImplementation details\nThe existing governance timelock contracts are used as part of this flow.\n\nThe SecurityCouncilManager is given the PROPOSER role on the L2 timelock enabling it to create messages that will eventually be received by each UpgradeExecutor.\n\n3. Individual council updates\nThe new Security Council members need to be installed into 4 Gnosis safes:\n\nArbitrum One 9 of 12 Emergency Security Council\nArbitrum One 7 of 12 Non-Emergency Security Council\nEthereum 9 of 12 Emergency Security Council\nNova 9 of 12 Emergency Security Council\nThe old cohort of members will be removed, and the new cohort will replace them.\n\nImplementation details\nTo do this the existing Upgrade Executor contracts on each chain will be installed as Gnosis Safe modules into the Security Council safes. A custom Governance Action Contract 2 will be used to call the specific OwnerManager addOwnerWithThreshold and removeOwner methods on the Gnosis safes.\n\nAdditional affordances\nThe Constitution also declares some other additional affordances to certain parties\n\nThe DAO can vote to remove a member prior to the end of their term, as long as 10% of possible votes are cast in favour and 5/6 of cast votes are in favour. This will be implemented as a governor with correct quorum and proposal passed thresholds. This governor will be given the rights to call removeMember on the SecurityCouncilManager.\nThe Security Council can remove a member prior to the end of their term, if 9 of 12 members agree. The 9 of 12 council will be given the rights to call removeMember on the SecurityCouncilManager.\nThe Security Council can add a member once one has been removed, if 9 of 12 members agree and if there are less than 12 members currently on the council. The 9 of 12 council will be given the rights to call addMember on the SecurityCouncilManager.\nConstitution Updates\nThe proposed implementation mostly satisfies the specification outlined by the Arbitrum Constitution. There are some minor changes that are required to the Constitution’s text to take into account the time it takes to install new candidates and to support compliance procedures set out by the Arbitrum Foundation.\n\nNote, the final wording for how to update the Constitution will be provided in a later revision. We simply want to notify the requirement that the text needs to be changed. At this stage, our request for feedback is focused on the implementation details of the smart contract suite.\n\nUpdate timeline for the election\nThe Section 4 of the Constitution contains the text:\n\nFrom T until T+7 days: Any DAO member may declare their candidacy for the Security Council; provided that a current Security Council member in one cohort may not be a candidate for a seat in the other cohort. To the extent that there are more than six candidates, each eligible candidate must be supported by pledged votes representing at least 0.2% of all Votable Tokens. In the event that fewer than six candidates are supported by pledged votes representing at least 0.2% of all Votable Tokens, the current Security Council members whose seats are up for election may become candidates (as randomly selected out of their Cohort) until there are 6 candidates.\n\nFrom T+7 days until T+28 days: Each DAO member or delegate may vote for any declared candidate. Each token may be cast for one candidate. Votes cast before T+14 days will have 100% weight. Votes cast between T+14 days and T+28 days will have weight based on the time of casting, decreasing linearly with time, with 100% weight at T+14 days, decreasing linearly to 0% weight at T+28 days.\n\nAt T+28 days: The 6 candidates who have received the most votes are elected and immediately join the Council, replacing the Cohort that was up for re-election.\n\nWe need to make three changes to the Arbitrum Constitution:\n\nNew timeline. A dedicated compliance process must be included between the nominee selection and member election phases. This will shift the timeline of events and the total election will now last at least 42 days alongside additional time to install the newly elected Security Council members via the on-chain governance smart contracts.\nLess than 6 eligible nominees. The Arbitrum Foundation has the authority to add new nominees during the Compliance stage if there are less than 6 eligible nominees.\nInstallation time. We need to remove the phrase ‘immediately join the Council’ to take into account the on-chain governance process for installing the newly elected candidates. For example, the various time locks to protect a user’s right to exit Arbitrum during the upgrade and the time it takes to send an L2 → L1 message.\nWith the above in mind, we propose an update to Section 4 of the Constitution with the following text:\n\nNominee selection (T until T+7 days): Any DAO member may declare their candidacy for the Security Council; provided that a current Security Council member in one cohort may not be a candidate for a seat in the other cohort. To the extent that there are more than six candidates, each eligible candidate must be supported by pledged votes representing at least 0.2% of all Votable Tokens.\n\nCompliance process (T+7 until T+21 days): All candidates will cooperate with The Arbitrum Foundation and complete the compliance process. The Arbitrum Foundation is responsible for removing any candidates that fail the compliance process. In the event that fewer than six candidates are supported by pledged votes representing at least 0.2% of all Votable Tokens, the current Security Council members whose seats are up for election may become candidates (as randomly selected out of their Cohort) until there are 6 candidates.\n\nMember election (T+21 until T+42 days): Each DAO member or delegate may vote for any declared candidate. Each token may be cast for one candidate. Votes cast before T+28 days will have 100% weight. Votes cast between T+28 days and T+42 days will have weight based on the time of casting, decreasing linearly with time, with 100% weight at T+28 days, decreasing linearly to 0% weight at T+42 days.\n\nAt T+42 days: The process for replacing the cohort of Security Council members with the 6 candidates who received the most votes will be activated. The installation process must be executed via the on-chain governance smart contracts and it may take several days until the new Security Council members are installed.\n\n\nWe propose to update the Constitution with the following text:\n\nThe Arbitrum Foundation is allocated 14 days for the Compliance process and it should be executed between the Nominee selection and Member election. The Arbitrum Foundation has flexibility to update its compliance policy for every new election. This is required to allow The Arbitrum Foundation to comply with Cayman Island laws. Furthermore, The Arbitrum Foundation maintains the right to issue new procedures and guidelines for off-chain components of the Security Council election. All efforts should be made by The Arbitrum Foundation to ensure an orderly, fair, and transparent election.\nFinal update to the Constitution text.\nFor completeness, the amended text for Section 4 of the Arbitrum Constitution, including the changes from AIP-4:\n\nThe Security Council has 12 members, who are divided into two Cohorts of 6 members.\n\nThe initial Security Council Cohorts were determined by randomly splitting the 12 members into two 6-member cohorts - 6 members in the ‘First Cohort’ and 6 members in the ‘Second Cohort’. The members of the initial Security Council Cohorts are detailed in a transparency report  linked in the discussion",

        "body": "## Non-Constitutional Proposal\n\n## Abstract\n\nThe Arbitrum Foundation is seeking 4,234 ETH, for **Assertion and challenge bonds** - to allow the Arbitrum Foundation to run a BoLD validator and fulfill the role of being the first, but not necessarily the only, honest and active proposer.\n\nThis proposal is contingent on the AIP [upgrade the DAO-governed chains to use BoLD](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-bold-permissionless-validation-for-arbitrum/23232) being approved by the ArbitrumDAO. If the AIP to upgrade the DAO-governed chains to use BoLD does not pass - then the Arbitrum Foundation will return these funds, to the ArbitrumDAO within 30 days.\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe AIP to upgrade the DAO-governed chains to use BoLD only proposes the technical upgrade and intentionally does not yet introduce an economic incentive mechanism to grow the validator set (since Arbitrum only needs 1 honest, active proposer at any point in time). Without this incentive, the ArbitrumDAO holds the risk that no entity will fulfill the role of being the first honest party to secure Arbitrum One. By adopting this proposal, the ArbitrumDAO is appointing the Arbitrum Foundation to be the first active proposer for Arbitrum One.\n\n## Key Terms\n\n- **Active proposer**. A proposer who is actively posting assertions and helping advance the chain. Validators are not considered active proposers until they successfully propose an assertion with a bond. In order to become an active proposer for Arbitrum One, post-BoLD, a validator has to propose an L2 state assertion to Ethereum. If they do not have an active bond on L1, they then need to attach a bond to their assertion in order to successfully post the assertion. Subsequent assertions posted by the same address will simply move the already-supplied bond to their latest proposed assertion. Meanwhile, if an entity, say Bob, has posted a successor assertion to one previously made by another entity, Alice, then Bob would be considered by the protocol to be the current active proposer. Alice would no longer be considered by the protocol as the active proposer and once Alice’s assertion is confirmed, then Alice gets her assertion bond refunded. There can only be 1 “active” proposer at any point.\n- **Assertion**. A claim posted to the Arbitrum rollup contracts on Ethereum L1 about the Arbitrum L2 execution state. Each claim consumes messages from the Arbitrum rollup inbox contract that are ordered by the Sequencer.\n- **Assertion bond**. Creating an assertion in the rollup contracts requires the proposer to join the validator set by putting up a bond, in the form of 3,600 ETH. Subsequent assertions posted by the same party do not require more bonds, instead, the protocol always considers validators to be bonded to their latest posted assertion until they withdraw.\n- **Challenge bond**. The challenge process in BoLD requires a proposer to post a bond whenever they want to challenge a malicious (and invalid) assertion from a dishonest proposer. This applies to the block level, big-step sub-challenge, and one-step sub-challenge levels, as part of the interactive dispute game played between challengers.\n- **One honest party**. In BoLD, a single, honest party can protect the integrity and liveness of the system. While only a single party is required to act, it is still an open and permissionless system, allowing anyone to step up at any time.\n- **Proposer**. An agent who looks up the list of ordered transactions, executes them off-chain, and then proposes a claim on the final execution output by posting an assertion on-chain. A proposer *must* have a bond deposited into the BoLD rollup contracts on Ethereum to be considered eligible, by the protocol, to post assertions.\n- **Service fee**. A fee for proposers who are actively and successfully posting on-chain assertions which should amount to the same income that Ethereum validators receive over the same time period. The fee is paid for every on-chain assertion posted by the proposer once their assertion is confirmed. This fee removes the disincentive to lock up capital and be a proposer for the protocol and should not be viewed as an incentive or reward.\n\n## Budget Request\n\n### Assertion and Challenge Bonds\n\nThe Foundation is requesting 4,234 ETH from the ArbitrumDAO treasury to cover the bonds required to establish a single honest proposer with the capability to defend the system.\n\nThe requested ETH is a combination of:\n- 3600 ETH required to post an assertion bond, and;\n- Subsequent 555 ETH + 79 ETH for challenge bonds for one challenge.\n\nThe Arbitrum Foundation will deposit these funds in the [RollupCore.sol] contracts on L1 Ethereum for the validator. If the [BoLD AIP](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-bold-permissionless-validation-for-arbitrum/23232) passes, then the Arbitrum Foundation’s staked validator will be enabled to immediately act as a proposer for Arbitrum One.\n\nNote: the Arbitrum Foundation is proposing to be the first active proposer, not the ONLY proposer. BoLD removes the reliance on a permissioned set of validators who are eligible to be proposers, and any interested parties and/or teams can permissionlessly run validators to become proposers for Arbitrum One upon a successful upgrade of the dispute protocol.\n\n## Steps to implement & timeline\n\n1. Publication of an AIP to the ArbitrumDAO forums for engaged discussion and debate.\n2. Temperature checks on Snapshot.\n  a. Bond sentiment. Test whether the ArbitrumDAO may approve the Arbitrum Foundation’s request for 4234 ETH to run the first BoLD validator.\n  b. Operational cost sentiment. Test whether the ArbitrumDAO may approve the additional service fee for active proposers (excluding the Arbitrum Foundation) and the reimbursement of L1 gas costs for running an active proposer, totalling 900 ETH.\n3. Depending on the temperature check result:\n  a. Continue to Tally. If there is strong consensus on both temperature checks, then the AIP will be published as one on-chain AIP on Tally for an on-chain vote.\n  b. Re-iterate on numbers. If either temperature check is rejected by the DAO, then it will be iterated on and re-submitted for a temperature check again, until there is consensus.\n4. Assuming a successful vote on-chain, the funds will be transferred to a multi-sig wallet controlled by the Arbitrum Foundation.\n5. The Arbitrum Foundation will then deposit the funds in a validator that will be used to secure Arbitrum One, if the AIP to upgrade the DAO-governed chains to use BoLD is passed.\n\n## Payment facilitation, final costs & restrictions\n\nThe Arbitrum Foundation is requesting 4,234 ETH from the ArbitrumDAO to cover the following costs:\n- 3600 ETH to run the first BoLD-enabled proposer for Arbitrum One, and\n- 634 (555 + 79) ETH budget to counter one BoLD challenge.\n\nAll requested funds will be sent to a multi-sig controlled by the Arbitrum Foundation and the funds will be returned if the BoLD proposal is not approved by the ArbitrumDAO.\n\nThe ArbitrumDAO will have the authority to single-handedly return the funds to the ArbitrumDAO treasury by revoking the Arbitrum Foundation’s proposer at any time and returning the bonds back to the treasury. This will be implemented and enforced via the BoLD smart contracts:\n- **Withdrawal Address**. The funds will be deposited into BoLD from the Arbitrum Foundation-controlled multi-sig address but the withdrawal address will be set to the ‘UpgradeExecutor’ contract on L1.\n- **Triggering Withdrawal**. The ArbitrumDAO (via governance) or the Arbitrum Foundation will have the authority to trigger a withdrawal and the funds can only be sent to the pre-established withdrawal address (i.e. the ArbitrumDAO’s treasury).",

A fee for proposers who are actively and successfully posting on-chain assertions which should amount to the same income that Ethereum validators receive over the same time period. This fee removes the disincentive to lock up capital and be a proposer for the protocol and should not be viewed as an incentive or reward.\n\n## Budget Request\n\n### Service Fees for BoLD Validators\n\nAll blockchains, including Arbitrum One, should compensate participants who actively work to progress the chain.\n\nFor Arbitrum One, the [BoLD AIP](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-bold-permissionless-validation-for-arbitrum/23232) proposes that the DAO pay a service fee to an active proposer who is advancing the chain by posting assertions. If approved, the service fee will correlate to the same annualized income earned by a validator on Ethereum mainnet, which at the time of writing is approximately 3% to 4% of the staked ETH per year ([Composite Ether Staking Rate benchmark by CoinDesk Indices](https://www.coindesk.com/indices/ether/cesr)). \n\nNOTE: This payment is a fee and not a reward. In both the currently deployed protocol and in BoLD, a new assertion is posted every hour and only the time that the proposer is considered actively bonded will be used to determine the fee amount. Additionally, proposers are only eligible for this fee when their assertion is confirmed. There can be multiple actors who deposit the required assertion bond and run a proposer, but the fee will only be paid to the proposer whose assertion is the first to be accepted on L1 (i.e. active).\n\nWe estimate the following service fee per year:\n- Assuming a 4% service fee based on the 3600 ETH bond size, equates to a maximum of 144 ETH per year per active proposer (at this assumed rate).\n\nThe Foundation therefore requests 500 ETH to support service fee payments for up to 3 years (144*3 years plus a buffer of 68 ETH) in the event that an active proposer, who is not the Arbitrum Foundation, steps up to advance the chain. \n\nTo learn more about service fees, check out the [forum post](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-bold-permissionless-validation-for-arbitrum/23232#service-fee-for-active-proposers-7).\n\nNote: The Arbitrum Foundation will NOT be entitled to receive the service fee since the Arbitrum Foundation is proposing to use the ArbitrumDAO’s funds.\n\n### Reimbursement of L1 Gas Costs\n\nThe Foundation is requesting 400 ETH to reimburse the on-chain gas costs for active (and honest) proposers who are helping advance and defend the Arbitrum chain. It is estimated that 400 ETH will be sufficient to cover ~3 years of operational costs.\n\nThere are two on-chain gas costs:\n- **Posting assertions**. An active proposer must post an assertion for the chain to advance.\n- **Challenges**. A proposer who is defending the system must participate in a multi-round challenge process.\n\nNote: we only propose to reimburse L1 gas costs since that is publicly verifiable and computable by all. The off-chain costs to run a proposer will not be reimbursed.\n\n#### Estimated Reimbursement Costs\n\nAssuming a nominal gas price of 50 gwei/gas during normal operations (i.e. no challenges) and assuming an elevated 500 gwei/gas price during a challenge (i.e. worst-case scenario), to fully reimburse an honest party’s gas costs the Arbitrum Foundation is requesting 400 ETH for 3 years.\n\nThis includes ~308 ETH to cover the above costs and a ~92 ETH buffer in the event of higher gas prices during normal operations, during a challenge, and/or in the event that there is more than one challenge per year.\n\nTo learn more about these calculations, check out the [forum post](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-funds-to-bootstrap-the-first-bold-validator/24506#reimbursement-of-l1-gas-costs-7).\n\n## Steps to implement & timeline\n\n1. Publication of an AIP to the ArbitrumDAO forums for engaged discussion and debate.\n2. Two separate temperature checks on Snapshot.\n  a. Bond sentiment. Test whether the ArbitrumDAO may approve the Arbitrum Foundation’s request for 4234 ETH to run the first BoLD validator.\n  b. Operational cost sentiment. Test whether the ArbitrumDAO may approve the additional service fee for active proposers (excluding the Arbitrum Foundation) and the reimbursement of L1 gas costs for running an active proposer, totalling 900 ETH.\n3. Depending on the temperature check result:\n  a. Continue to Tally. If there is strong consensus on both temperature checks, then the AIP will be published as one on-chain AIP on Tally for an on-chain vote.\n  b. Re-iterate on numbers. If either temperature check is rejected by the DAO, then it will be iterated on and re-submitted for a temperature check again, until these is consensus.\n4. Assuming a successful vote on-chain, the funds will be transferred to a multi-sig wallet controlled by the Arbitrum Foundation.\n5. The Arbitrum Foundation will then deposit the funds in a validator that will be used to secure Arbitrum One, if the AIP to upgrade the DAO-governed chains to use BoLD is passed.\n\n## Payment facilitation, final costs & restrictions\n\nThe Arbitrum Foundation is requesting 900 ETH from the ArbitrumDAO to cover the following costs:\n- 500 ETH as service fees for active BoLD proposers (excluding the Arbitrum Foundation), and,\n- 400 ETH to reimburse honest parties on their L1 gas costs for 3 years.\n\nNotable points:\n- Arbitrum Foundation will not be entitled to the service fee,\n- Arbitrum Foundation will be reimbursed for the L1 gas costs,\n- All service fee payments and L1 gas reimbursements for non-Arbitrum Foundation actors will be manually processed by the Arbitrum Foundation periodically alongside a requirement that all payments adhere to the Foundation’s compliance process.\n\nAll requested funds will be sent to a multi-sig controlled by the Arbitrum Foundation and the funds will be returned if the BoLD proposal is not approved by the ArbitrumDAO. Additionally, after 3 years, any unspent funds from the service fee or gas reimbursements will be returned to the ArbitrumDAO and a subsequent proposal will be posted to help cover the future operational costs of Arbitrum.\n\nThe ArbitrumDAO will have the authority to single-handedly return the funds to the ArbitrumDAO treasury by revoking the Arbitrum Foundation’s proposer at any time and returning the bonds back to the treasury. This will be implemented and enforced via the BoLD smart contracts:\n- **Withdrawal Address**. The funds will be deposited into BoLD from the Arbitrum Foundation-controlled multi-sig address but the withdrawal address will be set to the ‘UpgradeExecutor’ contract on L1.\n- **Triggering Withdrawal**. The ArbitrumDAO (via governance) or the Arbitrum Foundation will have the authority to trigger a withdrawal and the funds can only be sent to the pre-established withdrawal address (i.e. the ArbitrumDAO’s treasury).",

    "summary": "The proposal seeks to extend the L2 Core Time Lock delay from 3 days to 8 days, increasing security by giving the Security Council more time to act and users a longer exit window. This change aligns with L2Beat's recommendations and moves Arbitrum closer to Stage 2 rollup status. The forum sentiment strongly supports the proposal with minimal opposition, reflecting a consensus for enhanced security despite the longer delay.",

      "Increases security by allowing more time for the Security Council to intervene on malicious proposals.",
      "Provides users a longer exit window (from 3 to 8 days) to withdraw assets if concerned about governance changes.",
      "Improves Arbitrum's status on L2Beat, changing the exit window rating from red to yellow, signaling maturity.",
      "Does not impact treasury spending proposals, only constitutional upgrades, so most operations remain unaffected.",

      "Extends the time for constitutional proposals to be enacted, potentially delaying urgent upgrades.",
      "Some concerns about whether 8 days is the optimal delay and the need for defining emergency scenarios for faster action.",
