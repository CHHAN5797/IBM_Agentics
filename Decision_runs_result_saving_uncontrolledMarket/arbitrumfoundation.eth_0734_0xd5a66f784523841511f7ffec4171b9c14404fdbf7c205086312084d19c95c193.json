        "body": "Note: this proposal will be subject to an individual Snapshot vote; if it reaches a quorum of 3% of votable $ARB, it may be combined with several other maintenance-related proposals for a joint Tally vote.\n\n# Abstract\n\nThis proposal seeks approval to replace the Upgrade Executor contracts on Arbitrum One, Arbitrum Nova, and Ethereum mainnet with upgraded versions. The modernized version introduces an additional function that enables the Upgrade Executor to execute an upgrade by directly calling the target contract, rather than indirectly delegate calling an upgrade contract. As a result, future governance actions can be executed more simply and with fewer contract deployments.\n\n# Motivation\n\nThe Upgrade Executors controlled by the DAO are responsible for carrying out critical upgrades on [Arbitrum One](https://arbiscan.io/address/0xcf57572261c7c2bcf21ffd220ea7d1a27d40a827#code), [Arbitrum Nova](https://nova.arbiscan.io/address/0x86a02dd71363c440b21f4c0e5b2ad01ffe1a7482), and [Ethereum](https://etherscan.io/address/0x3fffbadaf827559da092217e474760e2b2c3cedd#code) such as protocol contract upgrades, system parameter changes, and more. Currently, the traditional Upgrade Executor contracts in place only support one function for executing an upgrade: [execute()](https://arbiscan.io/address/0xcf57572261c7c2bcf21ffd220ea7d1a27d40a827#writeProxyContract#F1). When called by the owner of the Upgrade Executor, the execute() function delegate calls an upgrade contract, which facilitates subsequent calls to target contracts and ultimately executes the upgrade. This indirect method of calling and execution can complicate upgrades and require additional development and deployments.\n\nThe modern version of the Upgrade Executor introduces a new function, [executeCall()](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/upgrade-executor/blob/eaa9d607464abb8683a3fe526acbf6d877f924e0/src/UpgradeExecutor.sol#L73), which allows the Upgrade Executor to directly call target contracts and execute upgrades, removing the need for delegate calls to upgrade contracts. While the existing execute() call is still supported, the new executeCall() function enables the Upgrade Executor to implement upgrades in a lighter weight fashion. In the future, upgrades that use this method may not require dedicated action contracts, simplifying the process and saving development energy.\n\n# Key Terms\n\n* Upgrade Executor: A smart contract responsible for executing upgrades on Arbitrum One, Arbitrum Nova, and Ethereum mainnet; owned and administered by the DAO\n* Upgrade Contract: A smart contract that contains dedicated logic for a particular upgrade; receives a call from the Upgrade Executor and subsequently calls other contracts targeted in that upgrade\n* execute(): The sole function for executing an upgrade in existing Upgrade Executor implementations; relies on indirect delegate calls to upgrade contracts\n* executeCall(): A [new function](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/upgrade-executor/blob/eaa9d607464abb8683a3fe526acbf6d877f924e0/src/UpgradeExecutor.sol#L73) for executing an upgrade in the modern Upgrade Executor implementation; allows for direct calls to target contracts\n\n# Specifications\n\n* Deploy the latest [UpgradeExecutor](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/upgrade-executor/blob/main/src/UpgradeExecutor.sol) contract on each network\n* Update proxy contracts on each network to reflect new UpgradeExecutor addresses:\n     * Arbitrum One: [0xCF57572261c7c2BCF21ffD220ea7d1a27D40A827](https://arbiscan.io/address/0xcf57572261c7c2bcf21ffd220ea7d1a27d40a827#code)\n          * [upgradeTo](https://arbiscan.io/address/0xcf57572261c7c2bcf21ffd220ea7d1a27d40a827#writeContract#F4): 0x3d745b8815F9be5BF053858165f8aB1F58c77932\n     * Arbitrum Nova: [0x86a02dD71363c440b21F4c0E5B2Ad01Ffe1A7482](https://nova.arbiscan.io/address/0x86a02dd71363c440b21f4c0e5b2ad01ffe1a7482)\n          * [upgradeTo](https://nova.arbiscan.io/address/0x86a02dd71363c440b21f4c0e5b2ad01ffe1a7482#writeContract#F4): 0x3d745b8815F9be5BF053858165f8aB1F58c77932\n     * Ethereum: [0x3ffFbAdAF827559da092217e474760E2b2c3CeDd](https://etherscan.io/address/0x3fffbadaf827559da092217e474760e2b2c3cedd#code)\n          * [upgradeTo](https://etherscan.io/address/0x3fffbadaf827559da092217e474760e2b2c3cedd#writeContract#F4): 0x3d745b8815F9be5BF053858165f8aB1F58c77932\n\n# Steps to Implement\n\n1. Deploy new UpgradeExecutor contracts on Arbitrum One, Arbitrum Nova, and Ethereum using the parameters specified above\n2. Update proxy contracts on Arbitrum One, Arbitrum Nova, and Ethereum to point to the new UpgradeExecutor contracts\nIf this proposal passes a Snapshot vote successfully (as defined above), it will be combined with other maintenance-related proposals for a unified Tally vote and on-chain payload. The portion of the Tally payload that covers the actions described in this proposal will be shared as soon as each individual proposal passes a Snapshot vote.\n\n# Timeline\n\nThe following timeline outlines proposed milestones from initial discussions to full implementation. Adjustments may be made based on community feedback and DAO governance requirements.\n\n1. June 17th: AIP forum post outlining the proposed modifications to update the upgrade executors. Requisite code has already been written, tested, and [audited](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/governance/blob/main/audits/trail_of_bits_governance_report_1_6_2023.pdf) as of 6 January 2023\n2. July 10th: Temperature check held on Snapshot\n3. July/August: Should the temperature check pass, as specified above, it will be included in the AIP draft combining several other maintenance-related proposals for a joint Tally vote.\n4. On-chain Tally vote: Will commence once all other maintenance-related proposals have passed the respective temperature checks on Snapshot\n5. Post-on-chain Tally vote: Should the Tally vote pass, the total waiting period will be 11 days, after which the upgrade executors will be updated",

        "body": "Note: this proposal will be subject to an individual Snapshot vote; if it reaches a quorum of 3% of votable $ARB, it may be combined with several other maintenance-related proposals for a joint Tally vote.\n\n# Abstract\n\nThis proposal will remove the Amortized Cost Cap, which is expected to result in higher gas fees for users on Arbitrum Nova. This increase is necessary to ensure the long-term sustainability of the network and reduce the financial burden on the Arbitrum Foundation. Given the diminishing relevance of Nova and the evolving Layer 2 landscape, lifting this cap will prevent inefficiencies and unnecessary constraints on network operations.\n\n# Motivation\n\nArbitrum Nova was initially positioned as a cost-efficient alternative to Arbitrum One, offering 30-50x cheaper transaction fees at launch. However, several developments have significantly reduced Nova’s competitive advantage:\n\n* EIP-4844 blobs: The introduction of EIP-4844 significantly reduced the cost difference between Nova and Arbitrum One, from 30-50x to a mere 2x. This difference is negligible given the already low costs on Arbitrum One.\n* Orbit adoption: Orbit chains have become a more attractive option for teams seeking gas sponsorship and customization. Their ease of deployment has led many teams to prefer Orbit chains over Nova.\n\nGiven the now-minimal cost advantage over Arbitrum One and the rise of Orbit chains, maintaining an amortized cost cap on Nova — which currently prevents batch posters from recovering full L1 costs — is no longer justifiable. Removing the cap will stop the Arbitrum Foundation from subsidizing these subsidies and align cost recovery with actual usage.\n\n# Rationale\n\nThe continued enforcement of an amortized cost cap on Nova introduces inefficiencies that do not align with its current usage patterns and network activity. This setting limits the percentage of L1 posting costs that batch posters can recover from the chain (denominated in basis points, or bips, where 10000 = 100%). Currently, the cap prevents full cost recovery, forcing the Arbitrum Foundation to subsidize the difference. Removing the cap (i.e., setting it to 0 bips) would:\n\n* Ensure batch posters are able to recover 100% of their L1 posting costs.\n* Eliminate recurring deficits currently paid by the Arbitrum Foundation.\n* Reflect Nova’s lower strategic priority within the broader Arbitrum roadmap.\n\nHistorical data on Arbitrum Nova batch poster deficits can be seen [here](https://app.hex.tech/8bb08a30-5c58-48c4-acb0-5a0515db9db2/app/0196afd6-bf44-7001-bbb9-c429e3920ca8/latest). ​This data highlights the ongoing inefficiencies and justifies the removal of the amortized cost cap.\n\n# Key Terms\n\n* Amortized Cost Cap (setAmortizedCostCapBips): A parameter within the ArbOwner system contract that limits the percentage of Layer 1 transaction posting costs that batch posters are allowed to recover from the network. Expressed in basis points (bips), where 10000 = 100%.\n* ArbOwner Contract: A privileged precompiled contract that allows the ArbitrumDAO to configure core protocol settings, such as the amortized cost cap.\n* EIP-4844: An Ethereum Improvement Proposal introducing blob-carrying transactions. Its implementation has significantly reduced the cost disparity between Arbitrum Nova and Arbitrum One, undermining the original economic rationale for Nova’s fee model.\n* Batch poster transactions: Transactions that aggregate multiple operations and submit them as a single on-chain transaction. With the enforced fee cap, these transactions become less cost-effective under current network dynamics, contributing to operational inefficiencies.\n\n# Specifications\n\nThe DAO will execute a call to the [ArbOwner contract](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro-contracts/blob/c32af127fe6a9124316abebbf756609649ede1f5/src/precompiles/ArbOwner.sol#L129C14-L129C37) on Arbitrum Nova to set the amortizedCostCapBips value to 0, thereby allowing batch posters to recover 100% of their L1 posting costs.\n\n# Steps to Implement\n\nMore detailed information about the specific implementation will be provided closer to the date of the formal on-chain Tally vote.\n\n# Timeline\n\nThe following timeline outlines proposed milestones from initial discussions to full implementation. Adjustments may be made based on community feedback and DAO governance requirements.\n\n1. May 29th: AIP forum post outlining the proposed modification to Arbitrum Nova\n2. June 19th: Temperature check held on Snapshot\n3. July/August: Should the temperature check pass, as specified above, it will be included in the AIP draft combining several other maintenance-related proposals for a joint Tally vote.\n4. On-chain Tally vote: Will commence once all other maintenance-related proposals have passed the respective temperature checks on Snapshot.\n5. Post-on-chain Tally vote: Should the Tally vote pass, the waiting period on L2 will last 1 week after Tally vote is finalized, after which, the removal of amortized cost cap will be executed on Arbitrum Nova.\n6. Post-implementation monitoring & reporting: A public dashboard will be continuously maintained and updated with new data, from 1-month after the removal of the amortized cost cap.",

        "body": "### **Abstract**\n\nThis AIP seeks to propose changes to the structure of the security council so Arbitrum can maintain the “Stage 1” designation as per L2BEAT and not fall back to “Stage 0” designation.\n\n### **Motivation**\n\nOn December 7, [L2BEAT published an update](https://medium.com/l2beat/stages-update-security-council-requirements-4c79cea8ef52) to the security council requirements for the [Stages Framework](https://medium.com/l2beat/introducing-stages-a-framework-to-evaluate-rollups-maturity-d290bb22befe). The requirements were updated after a lot of research and feedback to make Stages more formal and precise. \n\n### **Rationale**\n\nUpgrading the security council as per the Stage 1 requirements set by L2BEAT, will help ensure Arbitrum remains decentralized, but properly secured. See ‘Specifications’ for more details.\n\n### **Key Terms**\n\n**Stages:** A framework, inspired by [Vitalik’s proposed milestones](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/proposed-milestones-for-rollups-taking-off-training-wheels/11571), that categorises rollups into three distinct stages based on their reliance on these training wheels. You can learn [more about the Stages framework here](https://medium.com/l2beat/introducing-stages-a-framework-to-evaluate-rollups-maturity-d290bb22befe).\n\n**Security Council:** A group of 12 individuals who are responsible for addressing risks to the Arbitrum ecosystem through the selective application of **e**mergency actions and non-emergency actions. Learn more in [the ArbitrumDAO Docs](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/concepts/security-council).\n\n**Timelock:** Smart contracts which implement a delay between an upgrade confirmation and execution.\n\n**Exit Window:** The actual time users have to exit the system in case of an unwanted upgrade.\n\n### **Specifications**\n\nArbitrum currently has two multisigs and they both contain the same set of members:\n\na) A 9/12 multisig with instant upgrade power \n\nb) A 7/12 multisig that can upgrade with a 3+7+3 days delay \n\nWhile the higher threshold multisig can be classified as a Security Council, the lower one is below the minimum threshold and it’s considered a simple multisig according to the Stages framework introduced above.\n\nFor normal multisigs, L2BEAT requires at least a 7 days exit window for users. The current exit window for Arbitrum is 2 days (see [this thread](https://x.com/stonecoldpat0/status/1737840485967032739?s=20) for a quick explanation).\n\nMoreover, the higher threshold multisig is supposed to stop malicious upgrades attempted by the lower threshold multisig. However, since the member set is the same, if the lower threshold agrees on something there are not enough members in the higher threshold to stop them, which means that the actual security of the upgradeability mechanism boils down to the 7/12 threshold.\n\nFor the above reason, technically, with the updated requirements for Stages, Arbitrum falls back to the Stage 0 designation. Since we know that it takes time to upgrade Arbitrum, we decided to leave the Stage 1 designation with the promise of addressing the above issues in a timely manner. This proposal is about addressing the issues and moving them to be voted on by the DAO.\n\n**Proposed Solutions**\n\n1) The **first solution** would be to remove the lower threshold (7/12) multisig entirely. This can be done in two ways:\n\n1. The contract is removed which requires an on-chain upgrade, or,\n2. The lower threshold multisig increases its threshold from 7/12 to 9/12 which requires no upgrade.\n\nIncreasing the threshold gives us the flexibility to restore a lower threshold in the future should the need arise, and it’s also a very quick and easy fix since it doesn’t require an on-chain upgrade.\n\nOn the other hand, removing the dependency on the lower threshold mutlisig for all the contracts in Arbitrum is a broad and potentially risky change. Therefore we suggest raising the threshold for the time being and revisiting the removal of all the dependencies at a later date if needed.\n\n2) The **second solution** would be to leave the lower threshold multisig as it is, but to increase the exit window to 7 days. In practice, this involves increasing the L2 timelock delay from 3 days to 8 days, since there is a 1 day max delay to force transactions on Arbitrum via L1 using the ‘DelayedInbox’. Increasing the L1 Timelock would not be very beneficial due to delay attacks on the fraud proof systems, since, even with BoLD,  the challenge period would end up being up to [16 days](https://x.com/DZack23/status/1737864854059335905?s=20).\n\n3) The **third solution**, which is not strictly required by the Stages Framework for the Stage 1 designation, is to both remove the lower threshold multisig entirely and increase the L2 Timelock delay so users have more time to exit in case of unwanted upgrades, increasing the security of the system even more.\n\n### Steps to Implement\n\nFollowing a week of discussion of this RFC, the proposal will go for a vote on Snapshot with the following 6 options (as they are or slightly adjusted), and/or any additional ones, should they arise from the discussion during the RFC phase:\n\n1. Increase the threshold from 7/12 to 9/12.\n2. Increase the L2 timelock delay from 3 days to 8 days.\n3. Increase the threshold and the L2 timelock delay.\n4. Make no changes.\n\nFollowing the temp-check, if any of the aforementioned options apart from No.4 is the most popular, the proposal will move to on-chain vote to execute the proposal.\n\n### **Overall Cost**\n\nThere’s no overhead to the DAO for the implementation of this proposal.\n\n### **Timeline**\n\n**RFC -** January 11th to January 18th\n\n**Snapshot -** January 18th to January 25th\n\n**On-Chain Vote:** January 30th to February 13th\n\n**Execution Delay:**\n\n- February 13th to February 16th - L2 Waiting Period\n- February 16th to February 23rd - L2-to-L1 Message\n- February 23rd to February 27th - L1 Waiting Period\n\n**Please note the aforementioned timeline is tentative and the actual timeline might be slightly different.**",

        "body": "## Abstract\n\nThis AIP proposes the adoption of Timeboost, a new transaction ordering policy for Arbitrum One and Nova. Timeboost enables auctions for the rights to an express lane, giving the winner a time advantage for transaction inclusion and allowing them to potentially capture arbitrage and backrunning opportunities. Proceeds from the auction are at the discretion of the Arbitrum DAO, with two main options outlined in this proposal: collecting bids in ETH or collecting bids in ARB.\n\n## Motivation\n\nArbitrum Chains currently order transactions on a First-Come First-Served basis (FCFS). The motivation to implement FCFS was threefold:\n\n1. Easy to understand and implement,\n2. Replicate Web2 user experience for instant transaction confirmation,\n3. Protect users against front-running,\n\nUnfortunately, relying solely on first-come first-served transaction ordering is not an ideal long-term solution.\n\nWhen opportunities to profitably arbitrage across exchanges arise on Arbitrum, “MEV Searchers” race to get their transaction included before anyone else so that they can capture this profit. This latency race involves a lot of spam, placing stress on chain infrastructure and causing searchers to wastefully invest in faster hardware. Furthermore, none of the MEV generated is captured by the chain and instead all profits are collected by searchers.\n\nTimeboost is a new transaction ordering policy that retains many of the great benefits currently in place for Arbitrum chains, including frontrunning protection and fast block times, while allowing the chain to reduce negative externalities from the racing behavior induced by MEV searchers. Additionally, it can socialize the benefits of the transaction sequencing market back to the ArbitrumDAO.\n\n## Rationale\n\n**Sustainable**: Timeboost offers the ArbitrumDAO an opportunity to capture additional revenue that does not come at the expense of users, since the value being captured already exists.\n\n**Technically-Inclusive**: Rather than capturing arbitrage opportunities by having the fastest hardware, participants can win these opportunities by bidding in an auction.\n\n**Neutral and Open**: The auction for the express lane is permissionless and participation is open to everyone, where the highest bid wins.\n\n**Empowerment**: The Arbitrum DAO can configure all aspects of Timeboost, including enabling or disabling it, the auction’s design, and how to handle proceeds.\n\n## Key Terms\n\n**Express Lane**: A separate path for submitting transactions to the sequencer that has priority access compared to normally submitted transactions.\n\n**MEV**: Maximal extractible value. In the context of Timeboost, MEV refers to the maximum amount of profit someone could make by including their transactions slightly faster than anyone else.\n\n## Specifications\n\nThe full specification for the Timeboost auction can be found here: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/timeboost-design.\n\nThe implementation consists of an auction contract and autonomous auctioneer:\n\n* **Auction contract** - Prospective bidders must deposit funds into the auction contract before bidding in the auction. The contract is also responsible for verifying bidders’ signatures, checking auction contract account balances, deducting the second-highest bid amount from the account of the highest bidder, and handling the proceeds.\n* **Autonomous auctioneer** - An offchain program that receives bids from participants and resolves the top two bids to the auction contract. This AIP proposes that the current sequencer operator provision and set up the autonomous auctioneer, if Timeboost is adopted.\n\nTimeboost changes the guarantees around transaction submission and introduces two different paths:\n\n* **Normal path** - Transactions in the normal path will experience a short delay (defaulted to 200ms), but will otherwise remain unchanged.\n* **Express lane** - Transactions in the express lane do not experience any delay.\n\nNearly all users will continue to submit transactions using the normal path. Timeboost introduces an express lane that can be purchased by sophisticated actors (like searchers) via an auction every minute, with each auction closing 15 seconds before the next round begins.\n\nAll bids in the auction are kept private until after the bid submission deadline and the auction winner will pay the same price as the second-highest bid of that round. A bid will only be accepted if it is at or above a minimum bid (the `reservePrice`). The autonomous auctioneer has the right to change the `reservePrice`, but it cannot be lower than the `minReservePrice`, which can only be changed by the ArbitrumDAO. Note, the `reservePrice` does not represent the expected value of a bid for the express lane, it is just a minimum bid that will be accepted.\n\nWe propose setting the `minReservePrice` to either 0.001 ETH or 3 ARB depending on which currency the DAO votes to collect bids in.\n\nThe ArbitrumDAO can configure the currency in which bids are collected and how the remaining 97% of auction proceeds are handled. This AIP proposes two main options that the community can vote on if it decides to adopt Timeboost. Governance can change these options at any time.\n\n* **Collect ETH** - Collect bids in ETH and send the proceeds to the DAO treasury.\n* **Burn ARB** - Collect bids in ARB and burn the proceeds.\n\nDepending on which option the Arbitrum DAO chooses, the auction contract can either transfer the proceeds to a designated account or burn them.\n\nThe following data sources will eventually be saved and made available after Timeboost goes live on Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova, if this proposal passes:\n\n* Historical bid data for auction participants, outside of the two highest bids (that are otherwise posted on-chain)\n* A way to label/identify which transactions were sequenced in the express lane (i.e. Timeboosted transactions).\n\nFinally, the proposed version of Timeboost is compatible with a centralized sequencer. However, the Timeboost policy will also be compatible with proposals for a decentralized sequencer. 3% of auction proceeds would be set aside for the Arbitrum Developer Guild, which helps fund core Arbitrum development.\n\n## Timeboost Implementation Adjustments\n\n[Timeboost’s design](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/timeboost-design) is the culmination of over a year of research and development by the team at Offchain Labs. While the on-chain implementation will be independently audited by Trail of Bits before the Tally vote, the long term performance of Timeboost can only truly be evaluated with real-world data - data that can help hone and fine-tune Timeboost’s design for the benefit of the ArbitrumDAO.\n\nTo that end, although the auctioneer will function autonomously, **this AIP proposes granting the current sequencer operator the below rights to make the following adjustments from time to time for a period of two (2) years.** The rights described below are expected to only be exercised in circumstances **where doing so would enhance Timeboost’s long-term stability, preserve or improve the user experience for those using Timeboost-enabled Arbitrum chains, increase the security posture, resiliency, or stability of the chain, and/or otherwise help increase revenue for the ArbitrumDAO**:\n\n* The right to adjust the `NonExpressDelayMsec` parameter, which is the default delay that non-express lane transactions would be subject to. The default is 200ms, but adjustments could be to any value between 100ms & 500ms, inclusive.\n* The right to change the `maxBidsPerSenderInRound` parameter, a limit on the number of bids per participant per auction round, to mitigate against active or perceived Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks on the auctioneer. The starting default will be 5.\n* The right to change the `reservePrice` to respond quickly to opportunities to increase the DAO revenue from Timeboost bid proceeds and/or to mitigate the risks of bidders colluding. To start, the `reservePrice` will simply be the minReservePrice.\n* The ability to rotate the auctioneer’s key for submitting bids and the reserve price setter key for changing reservePrice.\n* The right to impose a minimum balance/deposit requirement on Timeboost bidders in order to mitigate against active or perceived Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks. The Arbitrum Foundation and Offchain Labs commits to sharing publicly post-mortems and analyses should this scenario arise.\n* The right to disable Timeboost entirely in the event of a security risk or otherwise malicious attempt to harm Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova node operators, existing deployed applications, and/or end users. The Arbitrum Foundation and Offchain Labs commits to sharing publicly post-mortems and analyses should this scenario arise.\n\nModifications to other Timeboost parameters, including to values outside the specified ranges and to those not already listed above, but which are otherwise listed in the design specification, will require a constitutional governance vote, in accordance with the [ArbitrumDAO Constitution](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/dao-constitution).\n\n## Steps to Implement\n\nIf the ArbitrumDAO approves the AIP, the path would consist of:\n\n1. Discussion of the proposal on the forum (this post) and governance call(s). \n\n2. A vote on Snapshot to decide between*\n  * Option 1 (collect ETH), \n  * Option 2 (burn ARB), or \n  * Option 3 (decline to adopt Timeboost)\n3. Sufficient time for testing on a public testnet, such as Arbitrum Sepolia\n\n4. A third-party, independent audit of the Timeboost auction contract by Trail of Bits and subsequent fixing of any issues found, alongside publication of the audit report.\n\n5. An on-chain vote to deploy the upgrade on Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova.",

        "author": "0xd333Bc5c9670C9cEb18f9A2CF02C6E86807a8227",
        "body": "# Abstract\n\nThis AIP proposes a reduction of the constitutional quorum threshold by 0.5%, lowering it from 5% to 4.5% of the [total Arbitrum votable tokens](https://dune.com/queries/4629041/7761813). The goal is to ensure that well-supported proposals can successfully conclude by aligning quorum requirements with current levels of voter participation, reducing the risk of legitimate initiatives failing due to quorum thresholds not being met.\n\nFor non-constitutional proposals, the existing 3% quorum threshold will remain unchanged.\n\n# Motivation\n\nOver the past year, the 5% quorum threshold for constitutional proposals within the ArbitrumDAO has been challenging, despite support from a broad range of delegates. As the circulating supply of $ARB continues to grow and voter turnout remains relatively flat, quorum requirements are becoming increasingly difficult to meet. \n[ARDC research on governance risks analysis](https://loving-bank-303.notion.site/Part-2-Governance-Risks-Analysis-1b605ac99aec80c282c7fa0105f13ce7) suggest that quorum on constitutional proposals could reach 300M (in base case) in about a year, while participation rate as % of votable supply has gone down from 8% in early 2024 to 4-5% in early 2025. Reducing the constitutional quorum threshold by 0.5% provides a short-term adjustment that enables critical governance to move forward while longer-term reforms are considered and developed.\n\n\n# Rationale\n\nArbitrumDAO is governed by the principles of decentralization, participation, and credible neutrality. This proposal balances those principles by modestly reducing the constitutional quorum threshold to better reflect the current governance environment without undermining the legitimacy of approved proposals. This proposal also would not require any upgrades to existing smart contracts, helping maintain community trust and operational simplicity.\n\nThe 0.5% reduction was selected as a conservative adjustment that is expected to meaningfully improve the likelihood of well-supported proposals reaching quorum, while still maintaining a high enough threshold to deter governance attacks.\n\n# Key Terms\n\n* Constitutional Proposal: A type of proposal within the ArbitrumDAO that modifies governance structures outlined in the ArbitrumDAO Constitution. These require higher quorum thresholds than non-Constitutional proposals.\n\n* Quorum: The minimum number of tokens required to participate in voting for a proposal to be valid and eligible to pass. In this context, it is calculated as a percentage of the total $ARB votable tokens.\n\n# Specifications\n\nThis proposal updates the constitutional quorum threshold from 5% of the total votable tokens to 4.5%.\n\nAs of April 2025, with ~4.3B ARB in votable tokens (formula is total supply of ARB token, which is 10B, minus the amount delegated to the [exclude address](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x00000000000000000000000000000000000a4b86)), the quorum reduction would decrease the requirement by approximately 25 million ARB tokens, bringing the effective quorum from ~215M to ~190M ARB.\n\nNo upgrades to core governance smart contracts are required. Instead, this proposal will include an action contract that uses existing functionality to modify the quorum constant used in the calculation of constitutional quorum thresholds. The action contract will need to be audited, and this is expected to take 1 day.\n\nThe 0.5% reduction represents a minimal-risk, fast-to-implement interim solution, while other long-term solutions can be considered, such as flexible quorum, or franchiser contract.\n\n# Steps to Implement\n\nThe proposal will follow these steps:\n\n1. Forum discussion: This AIP is posted to the ArbitrumDAO forum for discussion and feedback from the community. [DONE]\n2. Temperature Check: An informal offchain vote is conducted on Snapshot to gauge community support. [ON-GOING]\n3. On-Chain Vote: A formal Constitutional AIP and call-to-vote is proposed to Tally for the on-chain vote. This proposal itself will be subject to the existing 5% quorum to pass.\n4. Update Governance Parameters: If passed, the new 4.5% quorum requirement would take effect immediately for all future constitutional proposals.\n\nNo smart contract changes or audits are required, which reduces implementation complexity and cost.\n\n# Overall Cost\n\nThis AIP does not request any grant or budget allocation. It introduces no operational, technical, or recurring costs and does not require smart contract upgrades or audits. Governance configuration changes are handled via on-chain proposal execution and incur only the standard gas costs associated with DAO transactions.",
