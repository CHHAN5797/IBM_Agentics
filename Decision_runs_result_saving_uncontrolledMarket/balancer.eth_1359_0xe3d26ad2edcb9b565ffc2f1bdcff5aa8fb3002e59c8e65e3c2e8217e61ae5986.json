This will serve as a 100% yield bearing pair.\n\n**References/Useful links:**\n\n* Website: https://www.renzoprotocol.com\n* Documentation: https://docs.renzoprotocol.com\n* Github: [Renzo-Protocol · GitHub](https://github.com/renzo-protocol)\n* Discord: [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/renzo)\n* Twitter: https://twitter.com/RenzoProtocol\n* $ezETH Token (Arbitrum): [ezETH (Renzo Restaked ETH) Token Tracker | Arbiscan](https://arbiscan.io/token/0x2416092f143378750bb29b79ed961ab195cceea5)\n* Dune Dashboards: https://dune.com/maybeYonas/renzo-protocol\n\n**Protocol Description:**\n\n[$ezETH] is a Liquid Restaking token and Strategy Manager for EigenLayer\n\nRenzo is the interface to the EigenLayer ecosystem securing Actively Validated Services (AVSs), offering a higher yield than ETH staking.\n\nRenzo introduces the Balancer Gauge for the Renzo [ezETH/wstETH 50/50 pool]. ezETH, Renzo’s liquid restaking token (LRT), captures rewards, ensures liquidity, and simplifies reward management with AVSs. This approach ensures a user-friendly DeFi experience where participants deposit ETH into the liquidity pool, mint ezETH, accumulate rewards, and seamlessly engage in other DeFi activities. Renzo is on a trajectory toward a permissionless validator set, emphasizing composability in DeFi.\n\n**Motivation:**\n\nRenzo is seeking to establish the [ezETH/wstETH 50/50 pool] on Arbitrum on Balancer to further enrich liquidity for ezETH. This move aims to enhance the trading experience across the Ethereum ecosystem, making it more accessible for users while generating additional value to the Renzo community.\n\n**Specifications:**\n \nGovernance:\n\nRenzo currently operates with a multi-signature wallet, featuring doxxed founding contributors. The protocol is planning to decentralize strategy management to ezPoints holders and transition to decentralized governance in the future.\n\nOracles:\n\nRenzo uses ChainLink oracles to price assets (besides ETH) held in the protocol, and in the future, ChainLink will also be used to price assets withdrawn from Renzo.\n\nAudits:\n\nRenzo smart contracts have been audited by Halborn. All of Renzo’s smart contracts are open source.Audits can be found here: [https://github.com/HalbornSecurity/PublicReports/blob/master/Solidity Smart Contract Audits/Renzo_Protocol_EVM_Contracts_Smart_Contract_Security_Assessment_Report_Halborn_Final.pdf](https://github.com/HalbornSecurity/PublicReports/blob/master/Solidity)\n\nCentralization vectors:\n\nCentralization vectors currently revolve around the Oracle, validator management via Figment, upgradeability via proxy multisig contract, and front end hosting.\n\nMarket history:\n\nRenzo currently has two pools live on Balancer [ezETH / WETH](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0x596192bb6e41802428ac943d2f1476c1af25cc0e000000000000000000000659) and the [LRT tri-pool](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0x848a5564158d84b8a8fb68ab5d004fae11619a5400000000000000000000066a). Both pools are in the top 6 on Balancer on Ethereum by TVL.\n\nRenzo strives to be the most secure and efficient liquid restaking token across DeFi and on Ethereum L2s. Renzo is currently focused on diversification efforts to increase the number of node operators on EigenLayer, increasing decentralization and improving security for Actively Validated Services (AVS). Renzo is also working on supporting various LSTs deposits through the platform and building partnerships/integrations across aggregators, DEXs, bridges, Oracle providers, L2s, and other DeFi projects.\n\nValue: The ezETH/wstETH pool on Balancer is intended to serve as a primary liquidity source for the token on Arbitrum.\n\nezETH on Arbitrum: [0x2416092f143378750bb29b79eD961ab195CcEea5](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x2416092f143378750bb29b79eD961ab195CcEea5)\n\nezETH/wstETH Arbitrum pool on Balancer: https://app.balancer.fi/#/arbitrum/pool/0x7a66b9ef65a88e9abc94a08c9b043e73685d850b000000000000000000000517\n\nChild chain gauge: [0x7C4A6B0c16cA99e65822Cc531403cE2f8A20A912](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x7C4A6B0c16cA99e65822Cc531403cE2f8A20A912#code) Mainnet root gauge: [0xCD41Bc6DC6e9821C4C36848Ff3397493e458A5d1](https://etherscan.io/address/0xCD41Bc6DC6e9821C4C36848Ff3397493e458A5d1#code)\n\n### Specification\n\nTransaction: The Balancer Maxi LM Multisig `eth:0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd` and call the `addGauge` function with the following arguments:\n\ngauge(address): `0xCD41Bc6DC6e9821C4C36848Ff3397493e458A5d1`\n\ngaugeType(string): `Arbitrum`",

Inverse DAO governs and develops a suite of permissionless and decentralized financial tools using blockchain smart contract technology. The code base is open source and maintained by the community.\n\nInverse DAO’s core product is DOLA, a debt-backed USD stablecoin. DOLA is added into and removed from circulation;\n\n* On the supply side of money markets, such as DAO-owned protocol FiRM, by Inverse Finance's “Fed” contracts and is then made available to be borrowed through over-collateralized loans.\n* Via injection/contractions into pools such as the Curve DOLA/FraxBP (currently $9.4M TVL), DOLA/USDC on Velodrome ($1.5M TVL), DOLA/USDC on Balancer ($2.8m TVL on ETH, $2.3m TVL on Arbitrum) and DOLA/USDbC on Aerodrome ($16.1m TVL).\n\nDOLA is not \"algorithmic\" and the INV governance token is not used to mint or redeem DOLA.\n\n### Motivation:\n\nWe propose adding the DOLA/sDOLA stableswap pool on Balancer to the gauge controller, a strategic enhancement for both Inverse Finance and Balancer ecosystems. sDOLA, a novel yield-bearing ERC-4626 stablecoin introduced by Inverse Finance DAO, exemplifies innovation in the stablecoin domain. Leveraging Balancer’s advanced capabilities in managing yield-bearing assets, this integration aims to catalyze a dynamic and mutually beneficial relationship.\n\nThe establishment of the DOLA/sDOLA pool is crucial for the seamless operation of sDOLA within Balancer’s ecosystem, especially considering the anticipated growth and utilization of sDOLA. An efficient, aggregator-friendly mechanism for swapping between DOLA and sDOLA is essential to support the fluidity and accessibility of these assets, thereby facilitating the success of future sDOLA partnership pools.\n\nAt the heart of sDOLA's yield generation is the borrowing demand for DOLA on FiRM, Inverse Finance DAO’s fixed-rate lending protocol. Borrowers of DOLA acquire DBR, an interest-bearing token, and spend it over time. Conversely, sDOLA depositors receive streamed DBR via the DOLA Savings Account, which is auto-compounded into sDOLA with an initial earn rate of 0.99 DBR per 1 DOLA staked per year, translating into a forecasted APR range of 11%-19% in the initial months post-launch. This attractive yield profile positions sDOLA as a compelling offering within the Balancer ecosystem. The goal is for sDOLA to be the go-to stablecoin to pair with other stablecoin issuers and reap the rewards of the high intrinsic yield going towards the Balancer flywheel.\n\nBy incentivizing a robust DOLA/sDOLA liquidity pool, we aim to enhance the ecosystem’s attractiveness and utility. This initiative will not only provide a solid foundation for sDOLA’s growth but also offer tangible benefits to the Balancer community and veBAL holders through increased liquidity, protocol fees, and diversification of yield-generating opportunities.\n\n### Specifications:\n\nYou can view analytics for DOLA on Defillama. To learn more about the protocol, please visit our [official docs](https://docs.inverse.finance/inverse-finance/about-inverse), [governance](https://www.inverse.finance/governance) and our [transparency](https://www.inverse.finance/transparency/overview) pages.\n\n> 1. Governance: Provide current information on the protocol’s governance structure. Provide links to any admin and/or multisig addresses, and describe the powers afforded to these addresses. If there are plans to change the governance system in the future, please explain.\n\nInverse Finance Fed contracts mint DOLA directly to the supply side of lending markets or to pools such as the DOLA/FraxBP[ Curve](https://curve.fi/factory/27) pool as demand increases, or they retract and burn DOLA from the supply when demand decreases. The Fed contracts are governed by the Inverse Finance DAO, which is controlled by INV holders through governance. A detailed description of our governance can be found [here](https://www.inverse.finance/blog/posts/en-US/all-about-governance-at-inverse-finance). Equally, check out our transparency portal [here](https://www.inverse.finance/transparency/overview) which gives a visual representation of Inverse Finance Governance.\n\n> 2. Oracles: Does the protocol rely on external oracles? If so, provide details about the oracles and their implementation in the protocol.\n\nInverse Finance’s new fixed-rate money market, FiRM, uses Chainlink price feeds for all markets on FiRM, with some implementations also utilizing Curve EMA price feeds.\n\n> 3. Audits: Provide links to audit reports and any relevant details about security practices.\n\nInverse Finance has undergone multiple audits and bug contests, which can be found linked [here](https://www.inverse.finance/audits). sDOLA was audited by yAudit, which can be viewed [here](https://www.inverse.finance/audits/sDOLA-yAudit.pdf).\n\nThe DAO also now has dedicated members overseeing risk, what we call the Risk Working Group. An announcement of the team’s formation can be found [here](https://www.inverse.finance/blog/posts/en-US/Introducing%20the%20Inverse%20Finance%20Risk%20Working%20Group).\n\n> 4. Centralization Vectors: Is there any component of the protocol that has centralization vectors? E.g. if only 1 dev manages the project, that is a centralized vector. If price oracles need to be updated by a bot, that is a centralized vector. If liquidations are done by the protocol, that is also a centralization vector.\n\nWithin the DAO working groups have been formed to deliver work in specific areas. Often, these working groups will have a Multisig wallet that the DAO governance awards certain roles and limited DOLA or INV allowances in order to carry out required work. All granted privileges and allowances can be reclaimed/disabled by INV token controlled governance. These are:\n\n* Treasury Working Group (TWG): 3 of 5 Multisig with allowances giving access to Treasury funds to optimize treasury management.\n* Risk Working Group (RWG): 1 of 3 Multisig with privileges to pause actions in our (now disabled) lending market.\n* Policy Committee (PC): 4 of 8 Multisig that can change staking reward rate to INV stakers.\n* Fed Chair: 2 of 7 Multisig with the operator role on DOLA Fed Contracts, which allows for DOLA to be expanded/contracted under the Fed smart contract logic (bounded by market conditions)\n\nPlease see our Multisig Wallet section of the transparency portal [here](https://www.inverse.finance/transparency/multisigs).\n\n> 5. Market History: Has the asset observed severe volatility? In the case of stablecoins, has it depegged? In the case of an unpegged asset, have there been extreme price change events in the past? Provide specific information about the Balancer pool: how long has it been active, TVL, historical volume\n\nThe DOLA stablecoin is soft pegged to $1, and like fully decentralized, over-collateralized stablecoins, can experience some volatility around this peg. Larger deviations (below $0.99) often recover fast due to the repegging mechanism built into the protocol (increasing borrowing cost on FiRM, AMM Fed contractions).\n\n \n![sDOLA.png](ipfs://bafkreiekxdao7wlf4iauqysbvf373bxyezr6q2omguesxmhn7wilmh74q4)\n    \n\n### Specification\nTransaction: The Balancer Maxi LM Multisig `eth:0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd` and call the `addGauge` function with the following arguments:\n\ngauge(address): `0xCD19892916929F013930ed628547Cc1F439b230e`\n\ngaugeType(string): `Ethereum`",

This approach ensures a user-friendly DeFi experience where participants deposit ETH into the liquidity pool, mint ezETH, accumulate rewards, and seamlessly engage in other DeFi activities. Renzo is on a trajectory toward a permissionless validator set, emphasizing composability in DeFi.\n\n**Motivation:**\n\nRenzo is seeking to establish the [ezETH/WETH 50/50 pool] on Balancer to further enrich liquidity for ezETH. This move aims to enhance the trading experience across the Ethereum ecosystem, making it more accessible for users while generating additional value to the Renzo community.\n\n**Specifications:**\n \n**Governance:**\nRenzo currently operates with a multi-signature wallet, featuring doxxed founding contributors. The protocol is planning to decentralize strategy management to ezPoints holders and transition to decentralized governance in the future.\n\n**Oracles:**\nRenzo uses ChainLink oracles to price assets (besides ETH) held in the protocol, and in the future, ChainLink will also be used to price assets withdrawn from Renzo.\n\n**Audits:**\nRenzo smart contracts have been audited by Halborn. All of Renzo’s smart contracts are open source.Audits can be found here: [https://github.com/HalbornSecurity/PublicReports/blob/master/Solidity Smart Contract Audits/Renzo_Protocol_EVM_Contracts_Smart_Contract_Security_Assessment_Report_Halborn_Final.pdf](https://github.com/HalbornSecurity/PublicReports/blob/master/Solidity%20Smart%20Contract%20Audits/Renzo_Protocol_EVM_Contracts_Smart_Contract_Security_Assessment_Report_Halborn_Final.pd)\n\n**Centralization vectors:**\nCentralization vectors currently revolve around the Oracle, validator management via Figment, upgradeability via proxy multisig contract, and front end hosting,\n\nOvertime, our goal is to migrate Renzo to utilize decentralized infrastructure.\n\n**Market History:**\nFrom 0 to 100, Renzo launched on EigenLayer Mainnet 1-month ago and has witnessed explosive growth. TVL is nearing +$90M USD, with +33k ETH restaked, and over +4,500 unique depositors.\n\nRenzo’s remarkable growth and strong community backing underscore its prominence servicing users with liquid restaking on EigenLayer. The ezETH/WETH pool on Balancer will mark its inaugural support on a DEX.\n \n \n![veBAL gauge.png](ipfs://bafkreihp6ndnucaokydajbmb5dma6skebx4wffdbcmfotxyrjzrxpf5zaa)\n    \n\n**Value:**\n\nRenzo recently closed a successful seed round in December 2023, raising $3.2 million in equity with a 1:1 Token Warrant. The post-round valuation stands at an impressive $25 million, showcasing strong support for Renzo’s innovative liquid restaking protocol.\n\nRenzo strives to be the most secure and efficient liquid restaking token across DeFi and on Ethereum L2’s. Renzo is currently focused on diversification efforts to increase the number of node operators on EigenLayer, increasing decentralization and improving security for Actively Validated Services (AVS). Renzo is also working on supporting various LSTs deposits through the platform and building partnerships/integrations across aggregators, DEXs, bridges, Oracle providers, L2s, and other DeFi projects. \n\nAbove all, Renzo is committed to building the most successful liquid restaking ecosystem on EigenLayer, delivering rewarding experiences for all restakers and holders of ezETH.\n\n- [Add Pool Gauge Info] https://etherscan.io/address/0xa8B309a75f0D64ED632d45A003c68A30e59A1D8b\n- Rate Provider Review https://github.com/balancer/code-review/pull/4/files\n- The Balancer Maxi LM Multisig eth:0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860 will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at 0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd and call the addGauge function with the following arguments:\n- gauge(address):0xa8B309a75f0D64ED632d45A003c68A30e59A1D8b\n- gaugeType(string): Ethereum\n\nAdditionally, this pool is requesting core pool status as per BIP-457",

        "body": "### [PR with Payload](https://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/286)\n\n**Summary**\n\nProposal to add gauge support for uniETH-wETH composable stable pool with a 2% emissions cap.\n\nuniETH is an institutional friendly liquid staking token that represents ETH staked in Bedrock plus all future rewards from staking. There is more than USD3.7mil ETH staked at the time of writing.\n\n**Protocol Description**\n\nBedrock's native tokenized version of staked Ether is known as uniETH.\n\nuniETH represents the staked ETH in Bedrock plus all future staking rewards. uniETH is non-rebasing, i.e. does not grow in quantity over time but grows in value instead. In other words, 1 uniETH will be worth more than 1 ETH as time goes on, and its value will continue to increase as more time passes. uniETH’s non-rebasing model allows users to hold uniETH on centralized exchanges and use it in decentralized financial applications seamlessly.\n\nLaunched by RockX, Bedrock is a non-custodial solution that satisfies the requirements of institutions seeking a basis for large-scale liquid staking. By bringing new levels of transparency and security to liquid staking, Bedrock allows institutions to unlock liquidity safely by adhering to regulations while leveraging a true crypto-native solution.\n\nReferences/Useful links\n\n[[uniETH DApp](https://bedrock.rockx.com/unieth/stake)]\n[[Learn more about uniETH](https://bedrock.rockx.com/unieth)]\n[[uniETH audit report](https://github.com/RockX-SG/stake/blob/main/PeckShield-Audit-Report-RockXStaking-v1.0.pdf)]\n[[Learn more about Bedrock](https://www.rockx.com/liquid-staking)]\n[[Bedrock DAO Twitter](https://twitter.com/bedrock_dao)]\n[[RockX Twitter](https://twitter.com/rockx_official)]\n[[Discord]()]\n\n**Motivation**\n\nBalancer’s ability to increase capital efficiency using composable pools is taking shape across the industry. The uniETH-wETH pool fits Balancer’s initiative to be a protocol where Liquidity Pools can safely tap into external yield sources while maintaining effective liquidity for swapping:\n\n* uniETH-wETH pool will earn yield for both liquidity providers and Balancer\n* uniETH-wETH pool also provides Bedrock with a place for its tokens to be swapped and deposited easily as the pool increases in TVL\n\n**Specifications**\n\n**Governance**: The BedrockDAO is slated to launch in the coming months with a DAO token that utilizes the vote escrow model for its token holders to participate in protocol governance and more. An update regarding the DAO token can be found [here](https://medium.com/@bedrock_dao/bedrock-1-month-update-whats-next-spoiler-airdrop-e8872425d23d) \n\n**Oracles**: This pool relies on on-chain data calculations, and not on rate providers, to determine uniETH’s balance and estimated rewards.\n\n**Audits**: See uniETH’s smart contract audit by Peckshield [here](https://github.com/RockX-SG/stake/blob/main/PeckShield-Audit-Report-RockXStaking-v1.0.pdf).\n\n**Centralization Vectors**: See the architecture of uniETH [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RockX-SG/stake/main/doc/uniETH_ETH2_0_Liquid_Staking_Explained.pdf). All treasury contracts and protocol upgrades have multi-signature wallets in place.\n\nThe multisignature account is the owner of the following contracts\n\nUNIVERSAL_ETH_ADDRESS: '0xF1376bceF0f78459C0Ed0ba5ddce976F1ddF51F4'\n\nSTAKING_ADDRESS: '0x4beFa2aA9c305238AA3E0b5D17eB20C045269E9d'\n\nREDEEM_ADDRESS: '0x98169228cB99Ed26c1043eD8Ca53A5Cb371D3B8D'\n\nPROXY_ADMIN: '0xa5F2B6AB5B38b88Ba221741b3A189999b4c889C6'\n\nThe manager role to withdraw manager’s rewards: ‘0x4beFa2aA9c305238AA3E0b5D17eB20C045269E9d’\n\n**Market History**: The uniETH token and Bedrock product only went live after our team was able to rigorously test the functionality of staking and unstaking ETH on-chain after the Shapella upgrade. Since its launch, uniETH has been one of the fastest growing liquid staking tokens with more than 2176 ETH (> USD3.7mil) staked on Bedrock.\n\n**Value:** uniETH is poised to drive great value to the Balancer ecosystem because Balancer will serve as the main liquidity provider for the uniETH-wETH swap pair. Balancer provides uniETH holders the option to swap their uniETH for wETH immediately and in amounts of less than 32 ETH, as opposed to observing a 2-10 day unstaking period if executed through the Bedrock product.\n\nBedrock’s uniETH follows AML protocols with KYC/KYB checks required for users who intend to mint more than 32 ETH equivalent of uniETH.\n\n* With this built-in AML capability, uniETH expects to see an influx of institutional funds\n* This will increase the demand for immediate uniETH liquidity on Balancer.\n\nAs a result, liquidity providers will earn the protocol fee on underlying uniETH as well as swap fees.\n\nIn addition, liquidity providers may be entitled to the upcoming Bedrock DAO token airdrop and have access to all its corresponding utilities.\n\n**Pool Address**: 0xbFCe47224B4A938865E3e2727DC34E0fAA5b1D82\n\n**Gauge Address**: 0x6AF7bCA454f3C8165225Ed46FD4d78cc90E81fAA\n\n**Transaction Specification:**\n\nThe Balancer Maxi LM Multisig `eth:0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the `GaugeAdderv4` at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd` and call the addGauge function with the following arguments:\n\ngauge(address): `0x6AF7bCA454f3C8165225Ed46FD4d78cc90E81fAA`\ngaugeType(string): `Ethereum`",
