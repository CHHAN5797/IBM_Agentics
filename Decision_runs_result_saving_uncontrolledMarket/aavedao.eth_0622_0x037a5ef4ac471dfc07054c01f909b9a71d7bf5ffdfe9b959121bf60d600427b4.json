Both Llama & ACI will propose AIPs on onboard assets on V3\n\nUSDT is currently one of the largest V2 stablecoin reserve with ~335m$ supplied\n\nMotivation\nSupporting stablecoin diversity is part of the Aave-Chan Initiative (ACI) delegate platform.\n\nThe ACI does not have any link nor is paid by Tether or any entity to present this ARC.\n\nThe risk parameters provided introduce USDT as a non-collateral asset.\n\nThe Interest rate Strategy curve is the same as for USDT in V2. for now.\nThe ACI is supportive of onboarding USDT as it was in V2.\nFor now, the ACI doesn’t consider V3 mature enough to activate a USD stablecoins emode and consider USDT in it.\nAlso, supply and borrow caps are suggested for this asset to limit risk exposure.\nThey’re currently set to allow reserve utilization to cross the Uoptimal point slightly. But @ChaosLabs & @Pauljlei input is valuable on this.\n\nBy presenting each asset to be onboarded to v3 Ethereum individually, the community can focus on a specific asset, with individual Snapshots determining how to proceed. Finally, approved assets listings can be grouped for the on-chain AIP vote.\n\nSpecification\nTicker: USDT\n\nContract Address: 0xdAC17F958D2ee523a2206206994597C13D831ec7\n\nRisk Parameter\tValue\nIsolation Mode\tNO\nEnable Borrow\tYES\nEnable Collateral\tNO\nLoan To Value\tN/A\nLiquidation Threshold\tN/A\nLiquidation Bonus\tN/A\nReserve Factor\t10%\nLiquidation Protocol Fee\t0.1\nBorrow Cap\t185M\nSupply Cap\t200M\nDebt Ceiling\tN/A\nBase\t0%\nSlope1\t4%\nUoptimal\t90%\nSlope2\t72%\nAdditional note:\nUSDT has been excluded from collateral assets since DeFi inception due to its centralized nature. After years of functioning as intended and witnessing the growth of USDC in the DeFi ecosystem, it seems that reasons for exclusion have fewer grounds in the current DeFi ecosystem and pragmatic approach would be to onboard it in a conservative way and make risk parameters evolve based on market data.\nWhile this ARC doesn’t present a proposal to add USDT as collateral, the ACI thinks the community should consider this as something to discuss at a later stage when V3 will have more maturity.\n\nCopyright\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.",

        "body": "Title: [ARFC] Add LUSD to Ethereum V3 Market\n\nAuthor: @marczeller - Aave-Chan Initiative\n\nDated: 2023-01-31\n\n# Simple Summary\nThis proposal presents Aave with the opportunity to onboard LUSD to the Ethereum v3 Liquidity Pool.\n\n# Abstract\nLUSD is a decentralized stablecoin minted by the Liquity protocol. For more details about LUSD please refers to [Aave V2 ARC by @TokenBrice ARC: Add support for LUSD (Liquity) 3)\n\nThis ARC is a joint effort with @Llamaxyz to allow a selection of assets to be onboarded on V3 via the governance process. Both Llama & ACI will propose AIPs on onboard assets on V3…\n\n# Motivation\nSupporting stablecoin diversity is part of the Aave-Chan Initiative (ACI) delegate platform.\n\nThe ACI does not have any link nor is paid by Liquity or any entity to present this ARC.\n\nThe risk parameters provided within are the same as those provided by Gauntlet within the initial forum post 1 discussing which assets to onboard to v3 Ethereum.\n\nThe Interest rate Strategy curve is the same than for LUSD in V2. for now the ACI is supportive to onboard LUSD as it was on V2, when the V3 will be more mature, the ACI is supportive to work on AIP to allow usage of LUSD as a collateral.\n\nBy presenting each asset to be onboarded to v3 Ethereum individually, the community can focus on a specific asset, with individual Snapshots determining how to proceed. Finally, approved assets listings can be grouped for the on-chain AIP vote.\n\n# Specification\nTicker: LUSD\n\nContract Address: https://etherscan.io/address/0x5f98805a4e8be255a32880fdec7f6728c6568ba0#code\n\nRisk Parameter\tValue\nIsolation Mode\tNO\nEnable Borrow\tYES\nEnable Collateral\tNO\nLoan To Value\tN/A\nLiquidation Threshold\tN/A\nLiquidation Bonus\tN/A\nReserve Factor\t10%\nLiquidation Protocol Fee\tN/A\nBorrow Cap\t1,210k\nSupply Cap\t3,000k\nDebt Ceiling\tN/A\nBase\t0%\nSlope1\t4%\nUoptimal\t80%\nSlope2\t87%\n# Copyright\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.",
