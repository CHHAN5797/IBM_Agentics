        "body": "PR with Payload\nhttps://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/1356\n\n# Introduction\n\nOver the last 9 months, the BD Service Provider (BDSP) has gone from a brand new entity in Q1 to an integral part of Balancer. The BDSP, in partnership with the Maxis and other contributors to Balancer, has helped drive partnerships, liquidity, relationships, and opportunities for Balancer throughout the EVM ecosystem. Numerous partners have commented how they prefer to work with Balancer over other DEXs because of the support they receive from the BDSP and Maxis, and Balancer receives countless inbound requests from prospective partners because of existing partners spreading this via word-of-mouth.\n\nGiven the BDSP has become an integral part of Balancer’s growth strategy, we aim to switch to bi-annual funding starting in Q4 2024. This provides us with more funding stability and also guarantees that resources for the upcoming Balancer v3 launch will be adequately allocated.\n\n# Priorities and Initiatives\n\nThe BDSP will focus on the following priorities and specific initiatives during 4Q24 and 1Q25. For background, the BDSP has shown a consistent track record executing against the proposed initiatives during Q1-Q3. For Q3 performance reports please see [July](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bdsp-july-update/5914) and [August](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bdsp-august-update/5990) reports.\n\n## Initiative 1: Foster growth of the Balancer v2 protocol\n\n**Summary**\n\nWhile every SP plays an important role in generating new opportunities for Balancer, the BDSP’s primary responsibility is finding ways to generate opportunities for Balancer. One of the primary focuses of the BDSP will be continuing to find areas of growth and executing on them.\n\n**Objectives**\n\n1. **Execute liquidity strategy on Balancer v2**\n    - Prioritize yield-bearing assets (LSTs, LRTs, ibStables) or primary strategic assets to generate revenue for Balancer\n    - Find opportunities to deploy new pools on key strategic chains, which includes new pools of Balancer ecosystem projects (e.g. Gyroscope, CowAMM)\n    - Make sure Balancer stays on top of new metas (e.g. BTC LRTs, Veda vaults, etc.)\n    - Retain key strategic liquidity in existing pools\n    - Make sure governance requirements are completed to secure liquidity from partners, where necessary (e.g. AAVE, Frax)\n\n2. **Solicit new partnerships**\n    - Be proactive by finding new prospective partners, reaching out, and engaging in discussions\n    - Be the primary point of contact for inbound partnership inquiries\n    - Facilitate internal discussions for partner evaluation\n\n3. **Grant and incentive programs**\n    - Find grant/incentive programs applicable to Balancer\n    - Apply for these programs\n    - Execute the program, where necessary\n\n4. **Execute veMODE program on Mode**\n    - Launch innovative, ecosystem-wide veMODE program, which leverages a MODE 8020 pool to direct $OP and $MODE rewards to protocols on Mode, in partnership with Mode and Aragon\n    - Work with members of Maxis to coordinate incentive programs and partner incentive management\n    - Collaborate with partners on Mode and the Mode team to generate new pools and acquire liquidity on Mode.\n\n## Initiative 2: Support the launch of Balancer v3 and facilitate growth and adoption.\n\n**Summary**\n\nAlong with the Maxis, the BDSP will play a meaningful role in establishing relationships and partnerships both pre and post v3’s launch.\n\n**Objectives**\n\n1. **Plan and execute on v3 launch**\n    - Work with BLabs and Maxis to finalize rollout plan\n    - Educate new and existing partners on v3 and how they can leverage for new opportunities\n    - Drive v3 liquidity with partners across chains\n    - Support Marketing and BLabs to drive developer engagement and new products\n\n2. **Support deployments on strategic chains**\n    - Work together with the Maxis on chain deployments\n    - Coordinate expansion plans with ecosystem partners\n\n3. **Collaborate with Maxis to advance Balancer tokenomics and the DAOs revenue strategy**\n4. **Continue supporting engineering with aggregator integrations and other technical partnership needs (as necessary)**\n    - Example: working with BLabs to ensure all aggregators are engaged and the partnership between Balancer/BLabs and aggregators is being supported.\n\n## Initiative 3: Partner Support\n\n**Summary**\n\nAs mentioned above, one of Balancer’s strategic advantages - in addition to its technology - is the level of care and support it provides partners. The ‘white glove’ service Balancer offers is exhibited from SPs across the DAO, but the BDSP will continue playing its role as mentioned below.\n\n**Objectives**\n\n1. **Onboard new partners into the Balancer ecosystem**\n    - Help advise on pool type strategy and incentive strategy\n    - Guide through governance / Aura processes and timelines\n    - Help facilitate rate provider review needs and drive to completion in timely fashion\n    - Help facilitate partners’ Points information being included on the Balancer UI (where applicable)\n\n2. **Work closely with Marketing to support co-promotion of new and existing partners**\n3. **Be the primary point of contact, along with members of Maxis, for partners’ non-technical needs. Be responsive and helpful at all times.**\n4. **Continue seeking ways to eliminate friction for partner onboarding**\n    - Example: collaborate with Maxis and Chainlink to utilize CCIP to expedite rate provider deployments\n\n## **Service Provider Name & Overview**: Balancer Business Development Service Provider\n\n**Contributors:** Lipman\n\nPledge to abide by [[BIP-629]](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-629-balancer-dao-service-provider-grantee-standards/5808) Balancer DAO Service Provider & Grantee Standards: Yes\n\n**Domains of Operation:**\n\n* Strategy and Business Development\n* Partner Management\n\n**Key Objectives per Operational Discipline:**\n\n1. **Strategy and Business Development**\n    - Develop and execute liquidity strategies for Balancer v2, focusing on yield-bearing and strategic assets (LSTs, LRTs, ibStables).\n    - Identify and deploy new pools on key strategic chains to drive ecosystem growth (e.g., Gyroscope, CowAMM).\n    - Stay ahead of market trends and metas (e.g., BTC LRTs, Veda vaults) to ensure Balancer's competitive positioning.\n    - Lead efforts to attract new partnerships by engaging with potential collaborators and evaluating partnership opportunities.\n    - Execute governance processes to secure liquidity and incentives from key partners (e.g., AAVE, Frax).\n    - Launch and manage innovative incentive programs like the veMODE initiative, in collaboration with Mode and Aragon.\n    - Collaborate with BLabs and Maxis on the successful rollout of Balancer v3, driving partner liquidity and product adoption.\n\n2. **Partner Support**\n    - Provide ‘white glove’ support to new and existing partners, guiding them through pool creation, governance, and incentive strategies.\n    - Serve as the primary point of contact for partners, ensuring prompt and effective responses to their needs.\n    - Assist partners in navigating Balancer’s ecosystem, including advising on pool types, rate providers, and governance timelines.\n    - Work closely with marketing teams to co-promote new and existing partnerships across the ecosystem.\n    - Streamline partner onboarding by identifying and eliminating friction points, such as collaborating with Chainlink to utilize CCIP for faster rate provider deployments.\n    - Continuously engage with partners to optimize revenue generation and liquidity retention strategies, ensuring long-term success for both parties.\n\n**Reporting**\n\nThe BDSP has provided weekly updates in the DAO-wide Ballers meeting on Mondays, a separate weekly update with the Maxis and Marketing teams on Thursdays, and monthly reports posted to the forum. The BDSP will update the ecosystem and community participants regularly through weekly meetings and monthly community reports:\n\n**Weekly Ecosystem Meeting**\n    - Inform ecosystem participants of our weekly progress and planned activities\n    - Coordinate collaborations and issues with other ecosystem stakeholders\n\n**Monthly reports**\n    - Write up detailed monthly reports on key objectives\n    - Provide a financial statement of the usage of discretionary funds as in previous funding rounds\n\n**Length of Engagement & Budget:**\n\nThe BDSP spent $2k of its Q3 $6k discretionary budget for a part-time contributor during August/September who will not be contributing going forward. The $4k of savings are being requested to roll over to Q424/Q125 at the team's discretion for non-people costs and/or part-time contributors.\n\nThe BDSP has 1 FTE and will be reducing its proposed cost from the [Q3 BDSP funding proposal](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-635-business-development-sp-proposal-for-q3-2024/5798) to $14k/mo in Q4-Q1 vs. $15k/mo in Q3 as well as not asking for any additional discretionary budget. This amount is inclusive of both USDC and vesting BAL amounts.\n\nThe combination of the reduced monthly cost and reduced discretionary budget will result in a $9k savings per quarter for the DAO.\n\nA detailed breakdown of proposed costs is visualized below:\n\n![image|659x500, 75%](upload://xOGL4BZX0DBhoRD5LUIm2Mav4w8.png)\n\n\nLength of engagement: 6 months\n\nBudget: 72,000 USDC and 6,780 BAL\n\nETH Address to Receive Funds: 0xC7E84373FC63A17B5B22EBaF86219141B630cD7a\n\nImpact on the Treasury\n\nThe Treasury wallets currently hold 3,507,473 BAL. Funding the BDSP for the next half year would impact 0.19% of the treasury’s BAL holdings, which annualizes to 0.38% of the treasury’s BAL. The Treasury wallets currently hold 5.727mln in stables. Funding the USDC portion would cost around 1.25% of the treasury’s stable reserve, which annualizes to 2.5%.\n\n### Technical Specification\n\nThe Balancer DAO multisig 0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f will interact with USDC 0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48 by writing transfer passing the BDSP Safe 0xC7E84373FC63A17B5B22EBaF86219141B630cD7a as recipient and amount 72000 USDC as 72000000000.\n\nThe Balancer DAO multisig 0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f will interact with BAL 0xba100000625a3754423978a60c9317c58a424e3D by writing transfer passing the BDSP Safe 0xC7E84373FC63A17B5B22EBaF86219141B630cD7a as recipient and amount 6780 as 6780000000000000000000.",

        "body": "https://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/702\n\n**Introduction & Domains of Operation:**\n\nOver the past nine months, The Beethoven X DAO has strived to play a pivotal role in strengthening Balancer's presence and influence within DeFi.\n\nOur journey commenced in April 2023 when we assumed the role of a dedicated Service Provider, initially focusing on technical support as outlined in[ BIP-254](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-254-funding-proposal-for-beethoven-x-dao/4652).\n\nIn response to the evolving landscape and the departure of Orb Co, The Beethoven X DAO transitioned to bolster Balancer's marketing efforts, originally undertaken by Orb Co.This strategic shift prompted modifications to BIP-254, expanding its scope to include marketing responsibilities.\n\nThe subsequent introduction of [BIP-314](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-314-funding-proposal-for-beethoven-x-dao-marketing/4810) clearly defined the nuanced parameters for the services provided by the Beethoven X DAO, distinctly categorising them into technical and marketing domains.\n\nThe implementation of [BIP-394](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-394-fund-beethoven-x-dao-marketing-for-aug-dec/4973) marked the adoption of a more refined marketing strategy, aiming to build upon the foundation laid over the preceding three months. From August 1, 2023, to December 31, 2023, a concentrated effort has been made to amplify Balancer's presence across social media, highlight various growth pillars central to Balancer's Product-Market-Fit (PMF), continued brand development, and the development of long-term initiatives, aiming for a robust and enduring impact for the Balancer ecosystem.\n\nAdditionally, with the imminent launch of Balancer V3, substantial efforts have been directed towards planning a successful Go-to-Market (G2M) campaign and ensuring an impactful release at the beginning of Q2 24’.\n\nAs the current funding period under BIP-394 draws to a close, this proposal seeks an extension of funding exclusively for the continuation of marketing services from January 1, 2024, to June 30, 2024.\n\nThe subsequent sections will delve into the key objectives and success metrics guiding our past endeavours as well as highlight future goals.\n\n---\n\n**Key Objectives & Success Metrics**\n\nOver the last 5 months, our primary objective in marketing has been to position the Balancer ecosystem as a leading force at the forefront of DeFi innovation. Our strategic focus involves the creation of high-quality educational content on core technology, the cultivation of a robust community, and the amalgamation of a captivating visual identity with an approachable brand voice to reinforce the Balancer vision.\n\nOur approach revolves around a synergistic relationship between users and diverse content forms to sustain and amplify engagement. For an in-depth exploration of our philosophy and marketing strategy, please refer to the following [post.\n](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/rfc-balancer-marketing-analysis/4705/14)\nTo achieve this goal we have focused our energy on the following areas:\n\n* Social Media\n* Core Growth Pillars\n\nBelow we have outlined the intention for these initiatives with relevant KPIs for their measurement/success.\n\n**Social Media:** Social Media (X), plays a pivotal role in Balancer's branding and outreach strategy. As the primary platform for showcasing Balancer's content, Twitter serves as a critical avenue for communicating our brand narrative, educating users on our key products and maintaining a direct line of connection with our audience.\n\nOur social media growth strategy for Balancer encompasses several pivotal elements. We prioritize the creation of consistent content aligned with Balancer's core growth pillars, emphasizing simplicity and educational value. We actively cultivate partnerships to broaden our network impact, refining our visual identity and voice for a cohesive brand representation. Additionally, our engagement extends to community initiatives (AMAs etc.), fostering increased participation and interaction within the Balancer community.\n\n**Content:** Content serves as the linchpin for our entire communication strategy, permeating most aspects of our brand marketing and establishing the overarching tone for the ecosystem. As such a major focus is to deliver high-quality content to our users in a clear and easily digestible manner. Ranginng from individual tweets, to more detailed threads and educational articles we have curated a wide variety of content to dynamically showcase the nuances to both the Balancer ecosystem and its technology.\n\nFor an updated library of Balancer content plese see the following [link.](https://balancer.notion.site/ca695d5e71904d7291d43698f98615d1?v=d4f41a042f0c424ba99f5b9aab17700b&pvs=4)\n\n**Community Contributors:** In addition to core content the contributions from the community contributors have continued to drive significant value for the Balancer ecosystem with weekly Balancer Reports, Gauge Updates, and the staked ETH animations.\n\nFor a list of all community contributor content please see the following content [library.](https://balancer.notion.site/538e20956a59419da640569b5a14a258?v=b4ca723fff314372a7cbac39b8980450&pvs=4)\n\n**KPIs / Data Analysis**\n\n \n![BIP-519.jpg](ipfs://bafybeifqo55laradyf6tdurabet433tust5iojyu3doavav7wpuem64tvu)\n    \n\n*The overall number of followers has increased by 8.7%, for a cumulative total of 1151.86K. The number of impressions has increased by 78%, totalling 6,402,075. Tweet engagement also saw an increase of 106% with a total of 72,128, while the total number of profile clicks was up 99.5% with 21,038.*\n\n**Overview:** From April 01, 2023, to Dec 04, 2023, Balancer has seen significant progress in key social media metrics, reflecting positive impacts on the brand's online presence and engagement.\n\n**Social Media Growth:** The total followers increased by 8.7%, reaching 1151.86K, showcasing consistent community expansion. Impressions increased by 78% to 6,402,075, indicating a broader reach and increased visibility on X (Twitter).\n\n**Engagement Metrics:** Tweet engagement increased by 106% to 72,128, highlighting heightened audience interaction. Profile clicks rose by 99.5% to 21,038, signalling a growing interest in exploring the Balancer profile and the brand.\n\n**General Trend:** A consistent positive trend in Balancer's social media performance is evident, with collective growth in followers, impressions, and engagement metrics. This suggests an expanding and more engaged audience, affirming the effectiveness of SP-led marketing efforts in elevating Balancer's visibility in the DeFi landscape.\n\n**Outliers:** During August and September, two notable exploits impacted the Balancer protocol, causing a spike in activity. This reflected hyper inflated reactions related to the exploits.\n\n**Conclusion:** The cumulative increase in followers, impressions, and engagement metrics underscores the success of our marketing goals during the SP role. This positive trajectory affirms that implemented strategies have effectively contributed to Balancer's growth and engagement on social media platforms, solidifying its relevance in the ecosystem.\n\n---\n\n**Core Growth Pillars**\n\nIn collaboration with the BD team, it was apparent early on that targeting marketing efforts towards the most important areas defining Balancer's PMF was going to be crucial to long term success. To measure efforts in this regard we have identified key core growth pillars that are critical to the success of Balancer’s ecosystem. These pillars are:\n\n* 8020\n* Liquid staked tokens (LSTs) / Boosted Pools\n* Building on Balancer\n* Ecosystem Growth\n\nTo promote the development of each of these core growth pillars the following strategies have been implemented:\n\n**8020:** We have concentrated our marketing endeavours on showcasing the advantages of the 8020 model. Additionally, we've introduced an 8020 partnership initiative, aiming to highlight successful case studies, collaborate on co-marketing initiatives, and develop an educational resource pack. Our goal has been to provide users with valuable insights into the benefits of the 8020 approach.\n\n* [Qi Dao Case Study](https://x.com/Balancer/status/1716877324594131078?s=20)\n* [ParaSwap Case Study\n](https://twitter.com/Balancer/status/1691804406004793749?s=20)[Radiant Case Study](https://twitter.com/Balancer/status/1683854697038516224?s=20)\n* [8020 Initiative Article](https://twitter.com/Balancer/status/1676954525603860481?s=20)\n* [8020 Partnership Pack](https://balancer.notion.site/The-8020-Initiative-999c0a6e1f774e39b02f26b11c581714?pvs=4)\n* [8020 Dashboard](https://dune.com/balancer/8020-initiative)\n\nThere are currently 20+ protocols that have successfully onboarded into the 8020 with more planned for the near future.\n\n**LSTs / Boosted Pools:** With the growing importance of interest bearing assets, Balancer's cutting-edge technology is instrumental in supporting LSTs. To magnify it’s unique PMF we have focused content to highlights the unique features that distinguish Balancer, emphasising its role in hosting and facilitating the growth of LSTs within DeFi.\n\n* [The Balancer LST Hub](https://twitter.com/Balancer/status/1676244564598984704?s=20)\n* [ETHx Case Study](https://twitter.com/balancer/status/1681937019373764609?s=61&t=hl_0kBnKZqMUp5x-XYybZg)\n\n**Building on Balancer:** More than a DEX Balancer offers a clear proposition as a programmable base layer for developers. It has become the backbone for numerous successful projects, streamlining development and unlocking innovation. To amplify this capability we have focused on educating users on the numerous benefits Balancer provides.\n\n* [Understanding Balancer Technology](https://x.com/Balancer/status/1673722923717369857?s=20)\n* [Building on Balancer Series](https://medium.com/balancer-protocol/built-on-balancer-a-new-defi-series-b898b25b4a93)\n* [BoB Gyroscope Case Study](https://x.com/Balancer/status/1714718036505358556?s=20)\n\n**Ecosystem Growth:** Balancer plays a pivotal role in fostering growth across diverse verticals. Whether it's expanding into new ecosystems, facilitating the liquidity growth of supported protocols, or empowering developers to innovate new primitives, our strategic marketing efforts have centred on spotlighting these invaluable benefits.\n\n* [Ecosystem Launch Pad](https://twitter.com/Balancer/status/1666822455745462281?s=20)\n* [Base Launch](https://twitter.com/Balancer/status/1687102165066924035?s=20)\n* [Avax Launch](https://twitter.com/Balancer/status/1687376484032462848?s=20)\n* [Chainlink Rate Providers](https://twitter.com/Balancer/status/1692585845834781039?s=20)\n* [Arbitrum LGP](https://x.com/Balancer/status/1707047608404029627?s=20)\n\n---\n\n**Balancer V3**\n\nSince the Milan Onsite in early October, a significant portion of time has been dedicated towards the planning and execution of a larger G2M campaign for the launch of Balancer 3.\n\nTo maintain consistent momentum for the V3 campaign the G2M strategy has been structured into three distinct phases:\n\n**Phase 1:** Unveiling V3 (Nov - 31 Dec)\n**Phase 2:** Pre-Launch (01 Jan - 17 Mar)\n**Phase 3:** Launch (18 Mar - May)\n\nCurrently, we're moving through the end of Phase 1 with the official unveiling of V3 now behind us. Below, we've outlined the key tasks.\n\n**Phase 1:** Over the course of phase 1 our priorities were set on creating the foundations necessary for a successful start to the V3 campaign. This included:\n\n* BD Notion Partner Pack\n* BD Partner Outreach\n* Teaser Campaign\n* Public Announcement and PR\n* Finalise G2M Campaign\n\nHere's a brief summary on each key action items:\n\n**BD Notion Pack**: This involved creating a notion pack that highlights all of the major technical innovations for Balancer V3.\n\n**BD Partner Outreach:** With the Notion Pack complete, the next step was to build rapport and foster synergy with key partners through in-person calls to inform them about V3 and explore collaboration opportunities / co-marketing.\n\n**Teaser Campaign:** With V3 set for a public unveiling at the beginning of Dec, we set about curating content and coordinating with key partners to ensure a successful release.\n\n**Public Announcement and PR:** Aiming to create general awareness about V3 without revealing full technical details, we focused efforts on building hype for the unveil through a launch article. To amplify this launch we co-marketed with key players in the ecosystem.\n\n* [Launch Post](https://twitter.com/balancer/status/1732037889993883688?s=61&t=gzNsdZuJRQwstDGAUw5qNQ)\n\n**Finalising G2M Campaign:** Fine-tuning details for the larger G2M strategy, including ad campaigns, visual direction, roadmaps, partner relationships and press release.\n\n**Phase 2 & 3:** As we embark on the successful first leg of our journey, the road ahead in phases 2 and 3 requires dedicated efforts to maintain the V3 momentum. Our overarching objective is to meticulously showcase the technical innovations of V3 through an in-depth exploration series, establishing robust partnerships for a united launch and fostering collaboration in BD. Additionally, we plan to refine our PR strategy for optimal coverage, launch diverse ad campaigns and community initiatives to generate excitement and enhance engagement. Education will remain a central theme and we plan to release various forms of educational content to make sure all user demographics are fully informed on the benefits and innovations of Balancer V3. To elevate our branding efforts across the board, we're committed to up-skilling our design department, ensuring that we have a competitive edge in our visual identity/branding efforts.\n\nThere's still much to be done, but we're ready to embrace the challenges ahead and we are focused on making sure Balancer is well-positioned for a groundbreaking and successful V3 launch, solidifying its status as a pioneering force in the DeFi.\n\n---\n\n**Notable Events**\n\n**Security Incidents:** Q3 presented challenges for the Balancer ecosystem, marked by two significant security breaches. During this period, our primary marketing focus shifted towards providing ample space and attention to effectively communicate about the linear pool vulnerability / DNS exploit. In an effort to foster trust and transparency, we temporarily adjusted our regular content schedule, prioritising relevant communications on social media channels related to the security incidents.\n\nThese incidents have served as invaluable learning experiences for our marketing team. The challenges posed by the exploits have reinforced the importance of adaptability and responsiveness in our communication strategy. This period of intense focus on addressing vulnerabilities has not only strengthened our crisis management capabilities but has also deepened our commitment to building trust and transparency within the Balancer community. Moving forward, these learnings will fortify our marketing team, ensuring we are well-prepared to handle unexpected challenges and to maintain an unwavering commitment to open communication.\n\n**Supplementary Funding Update:** Over the course of our SP contract, the requested supplementary budget of up to $5000 USDC per month in BIP-394 for external marketing services (animations, design, content, etc.) was established in response to the discontinuation of Coordinape funding. This reserve was intended as a buffer to temporarily augment service output or engage external expertise as needed. However, to date, there has been no necessity to utilise this potential reserve.\n\n---\n\n**Length of Engagement & Budget:**\n\nFor the services described above, we are requesting an extension of the current funding outlined in [BIP-394] of $30K USDC / month for marketing-related services for the period of January 1, 2024, until June 30, 2024.\n\nOur marketing efforts consist of 2 FT contributors working at 100% as well as 2/3 PT contributors working at 25-50%. As our team is small, our contributors work across several disciplines; Jedi and Naly (FT) work on the overall marketing strategy, content curation, and social media management. Vee (PT) works on brand development and visual design. Skly (PT) specialises in smart contract development and assists with technically focused articles. Jeff (PT) works on BD and partnership coordination.\n\nAdditionally, outside of the active contributions this month, the Beethoven X DAO has access to several contributors whose expertise ranges from financial accountants, quantitative analysts, and engineers to DeFi social scientists with PhDs that we will tap into as and when needed, all scoped within the above budget.\n\nThese funds will be used solely to cover contributor salaries and as such we request that this amount be made available in a liquid form.\n\nIf approved, $30,000 USDC would be sent to the below ETH address around the first of each month.\n\nETH Address to Receive Funds: 0x811912c19eEF91b9Dc3cA52fc426590cFB84FC86\n\nMoreover, we propose the continuation of a potential for a supplementary budget of up to $5000 USDC per month dedicated to financing external marketing services (animations, design, content, etc.), to be administered by the Balancer DAO. This allocation would be invoked solely on an as-needed basis, adhering to a maximum cap of $5000 USDC for any given month, with all expenditures meticulously documented in a monthly budget breakdown. The envisaged application of this budget aligns strategically with the significant V3 launch in Q2 2024, offering a valuable resource to maximise the effectiveness of our G2M strategy. In the event we need to cover costs larger than that stipulated in the buffer budget for marketing efforts around the V3 launch, a separate proposal to the Balancer DAO will be made.\n\n---\n\n**Closing Remarks**\n\nIn conclusion, the past nine months have seen The Beethoven X DAO actively contribute to enhancing Balancer's position in the DeFi space. As we navigate these dynamic landscapes, our commitment remains steadfast, and we are poised to overcome future challenges while maintaining an unwavering dedication to transparency, trust, and communication within the Balancer community.\n\nWe are honoured and deeply grateful for the opportunity to play a role in Balancer's success. While we take pride in our accomplishments thus far, we view them as milestones in an ongoing journey of improvement and heightened contribution. Our team maintains a long-term outlook, aspiring to continuously evolve and be the best version in service to Balancer and its community.\n\nAs we anticipate the pivotal launch of V3, our determination and commitment are only strengthened. This significant event marks a crucial moment in Balancer's trajectory, and we are enthusiastic about contributing to its success, further solidifying Balancer's pioneering role in the DeFi space.",

        "body": "### PR with Payload\nhttps://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/1532\n\n**Service Provider Name:** Beethoven X - Marketing\n\n **Leader(s):** Jedi Rasta, Naly\n\n**Pledge to abide by [[BIP-629]](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-629-balancer-dao-service-provider-grantee-standards/5808) Balancer DAO Service Provider & Grantee Standards**: Yes \n\n### **Introduction**\n\nBalancer v3 represents the most significant evolution in our platform’s history, showcasing unparalleled innovation in DeFi.

This approach maximizes cost-effectiveness and streamlines outreach, crafting a cohesive narrative that resonates across multiple channels.\n\n**Amplification to Drive Focused Engagement**\n\nAn amplification campaign educates the market, enhances mindshare, and drives adoption by highlighting v3’s unique features in DeFi-native newsletters and outlets. These efforts expand awareness among liquidity providers and DeFi-native users, fueling the user acquisition funnel.\n\n**Creative Marketing for Enhanced Engagement**\n\nInteractive and gamified content will enhance community engagement and highlight the innovative features of v3 in a visually compelling and accessible way. By targeting both DeFi-native and new audiences, creative marketing will complement PR and amplification efforts to maximize the launch’s impact.\n\n### **Funding Breakdown**\n\nTo maximize the impact of the Balancer v3 launch, we have identified the following strategic outreach and creative marketing needs:\n\n**1.

Creative Marketing Campaign**\n\n- **Scope**: Development of interactive and gamified content to enhance community engagement and showcase v3’s innovative features.\n- **Benefits**:\n    - Engages users through visually compelling and interactive content.\n    - Drives awareness by highlighting v3’s unique benefits in a dynamic and accessible way.\n    - Complements PR and amplification efforts by targeting DeFi-native and new audiences.\n- **Estimated Cost**: **$10,000**.\n\n**Summary**\n\n| **Category** | **Allocation** | **Description** |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **PR Agency Partnership** | Up to $35,000 | Comprehensive media management, press releases, influencer outreach, and strategy. |\n| **Amplification Campaign** | Up to $15,000 | Short-term amplification via Chainwire and DeFi-native newsletters. |\n| **Creative Marketing Campaign** | Up to $10,000 | Development of interactive and engaging content for v3's launch. |\n| **Total Requested Funding** | **$60,000** | Ensures impactful marketing and outreach for the v3 launch. |\n| **Unused Funds** | N/A | Returned to the DAO by the end of Q1 for transparency and accountability. |\n\n### **Execution Plan**\n\n1. **Secure PR Partner**: Engage a full-service PR agency to lead media outreach efforts and manage key campaigns.\n2. **Execute Amplification Campaign**: Deploy amplification strategies using Chainwire and targeted DeFi-native newsletters to enhance v3 launch visibility.\n3. **Execute Creative Marketing Campaign**: Develop and distribute interactive content to highlight v3’s unique features, engaging both existing and new audiences.\n4. **Align Marketing Efforts with v3 Timeline**: Synchronize all activities with the v3 launch schedule to ensure maximum impact.\n5. **Measure and Report**: Post-launch, provide the DAO with a comprehensive report, including outreach results, engagement metrics, and budget utilization.\n\n### Funding and Allocation\n\nThe requested $60,000 will flow through OpCo, which will manage all payments and spending related to the Balancer v3 launch efforts, ensuring efficient use of funds. This funding will cover PR, amplification, and creative marketing initiatives. OpCo’s oversight will ensure that expenditures align with our broader financial planning and support for the Balancer ecosystem. Any unspent funds will be returned to the DAO by the end of Q1, reflecting our commitment to transparency and financial prudence.\n\nThe multisig 0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f will interact with USDC at 0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48 by writing transfer, passing 0x3B8910F378034FD6E103Df958863e5c684072693 as recipient and the amount 60000 as 60000000000.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe launch of Balancer v3 represents an unprecedented opportunity to solidify Balancer’s leadership in DeFi.

Recognized as key contributors and the vital link between partners and the protocol, our dedication to the DAO is unwavering. As we embark on another quarter, our commitment is not just to continue, but to evolve – to redefine our engagement and amplify our positive impact on the DAO in 2024.\n\nThe third quarter marked a significant transition for the Maxis. Following the departure of our strategic visionary, Solarcurve, we embraced change and innovation. Tritium rose to the occasion, leading critical initiatives like the [core pool incentive automation](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-457-core-pool-incentive-program-automation/5254), as well as securing and executing on the Arbitrum STIP, demonstrating our adaptability and resilience.\n\nOur evolution goes beyond roles and responsibilities. The Maxis are transforming from a collective of passionate enthusiasts to a team of full-time, professional experts. The new full-time addition consists of @Xeonus who will spearhead our strategic direction.\n\nOur mindful approach to funding allocation ensures an efficient use of resources – balancing USDC and BAL demands with maximum effectiveness. Our focus is not just on growth but on impact and transparency.\n\nIn 2024 we want to make the most impact by driving forward exciting initiatives while providing excellent mission-critical services to the DAO. We have identified four main (non-v3 dependent) initiatives to channel our efforts, while continuing to provide the core services that have been the backbone of the DAO for over two years.\n\n## Initiatives\n\nBeyond regular operations, the Maxi’s are focused on trying to create successful narratives in the Balancer ecosystem through various focused initiatives. In 2024, we strive to focus on a few of them, ensure that our focus areas have a clear leader/champion and some defined goals and that time and resources are available to focus on these topics. The impact of those topics is directly related to the achieved objectives.\n\n### Initiative 1: Growth beyond Mainnet\n\nLead: Tritium\n\nTeam: Shakotan (tech and operations), Xenous (data)\n\nKey ecosystem interactions: Grants Committee, Beethoven (Marketing + Beets grants)\n\nSummary\n\nThe initiative aims to further strengthen the DAO's presence beyond mainnet, focusing on Arbitrum, zkEVM, and Gnosis. The initiative emphasizes the successful execution of the Arbitrum STIP, but most of all development of strong competencies in creating data-driven narrative showcasing Balancer’s competitiveness, and collaboration with key blockchain partners such as Polygon and Aribtrum. The strategy includes adaptability to pivot based on market trends and performance metrics and an ever growing understanding of the KPIs that our grant providing partners care about.\n\nObjectives\n\n1. Timely STIP Execution: Ensure punctual and successful delivery of the current STIP, including consistent reporting and active engagement with the DAO.\n2. Data Narrative Development: Work to build a competency within Balancer to tell stories about how we are using our emissions to drive growth for our protocol and in the ecosystems we exist in.\n\n  1. We should be able to put out velodrome style reports that tell our story.\n\n3. KPI-Focused Program Management: Stay close to various grant programs and look at successful grant recipients to understand the KPIs they set and how they achieve them.\n\n  1. Propose changes at Balancer to make this possible or point out why we are not well suited to meet the kinds of KPIs that chain ecosystems see value in.\n\n4. Next Grant Cycle Preparation: Identify potential grant sources for the upcoming cycle and strategize engagement.\n5. Feedback Integration: Actively seek and incorporate feedback to enhance the effectiveness of the initiative.\n6. STIP Comparative Analysis: Collaborate with the STIP body to assess and report on Balancer's performance in comparison to peers.\n7. Impact Report Creation: Develop a comprehensive report detailing the impact of extra incentives delivered through balancer on L2 ecosystems.\n8. Strategic Partnerships: Strengthen collaborations with Gnosis Chain, Base, Arbitrum and Polygon to share successes and apply learnings, particularly in the context of zkEVM scaling.\n9. Collaborate with Beets as much as possible to create a shared competency here.\n\n### Initiative 2: Redesign of the Gauge Framework v1\n\nLead: Xeonus\n\nTeam: Shakotan (building automation), Tritium, Zekraken, Zen Dragon and Mike B (design)\n\nSummary\n\nThis initiative aims to introduce an automated, dynamic system for evaluating and adjusting gauge emissions based on performance metrics. This new framework is designed to efficiently allocate BAL rewards, optimizing support for both high-cap and emerging projects. The goal is to ensure a more responsive and adaptable system that balances revenue optimization with nurturing potential future revenue generators.\n\nObjectives\n\n1. Automated Gauge Evaluation: Develop a system for automatic assessment of gauges based on predefined metrics.\n2. Dynamic Emission Cap Adjustments: Implement a mechanism to adjust emission caps (ranging from 2% to 10%) based on gauge performance, potentially reducing underperforming gauges to a certain cap (e.g. 0.5%).\n3. Adaptive Framework: Ensure the framework is responsive to market dynamics and capital efficiency, allowing for more flexible and efficient allocation of BAL rewards.\n4. Rules around Duplication: Rules for handling the same Token in multiple pools/chains or the same DAO with multiple tokens.\n\n### Initiative 3: Support Balancer v3 Design\n\nLead: Mike B\n\nTeam: Xeonus, Zen Dragon, Tritium, Shakotan(tech and automation)\n\nKey ecosystem interactions: Balancer Labs, Beethoven (Tech)\n\nSummary: Balancer v3 is set to compete with the established developer community of Uni v4. It's crucial to foster the development of a robust ecosystem based on Balancer v3, ensuring it offers a compelling alternative for developers and projects.\n\nObjectives:\n\n1. Onboarding of Innovative Teams: Attract and integrate teams that are developing novel automated market makers (AMMs) for Balancer v3.\n2. Market Fit Identification for v3 Products: Assess and establish the market relevance of v3 offerings like TWAMMs, boosted pools, and dynamic ECLPs, and effectively pitch these to ecosystem projects.\n3. Serving as a Liaison: Act as the primary point of contact for external teams working on Balancer v3, facilitating seamless communication and collaboration.\n4. Technical Support Coordination: Collaborate with the integrations and BLabs teams to ensure that building teams receive adequate technical assistance.\n5. Finalizing v3 Feature Scope: Conclude the initial feature set for Balancer v3, aligning it with market needs and developer capabilities.\n\n### Initiative 4: Automation ownership transfer & on-chain automation improvements\n\nLead: Shakotan\n\nTeam: Tritium\n\nKey ecosystem interactions: Balancer Labs\n\nSummary:\n\nOngoing automation for both on-chain and off-chain processes. Improving existing operational contracts, such as Gauge injector and improving Defender codebase so it becomes maintainable.\n\nObjectives\n\n1. OZ Defender automation takeover from Balancer Labs and Markus\n2. Full tech and development for on-chain tasks\n3. ChildGaugeInjector version 2 release with new features + factory deployment to support better events and data used by Data Team\n4. Potential fees-handler-sc implementation to reduce rugability of the fees bags + improve data flow.\n\nService Provider Name & Overview: Balancer Maxis\n\nLeader(s): Xeonus, joined by the talented Mike B, Zekraken, Zen Dragon, Danko, Tritium, Shakotan and Gosuto\n\nContributors (a.k.a.

Funding the Balancer Maxis for Q1 2024 would cost around 0.9% of the treasury’s BAL holdings, which annualizes to ~3.5% of the treasury’s BAL. The Treasury currently holds ~4.3M in USDC. Funding the USDC portion would cost around 2.5% of the treasury’s USDC, which annualizes to ~10%.\n\nFurthermore, this table provides an overview of the last years impact putting this proposal into perspective:\n\n|Year|Quarter|BAL|BAL Price|USDC|ETH|ETH price|Operations cost|People cost|Total|\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|2023|Q1|48000|$6|$0.00|0|1201|0|$266,400|$266,400.00|\n|2023|Q2|42150|$7|$0.00|5|1795|8975|$291,257|$300,231.50|\n|2023|Q3|26025|$5|$132,630.00|20|1853|37060|$251,825|$288,884.50|\n|2023|Q4|31695|$3|$168,770.00|20|1652|33040|$271,779|$304,819|\n|2024|Q1|35718|$4|$108,095.00|20|2170|43400|$250,969|$294,369|\n\nAlthough the Maxis will have around 1 FTE more manpower at their disposal, the impact on the treasury stays nearly the same. Maxis have undergone internal optimizations in pay to reduce the impact on the DAOs USDC as much as possible given the current market conditions. In that regard, 49.5% of requested funding will be locked in our stkauraBAL vesting contract. We will also roll over $37,720.00 in savings from our Q3 and Q4 budget (bizdev, bounties etc.) and deduct that amount from the current proposal, which further reduced our overall demand for USDC.\n\nETH Address to Receive Funds: `0x166f54F44F271407f24AA1BE415a730035637325`\n\nLink to SLA (if going through the Foundation): N/A\n\nTechnical specifications\n\nThe Balancer DAO multisig `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` will interact with USDC `0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48` by writing `transfer` passing the Maxi Safe `0x166f54F44F271407f24AA1BE415a730035637325` as recipient and amount `108095` USDC as `108095000000`.\n\nFurthermore the Balancer DAO multisig `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` will interact with BAL `0xba100000625a3754423978a60c9317c58a424e3D` by writing `transfer` passing the Maxi Safe `0x166f54F44F271407f24AA1BE415a730035637325` as recipient and amount `35718` as `35718000000000000000000`\n\nThe DAO Multisig `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` will interact with WETH `0xC02aaA39b223FE8D0A0e5C4F27eAD9083C756Cc2` by writing `deposit` with amount `20` to wrap the required ETH.

        "body": "**Service Provider Name:** Balancer OpCo (Product Team)\n\n**Core Contributor(s):** Gareth, Alberto, Anastas & Pon\n\n**Adhere to [[BIP-372] ](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-372-adopt-sp-standards/5009)and the SP standards:** YES\n\n**Introduction**\nBalancer OpCo Limited (or the “Balancer OpCo”) is a wholly-owned operating subsidiary of the Balancer Foundation. It is an integral element of the Balancer Foundation corporate structure supporting the Balancer DAO. It serves two primary functions (1) Administrative and Operational; and (2) Product Development.\n\nSince the passing of [BIP-55](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-55-funding-proposal-for-the-balancer-opco/3609) and its subsequent extension ([BIP-351](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip351-funding-proposal-for-the-balancer-opco-product-team-fy23-q3-through-fy24-q1/4927)), Balancer OpCo has been an integral element of the DAO since July 2022. This proposal aims to extend the product development services for an additional 6 months (April 1, 2024 - September 30, 2024). As in the previous proposal, the administrative and operational elements provided by Balancer OpCo are submitted as a separate proposal.\n\nOur primary roles include Frontend Team Lead (Gareth), Frontend Core Engineers (Anastas and Alberto), and Product Designer (Pon). We also contract Ansaf, a long-time community member and experienced frontend developer, on a part-time basis.\n\nThe proposal period has been reduced from 9 months to 6 months to align with other service providers. Balancer OpCo is requesting $373,290 and 15,711.56 BAL for 6 months of funding starting April 1, 2024 and ending September 30, 2024.\n\n**Retrospective**\nBalancer OpCo product team was previously funded ([BIP-351](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip351-funding-proposal-for-the-balancer-opco-product-team-fy23-q3-through-fy24-q1/4927)) for 9 months from July 1, 2023, through to March 31, 2024.\n\nOur high-level goals stated in the previous proposal are as follows:\n\n* Increase LP engagement and satisfaction.\n* Increase veBAL adoption and holder engagement.\n* Increase awareness and adoption of the Balancer protocol.\n\nThese goals have not changed and will continue to guide our focus as we build out v3 of the Balancer canonical app.\n\nBefore shifting focus to v3, our primary focus was to track and improve the general user/LP experience in the v2 app. The KPI we used to do that was the Transaction Flow Error Free Rate, which is fatal errors in transaction flows divided by the total number of successful transactions submitted through the UI. When we started tracking this in July 2023 we were at ~84%. A concentrated effort was made to fix all fixable bugs in those flows and by February 2024 we were able to improve that rate to ~95%. It’s possible with further concentrated effort we could improve that KPI by 1-2%, however, some portion of the remaining 5% are bugs and issues that can be very challenging to resolve, such as wallet errors and specific user network/device issues.\n\nAlthough our focus was generally on improving UX and supporting growth opportunities in the v2 app, very early on in our previous funding period it became clear that we would need to shift focus to a new canonical web application that would support both Balancer v2 and v3 vaults. The reasons behind this are outlined in our [November monthly update](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/opco-product-team-november-2023-update/5417). In November 2023 we publicly put the v2 app into maintenance mode and shifted our focus to the v3 app.\n\nDespite most of our focus being directed towards the v3 application, we have done our best to support growth opportunities in v2 as they arose. An example of this is quickly supporting LRT pools and making them easily findable. We recognise that opportunities for the Balancer ecosystem, like LRTs, are extremely important for the growth of the protocol and we will always do what we can to support marketing and partnership operations through improvements in the UI.\n\nIn September 2023, Tim who was responsible for our backend infrastructure moved on to a new opportunity. Tim had built our v2 API that still serves the v2 frontend application. For v3, we will be using the shared Beets/Balancer API which is managed by Franz at Beets. So we are not looking to hire a replacement and therefore our people costs for this funding cycle are lower.\n\n**Key Objectives and Success Metrics**\nOur key objective for this funding proposal is to launch the v3 web application. The primary motivation for building a v3 app is to build support from the ground up for both v2 and v3 vaults and make the app multi-network native, that is, users will be able to explore and interact with pools across all networks and vaults within the same app. This would have been extremely difficult to do well within the context of the v2 app. This objective also includes a complete rebranding of the Balancer UI/UX.\n\nWe have already made significant progress towards this objective and aim to launch a beta UI by mid-April 2024. Following the beta launch, we will complete support for the v3 vault and launch the UI to the general public alongside the launch of the v3 protocol. The current target for the v3 launch is the end of Q2, 2024.\n\nOur secondary objective is to begin to deprecate the v2 application and its supporting infrastructure. The supporting infrastructure such as the v2 API contributes to our costs and the quicker we can deprecate it the quicker we can lower Balancer OpCo’s 3rd party software costs.\n\nThe success metrics for these objectives are clear, the protocol needs a UI that can support the v2 and v3 vaults, and the UI development should not delay the launch of the v3 protocol. However, our success metrics, besides launching the new app and v3 support, remain essentially the same as with v2. Our focus is on improving the experience and engagement for LPs and veBAL holders. We are already tracking some relevant KPIs (Transaction Flow Error Free Rate & NPS). We will continue to track and report these KPIs as we launch the v3 app.\n\nIn summary, Balancer OpCo’s product team is committed to building a market-leading DApp for the Balancer protocol and supporting growth opportunities through UI development as they arise. The product team are passionate about Balancer and committed to its long-term success.\n\n**Ongoing commitments**\nThe Product Development team ensures Balancer has a high-quality UI/UX available everywhere that allows users to interact easily with the Balancer protocol. In addition, the UI serves as a branding tool where people can better understand what the Balancer Protocol allows. The team will:\n\n* Build, Improve and Optimize the canonical UI for interacting with Balancer\n  * We aim to provide the best possible experience for users to provide liquidity, swap, lock veBAL, vote on gauges, and claim earnings using Balancer.\n  * We will design, build and maintain the marketing pages for the Balancer protocol. The primary aim of these pages will be to inspire and help onboard potential partners into the ecosystem.\n  * We ensure this UI works across all modern devices including desktop and mobile browsers.\n  * We will continually optimize and improve this app so users have a great experience no matter how many features or how much data Balancer introduces in the future.\n  * We will continually work on the stability and reliability of the UI by covering its critical functionality with unit, integration and eventually E2E (End to End) tests.\n  * Whenever new features or improvements are made to the Balancer smart contracts we will implement the primary UI for users to interact with them on launch.\n  * This also includes responsibility for all copywriting across the app.\n* Ecosystem design support\n  * We will support broader ecosystem design initiatives. For example, we’ll collaborate with marketing on creative direction and occasional asset production.\n* Support the development and maintenance of the shared Beets/Balancer API\n  * The Product Development team currently maintains the Balancer API at https://api.balancer.fi, which provides quick access to Balancer pool and token information, as well as a SOR interface that services such as CowSwap use to calculate the best trade routes through Balancer pools.\n  * The existing API mentioned above will be deprecated in favour of the shared Beets/Balancer API at https://api-v3.balancer.fi.\n  * Additional functionality will be added to the shared Beets/Balancer API to support a simpler UI layer for v3.\n* User support\n  * We will monitor relevant channels in Discord, Slack and Github issues for any reported problems and aim to respond within 24 hours and fix the problem as soon as possible.\n* OpCo operations\n  * Manage DNS for all Balancer DAO domains.\n  * Manage user accounts/email addresses under those domains.\n  * Manage 3rd party accounts, upgrades, renegotiations, etc. For example, RPC providers, AWS, and wallet check providers.\n\nGithub repositories that we are directly responsible for:\n\n* https://github.com/balancer/frontend-v3\n* https://github.com/balancer/frontend-v2 (to be deprecated)\n* https://github.com/balancer/balancer-api (v2 API, to be deprecated)\n* https://github.com/balancer/tokenlists\n* https://github.com/balancer/marketing-site (to be deprecated)\n* https://github.com/balancer/metadata\n\nGithub repositories we are not directly responsible for but contribute to:\n\n* https://github.com/balancer/balancer-sdk\n* https://github.com/balancer/b-sdk\n* https://github.com/balancer/docs\n* https://github.com/balancer/backend\n\n**Reporting**\nThe Product Development team is committed to transparency and openness in all our work. The majority of our day-to-day activities can be followed via the previously mentioned repositories. We are also committed to providing higher-level reporting on our work in the relevant calls and on the forum. Our reporting commitments will be as follows:\n\n* Weekly v3 roadmap call\n  * Audience: Internal, engineering and ecosystem leadership.\n  * Here we share status updates on our latest work and take note of any urgent requirements or future work for our team.\n* Monthly forum update\n  * Audience: Public\n  * A high-level written report of work done over the past 30 days, including how that work relates to our stated goals. We will also include reflections on challenges that may be standing in the way of progress on those goals.\n  * Relevant metrics that the Product Development team’s work has a direct impact on.\n* Quarterly community call update (if applicable)\n  * Audience: Public\n  * A higher-level update on the work done over the last quarter and work planned for the next quarter, including KPIs and visual content if relevant. This update will also include reflections on the team and its performance and any changes to the overall direction described in this funding proposal or previous quarterly reports.\n\n**Length of Engagement & Budget**\nBalancer OpCo product team is requesting 6 months of funding starting April 1, 2024 and ending September 30, 2024.\n\nWe request a total budget of $373,290 for the full period. Note that Balancer OpCo holds enough funds to cover the requested funding. This was saved due to the reduction in spend achieved by OpCo and other Service Providers vs their original budgets in years 1 and 2. For that reason, no new funding is required from the DAO for this proposal. The table below shows the applicable expense categories by quarter.\n![bip-565-2.png](ipfs://bafkreibzvgelwxzehhvztwqftrggjbhvbum4k6rhjj6i5abtoryqhpgoom) \n\nNote that Non-People Costs are reduced in Q2 as we transfer some of those costs into the Balancer OpCo Admin & Ops [supplementary proposal](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-xxx-opco-admin-ops-supplementary-budget-for-q2-2024/5628). These costs are for 3rd party services that are used throughout the ecosystem and are critical to the ongoing operation of the DAOs infrastructure. We are referring to these as “Protocol Infrastructure”.\n\nA further breakdown of the Balancer OpCo Product Team costs is shown below:\n![bip-565-1.png](ipfs://bafkreigag7amrn6sougc46ncjc57gyaoioz3o4qgsbyhwsntolcqzsdjei)\n    \n\nIn addition, the Balancer OpCo is requesting an allocation of 15,711.56 BAL for the 6 month period of the proposal that aligns with the grants included in staff employment packages. This BAL would be awarded as compensation to current team members on a 4-year vesting basis, with a 1-year cliff, starting from each employee’s initial employment date in the ecosystem.\n\nShould any of these employees leave before the completion of the 2 quarter proposal period, any unvested BAL would not go to the departing employee and would be available to the OpCo for allocation as incentives to potential replacement staff.\n\n**Link to Service Provider Agreement (if going through the Balancer OpCo)**\nNot applicable given this entity is internal. The Product team will be directly accountable to the Balancer OpCo and the Balancer DAO community through the reporting process applicable to all Balancer SPs, primarily with reference to the objectives and KPIs noted above.",
