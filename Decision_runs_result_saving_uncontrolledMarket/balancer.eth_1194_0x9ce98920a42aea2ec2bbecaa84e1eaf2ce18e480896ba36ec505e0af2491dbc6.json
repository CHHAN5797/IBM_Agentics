        "body": "### PR with Payload\nhttps://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/830\n\n## Summary\n\nThe Balancer Maxis are assisting DAO participants in deploying pools and gauges, monitoring and funding various mission-critical components such as transmitting BAL rewards to gauges across deployments. Given the uptick in average gas costs in recent days, we have identified that the currently allocated budget will not be sufficient to continue operations until the end of March. Therefore, the Maxis are asking for 50 ETH to fund operations for the upcoming months.\n\n## Motivation\nThe Maxis are responsible for various operational tasks across the DAO such as pool deployments, gauge creations and funding of our OZ defender infrastructure and distribution of voting incentives. These involve spending ETH to fund these operations. We have built a monitoring dashboard visualizing our gas spending over time: https://dune.com/scoffie/advancedmaxigasstation \n\nAs of the writing of this proposal, the gas station is running low on ETH, currently sitting at 1.8 ETH. Additionally, the Maxi Ops wallet `0x166f54F44F271407f24AA1BE415a730035637325` currently holds 2 ETH. Given the gas station is responsible to fund various critical components such as the BAL reward distributors across networks, these funds will likely not last until the end of March. In the past, Maxis requested approximately 20 ETH per quarter to fund these operations. Based on these metrics we ask for an additional 50 ETH that shall be spent over the next 5-6 months depending on network activity. Maxis will make sure to execute most transactions at the lowest possible fee rates. The funds will then be managed by the Maxi operations wallet to periodically fund the gas station  when needed.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nThe DAO Multisig `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` will transfer 50 ETH to the Maxis Multisig address as the recipient `0x166f54F44F271407f24AA1BE415a730035637325`.",

        "body": "Payload with PR\nhttps://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/916\n\nOverview\n\nOriginally when BeethovenX was approved as a friendly fork 10 million BEETS was set aside for the DAO to unlock via a vest. This can be seen here in the original vote. https://vote.balancer.fi/#/proposal/0x95db8e797145ad590b467f8dbecb23404c25c2a7090aa8a8d65428ad9f7373fc to receive 4% of the total supply, 250M tokens, which can be confirmed in BEETS [tokenomics](https://docs.beets.fi/beets/tokenomics). The purpose of this proposal is to update the fantom wallet responsible for this vesting contract with the maxis as signers. The maxis will then claim the fully vested balance of BEETS, and transfer it to the DAO Multisig on Optimism. This is to make the bridging process streamlined. For the time being this will consolidate the multisigs utilized by the DAO as fantom is a relatively inactive network. There is no plan to utilize the BEETS tokens in any way for the time being, but an additional proposal can be made to do so at a later time.\n\nThe current DAO Multisig on Fantom will not be utilized after these actions unless absolutely necessary after this proposal. The likelihood of it's use is incredibly low due to the networks activity, and Balancer's influence in the Fantom ecosystem.\n\nSpecifications\n\nThe DAO Multisig ftm: `0xFe2022da08d17ac8388F5bEFE4F71456255105A4` will call `addOwnerWithThreshold` on itself six times, with the `threshold` equal to `6` and the following new `owner` addresses:\n\n`0x7c2eA10D3e5922ba3bBBafa39Dc0677353D2AF17`\n`0xafFC70b81D54F229A5F50ec07e2c76D2AAAD07Ae`\n`0xc4591c41e01a7a654B5427f39Bbd1dEe5bD45D1D`\n`0x7019Be4E4eB74cA5F61224FeAf687d2b43998516`\n`0x11761c7b08287d9489CD84C04DF6852F5C07107b`\n`0xcf4fF1e03830D692F52EB094c52A5A6A2181Ab3F`\n\nThese can be confirmed via [bal_addresses](https://github.com/BalancerMaxis/bal_addresses/blob/4396ca6ee46272111bb6db65e5054af079e58dda/extras/signers.json#L2)\n\nThe DAO Multisig ftm: `0xFe2022da08d17ac8388F5bEFE4F71456255105A4` will then interact with the vesting contract `0x8D381EC09356C3F1805c54B2BB0867e8b417DC3a` calling `release` with the BEETS token address `0xF24Bcf4d1e507740041C9cFd2DddB29585aDCe1e` as the `token` argument. \n\nOnce the BEETS is received it will sent to the Maxi Multisig until further notice by calling `transfer` on `ftm:0xF24Bcf4d1e507740041C9cFd2DddB29585aDCe1e` with the recipient as `0x9ff471F9f98F42E5151C7855fD1b5aa906b1AF7e` and amount `10000000000000000000000000`",

        "body": "PR with Payload\nhttps://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/1405\n\n## Summary\nAs we get closer to the launch of Balancer v3, we propose having a Spearbit Cantina audit competition as the final security review before going live.  Cantina is known for having top notch security specialists reviewing and hardening novel codebases.  \n\nYou can view past competition [here](https://cantina.xyz/competitions), which include AAVE, Uniswap v4, Euler, and many other big names in the industry.  \n\n\nWe propose a prize pool of 250k USDC and $250k worth of BAL token to be allocated to the audit competition.  These audit competitions work by allocating a certain amount of capital across different vulnerability tiers, typically low, medium, high, and critical.  It is typical for the high and critical tier to have the most lucrative rewards.  If no vulnerabilities in a particular category are found, then that capital gets returned to the project.  This will be the last pass before going live with the protocol, so any vulnerabilities found would be vulnerabilities that would potentially go live, so think of this as a final bug bounty before live deployment.\n\nBalancer labs will be responsible for creating the conditions for each severity category and also any discretionary reward to out of scope yet deemed useful findings.  Any funds allocated to categories with no findings will be returned to the DAO. The contest will go for 3 weeks starting on October 15th.  \n\n## Specification:\n\nBalancer DAO will transfer 250k USDC and 115,250 BAL @ $2.17/BAL, which is a tad more than $250k USD worth of BAL.  An additional $15k in USDC will be rewarded to the unbiased judges of the competition, resulting in a total of 265k USDC.   \nThe recipient address can be confirmed in the cantina docs here:\nhttps://docs.cantina.xyz/cantina-docs/links\n\nBalancer DAO multisig `0x10a19e7ee7d7f8a52822f6817de8ea18204f2e4f` will call `transfer` on `0xa0b86991c6218b36c1d19d4a2e9eb0ce3606eb48` for \n265,000 USDC = `265000000000` to `0x3Dcb7CFbB431A11CAbb6f7F2296E2354f488Efc2` and will call `transfer` on BAL `0xba100000625a3754423978a60c9317c58a424e3d`\nfor 115,250 BAL = `115250000000000000000000` to `0x3Dcb7CFbB431A11CAbb6f7F2296E2354f488Efc2`",

        "body": "### PR with Payload\nhttps://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/630\n\nAcross supporting the Balancer token has been a huge success. So much so that the Across LP is nearly maxed out. This proposal asks the Balancer treasury to deposit another 40,000 BAL tokens into the Across LP (same size as initial deposit). \n\n**Motivation**: \nBalancer has 80k tokens that are stuck on Multichain and not useable for bridging. BAL token is not enabled on any other of the main 3rd party bridges (not canonical) for a meaningful amount of routes. Balancer team is pushing for more cross chain uses of the token and Across is the dominant bridge in being able to provide this service.\n\nHere is a graph of volume share between the canonical bridges (arbitrum, polygon, and base) and Across bridge over the last 100 days. You can see Across continues to gain share and it's currently 52% of the overall market vs canonical bridges!\n\n \n![bip-487-1.png](ipfs://bafkreigvvddueef7zmcvti3mwkohfasymi4d2lj4btrvavkq4agry3p5eq)\n    \n\nHere is the current state of the BAL pool on Across, 90% utilized and hence offering 12% to LPs via bridge fees paid. During this period of recent high utilization, the LP has attracted ~8k of BAL tokens from various participants. \n\n \n![bip-487-2.png](ipfs://bafkreibbavhpdf73dimcgaiezcsn4gabbx7sknqsaldfi3iuoutcalkylu)\n    \n\n**Specification**: \n\n1. Get HubPool address from https://github.com/across-protocol/contracts-v2/blob/master/deployments/deployments.json\n2. Approve HubPool contract to spend the right amount of BAL\n3. Call addLiquidity on the HubPool contract https://github.com/across-protocol/contracts-v2/blob/master/contracts/HubPool.sol#L454\n4. This will give LP tokens back\n\n### Technical Specifications\nThe Balancer DAO multisig `eth:0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4` will interact with the BAL token contract at `0xba100000625a3754423978a60c9317c58a424e3D` and call `approve` with amount `40000000000000000000000`. Then, the Balancer DAO multisig `eth:0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4` will interact with `0xc186fA914353c44b2E33eBE05f21846F1048bEda`, call `addLiquidity` with l1Token as `0xba100000625a3754423978a60c9317c58a424e3D` and `l1TokenAmount` as `40000000000000000000000`",

        "body": "https://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/193\n\n### Motivation\n\nSince the Maxi Q2 funding proposal gas prices on Ethereum have significantly increased. The course of our regular on-chain operations now easily consume more than half an ETH on a weekly basis. We've tried to cut some costs by offloading as much ethereum pool creation as possible onto third parties - zekraken even spun up this [simple UI](https://pool-creator.web.app/) to make that easier so balpy isn't required. That said, most things we do simply have to be done by us.\n\nAs this is becoming a more significant cost it's important to bring transparency to how this is being spent. We will commit to exploring a framework for reporting how gas is spent to the community - a dune dashboard is probably the ideal solution. If for some reason this is not possible some alternative will be presented in follow on funding requests. \n\nFor now we request 10 WETH from the treasury which we hope will last until the end of Q2. \n\n### Specification\n\nIf approved, the DAO Multisig `eth:0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` will transfer 10 WETH to the Maxi Operations safe `eth:0x166f54F44F271407f24AA1BE415a730035637325`",
