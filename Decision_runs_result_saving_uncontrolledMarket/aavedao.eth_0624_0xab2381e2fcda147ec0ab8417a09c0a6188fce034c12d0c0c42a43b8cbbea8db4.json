Our simulation engine has ingested the latest market data (outlined below) to recalibrate parameters for the Aave protocol. The community has aligned on a [Risk Off Framework](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/bafkreigdmcfmwvnxfolpds4xkdicgrszgmknig7pz2r2t37tltupdpyfu4) regarding lowering liquidation thresholds. \n\n\n## Motivation\n\n\nThis set of parameter updates seeks to maintain the overall risk tolerance of the protocol while making risk trade-offs between specific assets.\n\nGauntlet's parameter recommendations are driven by an optimization function that balances 3 core metrics: insolvencies, liquidations, and borrow usage. Parameter recommendations seek to optimize for this objective function. Our agent-based simulations use a wide array of varied input data that changes on a daily basis (including but not limited to asset volatility, asset correlation, asset collateral usage, DEX / CEX liquidity, trading volume, expected market impact of trades, and liquidator behavior). Gauntlet's simulations tease out complex relationships between these inputs that cannot be simply expressed as heuristics. As such, the input metrics we show below can help understand why some of the param recs have been made but should not be taken as the only reason for recommendation. The individual collateral pages on the [Gauntlet Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/aave) cover other key statistics and outputs from our simulations that can help with understanding interesting inputs and results related to our simulations. \n\nFor more details, please see [Gauntlet's Parameter Recommendation Methodology](https://medium.com/gauntlet-networks/gauntlets-parameter-recommendation-methodology-8591478a0c1c) and [Gauntlet's Model Methodology](https://medium.com/gauntlet-networks/gauntlets-model-methodology-ea150ff0bafd). \n\n\n\n### Supporting Data on Aave V3 Optimism\n\n**Top 30 borrowers’ aggregate positions**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/z2TdjKA.png)\n\n**Top 30 borrowers’ entire supply**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/XSupkvw.png)\n\n\n**Top 30 borrowers’ entire borrows**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/2QUPmL2.png)\n\n\n\n# Optimism Recs\n\n## Aave V3 Optimism Parameter Changes Specification\n\nGauntlet's simulation engine will continue to adjust risk parameters to maintain protocol market risk at reasonable levels while optimizing for capital efficiency. Our simulations show that we can improve the balance of risk and capital efficiency by lowering the liquidation bonus for WBTC and raising the liquidation bonus for sUSD on Optimism Aave v3.\n\n| Parameter | Current Value | Recommended Value |\n| -------- | -------- | -------- |\n|  WBTC Liquidation Bonus   |  10.0%    | 9.4%  |\n|  sUSD Liquidation Bonus   |   5.0%   | 5.4% |\n\n\n\n\n\n## Aave V3 Optimism Risk Dashboard\n\n\n\nThe community should use Gauntlet's [Aave V3 Optimism Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/aavev3_optimism) to understand better the updated parameter suggestions and general market risk in Aave V3 Optimism.\n\nValue at Risk represents the 95th percentile **insolvency value** that occurs from simulations we run over a range of volatilities to approximate a tail event. \n\nLiquidations at Risk represents the 95th percentile **liquidation volume** that occurs from simulations we run over a range of volatilities to approximate a tail event.\n\n### Aave V3 Optimism Dashboard\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/3Qn8k5v.png)\n\n\n\n*By approving this proposal, you agree that any services provided by Gauntlet shall be governed by the terms of service available at gauntlet.network/tos.*\n\n",

These parameter updates are a continuation of Gauntlet’s regular parameter recommendations. Our simulation engine has ingested the latest market data (outlined below) to recalibrate parameters for the Aave protocol. **Please note that this set of parameter changes will be lowering liquidation threshold for CRV.** The community has aligned on a [Risk Off Framework](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/bafkreigdmcfmwvnxfolpds4xkdicgrszgmknig7pz2r2t37tltupdpyfu4) regarding lowering liquidation thresholds. \n\n\n## Motivation\n\n\nThis set of parameter updates seeks to maintain the overall risk tolerance of the protocol while making risk trade-offs between specific assets.\n\nGauntlet's parameter recommendations are driven by an optimization function that balances 3 core metrics: insolvencies, liquidations, and borrow usage. Parameter recommendations seek to optimize for this objective function. Our agent-based simulations use a wide array of varied input data that changes on a daily basis (including but not limited to asset volatility, asset correlation, asset collateral usage, DEX / CEX liquidity, trading volume, expected market impact of trades, and liquidator behavior). Gauntlet's simulations tease out complex relationships between these inputs that cannot be simply expressed as heuristics. As such, the input metrics we show below can help understand why some of the param recs have been made but should not be taken as the only reason for recommendation. The individual collateral pages on the [Gauntlet Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/aave) cover other key statistics and outputs from our simulations that can help with understanding interesting inputs and results related to our simulations. \n\nFor more details, please see [Gauntlet's Parameter Recommendation Methodology](https://medium.com/gauntlet-networks/gauntlets-parameter-recommendation-methodology-8591478a0c1c) and [Gauntlet's Model Methodology](https://medium.com/gauntlet-networks/gauntlets-model-methodology-ea150ff0bafd). \n\n### Supporting Data on Aave V2\n\n**Top 30 non-recursive and partially-recursive aggregate positions**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/wNwliie.png)\n\n**Top 30 non-recursive and partially-recursive borrowers' entire supply**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/1t6xx1J.png)\n\n**Top 30 non-recursive and partially-recursive borrowers' entire borrows**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/AZIyE4A.png)\n\n\n\n\n\n**Top CRV non-recursive supplies and collateralization ratios:**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/pggzt0r.png)\n\n**Top DAI non-recursive supplies and collateralization ratios:**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/HBehpt2.png)\n\n**Top WBTC non-recursive supplies and collateralization ratios:**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/QHwW1K2.png)\n\n## Aave V2 Parameter Changes Specification\n\nGauntlet's simulation engine will continue to adjust risk parameters to maintain protocol market risk at safe levels while optimizing for capital efficiency.\n\n| Parameter | Current Value | Recommended Value |\n| -------- | -------- | -------- |\n| **CRV Liquidation Threshold**    | 64%     | ***61%***     |\n| CRV Liquidation Bonus    | 8.5%     | 8.0%     |\n| DAI Liquidation Threshold     | 85%     | 90%     |\n| WBTC Liquidation Threshold     | 75%     | 80%     |\n| WBTC Liquidation Bonus    | 6.5%     | 5.0%     |\n\n\n\n## Notable Accounts to Flag\n\nAs of 8/18/2022, the data shows that no accounts would be liquidated as a result of these parameter updates. This could change if prices move significantly. On a daily basis, up until this proposal is executed, we will check whether these parameter updates will cause any liquidations and update the community on this forum post.\n\n\n## Risk Dashboard\n\n\n\nThe community should use Gauntlet's [Aave V2 Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/aave) to understand better the updated parameter suggestions and general market risk in Aave V2.

        "body": "## Simple Summary\n\nA proposal to adjust five (5) total risk parameters, including Liquidation Threshold, Loan To Value, and Liquidation Bonus, across two (2) Aave V2 assets. \n\n\n\n## Abstract\n\nThis proposal is a batch update of risk parameters to align with the [Moderate risk level](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/QmT9T4Rfnh1Z2HYmMPXvtFotMK2vSxiXK8dKStg2b6n4gi) chosen by the Aave community. These parameter updates are a continuation of Gauntlet’s regular parameter recommendations. Our simulation engine has ingested the latest market data (outlined below) to recalibrate parameters for the Aave protocol. The community has aligned on a [Risk Off Framework](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/bafkreigdmcfmwvnxfolpds4xkdicgrszgmknig7pz2r2t37tltupdpyfu4) regarding lowering liquidation thresholds. \n\n\n\n\n## Motivation\n\n\nThis set of parameter updates seeks to maintain the overall risk tolerance of the protocol while making risk trade-offs between specific assets.\n\nGauntlet's parameter recommendations are driven by an optimization function that balances 3 core metrics: insolvencies, liquidations, and borrow usage. Parameter recommendations seek to optimize for this objective function. Our agent-based simulations use a wide array of varied input data that changes on a daily basis (including but not limited to asset volatility, asset correlation, asset collateral usage, DEX / CEX liquidity, trading volume, expected market impact of trades, and liquidator behavior). Gauntlet's simulations tease out complex relationships between these inputs that cannot be simply expressed as heuristics. As such, the input metrics we show below can help understand why some of the param recs have been made but should not be taken as the only reason for recommendation. The individual collateral pages on the [Gauntlet Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/aave) cover other key statistics and outputs from our simulations that can help with understanding interesting inputs and results related to our simulations. \n\nFor more details, please see [Gauntlet's Parameter Recommendation Methodology](https://medium.com/gauntlet-networks/gauntlets-parameter-recommendation-methodology-8591478a0c1c) and [Gauntlet's Model Methodology](https://medium.com/gauntlet-networks/gauntlets-model-methodology-ea150ff0bafd). \n\n### Supporting Data on Aave V2\n\n**Top 30 borrowers’ aggregate positions & borrow usages**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Shar1i3.png)\n\n**Top 30 borrowers’ entire supply**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/DcrG6hE.png)\n\n**Top 30 borrowers’ entire borrows**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/60LomXa.png)\n\n\n\n**Top STETH non-recursive supplies and collateralization ratios:**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/o2zzUVf.png)\n\n**Top WBTC non-recursive supplies and collateralization ratios:**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/JL3W7IP.png)\n\n\n\n## Aave V2 Parameter Changes Specification\n\nGauntlet's simulation engine will continue to adjust risk parameters to maintain protocol market risk at safe levels while optimizing for capital efficiency.\n\n| Parameter | Current Value | Recommended Value |\n| -------- | -------- | -------- |\n| STETH Liquidation Threshold     | 81%     | 83%     |\n| STETH Loan To Value     | 69%     | 72%     |\n| STETH Liquidation Bonus     | 7.5%     | 7%     |\n| WBTC Liquidation Threshold    | 80%     | 82%     |\n| WBTC Loan To Value     | 70%     | 72%     |\n\nWe have ingested the most recent Aave and market data, including user positions, prices, volatility, and liquidity for all assets, including stETH, WETH, and WBTC. We then ran simulations to stress test the protocol in times of high volatility.\n\nAs shown in the dashboard screenshot below, our simulations show that Aave can increase capital efficiency while decreasing the risk of bad debt using these parameterization recommendations.\n\n\n\n## Risk Dashboard\n\nThe community should use Gauntlet's [Aave V2 Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/aave) to understand better the updated parameter suggestions and general market risk in Aave V2. Gauntlet has also launched the [Aave Arc Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/aave_arc).\n\nValue at Risk represents the 95th percentile **insolvency value** that occurs from simulations we run over a range of volatilities to approximate a tail event. \n\nLiquidations at Risk represents the 95th percentile **liquidation volume** that occurs from simulations we run over a range of volatilities to approximate a tail event.\n\n### Aave V2 Dashboard\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/CGcOHWG.png)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Next Steps\n* Targeting an AIP on 2022-10-11\n\n## Quick Links\n[Analytics Dashboard](https://metabase.gauntlet.network/public/dashboard/f4930651-29be-4ff3-b664-a34462e286c5)\n[Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/aave)\n[Aave Arc Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/aave_arc)\n[Gauntlet Parameter Recommendation Methodology](https://medium.com/gauntlet-networks/gauntlets-parameter-recommendation-methodology-8591478a0c1c)\n[Gauntlet Model Methodology](https://medium.com/gauntlet-networks/gauntlets-model-methodology-ea150ff0bafd) \n\n\n*By approving this proposal, you agree that any services provided by Gauntlet shall be governed by the terms of service available at gauntlet.network/tos.*\n\n\n\n",

        "body": "\n## Simple Summary\n\nA proposal to adjust seven (7) total risk parameters, including Liquidation Threshold and Liquidation Bonus across four (4) Aave V2 assets. \n\n\n\n## Abstract\nThis proposal is a batch update of risk parameters to align with the [Moderate risk level](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/QmT9T4Rfnh1Z2HYmMPXvtFotMK2vSxiXK8dKStg2b6n4gi) chosen by the Aave community. These parameter updates are a continuation of Gauntlet’s regular parameter recommendations. Our simulation engine has ingested the latest market data (outlined below) to recalibrate parameters for the Aave protocol. **Please note that this set of parameter changes will be lowering liquidation threshold for CRV and ENJ.** The community has aligned on a [Risk Off Framework](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/bafkreigdmcfmwvnxfolpds4xkdicgrszgmknig7pz2r2t37tltupdpyfu4) regarding lowering liquidation thresholds. \n\n\n\n## Motivation\n\n\nThis set of parameter updates seeks to maintain the overall risk tolerance of the protocol while making risk trade-offs between specific assets.\n\nGauntlet's parameter recommendations are driven by an optimization function that balances 3 core metrics: insolvencies, liquidations, and borrow usage. Parameter recommendations seek to optimize for this objective function. Our agent-based simulations use a wide array of varied input data that changes on a daily basis (including but not limited to asset volatility, asset correlation, asset collateral usage, DEX / CEX liquidity, trading volume, expected market impact of trades, and liquidator behavior). Gauntlet's simulations tease out complex relationships between these inputs that cannot be simply expressed as heuristics. As such, the input metrics we show below can help understand why some of the param recs have been made but should not be taken as the only reason for recommendation. The individual collateral pages on the [Gauntlet Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/aave) cover other key statistics and outputs from our simulations that can help with understanding interesting inputs and results related to our simulations. \n\nFor more details, please see [Gauntlet's Parameter Recommendation Methodology](https://medium.com/gauntlet-networks/gauntlets-parameter-recommendation-methodology-8591478a0c1c) and [Gauntlet's Model Methodology](https://medium.com/gauntlet-networks/gauntlets-model-methodology-ea150ff0bafd). \n\n### Supporting Data on Aave V2\n\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/zW3mXLO.png)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/6AnD7kE.png)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/L5VsbrR.png)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**Top CRV non-recursive supplies and collateralization ratios:**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/8RwGtti.png)\n\n**Top DAI non-recursive supplies and collateralization ratios:**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Xo6pCby.png)\n\n**Top ENJ non-recursive supplies and collateralization ratios:**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/3SOtHAm.png)\n\n**Top LINK non-recursive supplies and collateralization ratios:**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/5wxtQRV.png)\n\n## Aave V2 Parameter Changes Specification\n\nGauntlet's simulation engine will continue to adjust risk parameters to maintain protocol market risk at safe levels while optimizing for capital efficiency.\n\n\n| Parameter | Current Value | Recommended Value |\n| -------- | -------- | -------- |\n| **CRV Liquidation Threshold**    | 65%     | ***64%***     |\n| DAI Liquidation Threshold     | 80%     | 85%     |\n| DAI Liquidation Bonus    | 5.0%     | 4.0%     |\n| **ENJ Liquidation Threshold**     | 70%     | ***67%***     |\n| ENJ Liquidation Bonus    | 6.5%     | 6.0%     |\n| LINK Liquidation Threshold     | 78%     | 83%     |\n| LINK Liquidation Bonus    | 6.3%     | 7.0%     |\n\n\nSee below volatility and exchange volume data from 07/01 to 08/03. These are valuable metrics to build intuition but are not the only inputs our simulations take into account to make parameter recommendations. \n\n|Symbol| 08-03 Volatility| 07-01 Volatility| Volatility Change| Weekly Average Daily Volume Change (%)  |\n| ------ | ---------------- | --------------- | ----------------- | ----------- |\n| CRV   | \t  1.47619713      |  1.778618025  | \t\t-0.302420895   |  77.315888   |\n| DAI    |  \t0.039068386     |   0.259962179   | \t-0.220893793    |  -50.4644256 |\n| ENJ    |   1.148617699     |  1.452206402      | -0.303588703|  \t25.9940047  |\n| LINK    |   0.910394357     |  1.650882468      | -0.740488111  |  \t23.1053197  |\n\n\n## Notable Accounts to Flag\n\nAs of 8/3/2022, the data shows that no accounts would be liquidated as a result of these parameter updates. This could change if prices move significantly. On a daily basis, up until this proposal is executed, we will check whether these parameter updates will cause any liquidations and update the community on the forum post.\n\n\n\n\n## Risk Dashboard\n\n\n\nThe community should use Gauntlet's [Aave V2 Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/aave) to understand better the updated parameter suggestions and general market risk in Aave V2. Gauntlet has also launched the [Aave Arc Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/aave_arc).\n\nValue at Risk represents the 95th percentile **insolvency value** that occurs from simulations we run over a range of volatilities to approximate a tail event. \n\nLiquidations at Risk represents the 95th percentile **liquidation volume** that occurs from simulations we run over a range of volatilities to approximate a tail event.\n\n### Aave V2 Dashboard\n\n\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/KkfStOO.png)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Next Steps\n* Targeting an AIP on 2022-08-09\n\n*By approving this proposal, you agree that any services provided by Gauntlet shall be governed by the terms of service available at gauntlet.network/tos.*\n\n",
