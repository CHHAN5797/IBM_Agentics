        "body": "# Summary\n\nAs continuation of the engagement finished 1st October, present to the Aave DAO a proposal for BGD to continue as provider of development and security coordinator services.\n\n\n# Motivation\n\nTime flies in DeFi, and it has already been two and a half years since BGD started working for the Aave DAO.\nDuring this time, the market has gone up and down, new protocols have appeared, and CEXes have fallen. But the Aave protocol remains, and, following almost any metric, it has grown.\n\nTogether with the work of other service providers, we want to believe our contribution has had an important role in both the stability of Aave (creating solid trust) and the growth itself, with tech enabling all new types of use cases while maintaining the highest standards of security.\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\nDuring the last 3 engagements between BGD Labs and the Aave DAO, all pieces of the Aave infrastructure have been worked on: the Aave protocol itself with new versions and maintaining the current ones, the Aave governance, bridging infrastructure, all rails for expansion to new networks and use cases, supporting non-technical contributors to maximise their value without being blocked by tech; basically everything.\n\nThe motivation/goal of this new engagement is:\n\n- Keep the stability and trust in the Aave technology.\n- Innovate responsibly on production systems.\n- Support all other non-tech contributors to the DAO, accelerating progress.\n\nIn summary, the same as before, but always striving for better.\n\n\n\n# Specification\n\n\n## Aave <> BGD Phase IV (continuous) scope\n\nThe scope of this Phase IV builds upon all previous phases, and as commented, is focused on continuous maintenance and development of the Aave ecosystem technical infrastructure, in combination with security coordination and support to other contributors.\n\nMore specifically, the services include the following:\n\n- **Propose improvements on top of the current Aave v3.2 production version**. This will include minimum a v3.3 and v3.4 versions, but with quite certainty, more.\n    \n    Additionally, we have several other ideas to improve the core protocol, which will be unveiled to the community as soon as the feasibility research is positive.\n    \n- **BGD will take back the scope of deploying to new networks and pool instances**. As commented on our Phase 3 final recap, we identified that having different entities on the deployment stage of Aave v3 creates more overhead than benefit. So we think for Phase IV it is more optimal to get the following entities involved in the activation procedures:\n    - BGD Labs will perform all the pre-governance proposal stages (deployment of required smart contracts, adaptation of all tooling, and development of the activation proposal itself).\n    - As it currently happens, Certora will review the on-chain governance proposal once submitted, in order to have redundancy.\n- **Maintain Aave Governance v3 and a.DI**. In this phase, the effort will be on improving the user interface owned by the Aave DAO, and on the a.DI side, increasing even more the visibility on the infrastructure (on https://adi.onaave.com/), streamlining upgrade procedures via governance proposals, and on-demand, enabling new paths and bridge providers.\n    \n    Additionally, with the rollups ecosystem evolving (e.g. ZK-based), we will once again evaluate the expansion of voting to other networks, an item we removed priority on the previous engagement as the return of resources investment was not there.\n    \n- **Aave bug bounty program**. After already close to 1 year of the Aave <> Immunefi bug bounty being active, we plan to make certain improvements to it. Same time, we will remain as reviewers, addressing all the submissions and the different stages until bounty payment.\n- **v2 further off-boarding**. At the beginning of the previous Phase 3, Aave v2 pools were still very meaningful instances of the protocol, both in size and usage. Currently, different off-boarding initiatives (both from us and other contributors) have reduced a lot the role of v2 in the ecosystem versus v3. During this engagement, we will proceed/support further proposals for off-boarding of v2, with the target being reaching a scenario where only very major assets stay (e.g. WETH, stETH, USDC, USDT), but everything else naturally gets finally migrated to v3.\n- **Focus on Aave Stewards and additional infrastructure delegation**. We believe the path of using what we name the Stewards pattern is most probably the future direction of Aave:\n    - The Aave Protocol (v3) is the base layer of smart contracts, enforcing the highest-order validations and general settlement logic. Decentralized, with only the Aave Governance having “super-admin” control.\n    - The protocol delegates operational/management functions to other smart contracts, the Stewards. These are highly constrained on-chain agents, that allow for faster and more optimal operations, but that can lose this power at any point if the Aave Governance decides so, and with low capacity to create any damage on the protocol.\n    - Currently, the Stewards are focused mainly on optimizing risk parameter updates, but we envision extending this pattern to multiple areas, for example, finance (a Finance Steward is in the advance stage by the treasury contributors).\n    \n    Our role in Stewards development will involve 1) defining an approach that is scalable enough for the current and future needs of the DAO 2) developing the core Steward contracts we believe require our involvement 3) if optimal, supporting other contributors to create their own Stewards, or modifying existing ones for the needs of the DAO.\n    \n- **Umbrella support post-release**. In Phase 3, we included a separate scope for the creation from scratch of Umbrella, a new version of the current Aave Safety Module. Scheduled to be released pretty soon, the project will require post-release support, mainly in the shape of:\n    - Supporting non-BGD contributors involved in all Umbrella operations, for example, regulation of incentives, and risk considerations like choosing correct targets.\n    - Improvements post-release.\n    - Iterating on tooling after the initial effort included with the previous Umbrella scope.\n- **Aave protocol security coordinator**. Same as in our previous engagement, this involves:\n    - Continuously evaluate technical risks for Aave.\n    - Address events involving any vulnerability affecting Aave. This includes also creating governance proposals if required.\n    - Act as technical support for the Aave Protocol and Governance Guardians: define and document plans of action, communicate with both of them whenever a reaction is needed, and also properly disclose to the community activity on Guardian.\n- **Aave proposals reviews**. We will review all governance proposals before they go on-chain, the same as we have been doing last year. This acts as the first layer of security and quality, minimizing any potential issue to be detected on the on-chain stage by Certora, on their line of contribution.\n- **Maintenance and improvement of all tooling of the Aave ecosystem**. During the previous phases, we created multiple tools and projects on the off-chain side of Aave, like Aave Address Book, the Aave Proposals repository, Aave Helpers, the Aave Config Engine and a myriad of others. During this new Phase, we will keep improving them and creating anything new needed.\n- **Analysis for candidate networks to activate Aave v3**. Even if the plan on the previous scope was to off-board network analysis, finally we decided to keep performing them ourselves, as the overhead of supporting another entity would not have been good resource allocation.\n    \n    In this new scope, we will continue performing this analysis.\n    \n\n\n---\n\n**DURATION**: same as with Phases II & III, 6 months: starting from the moment the previous engagement ended (1st October 2024) and lasting until 1st April 2025.\n\n**BUDGET**: 2’300’000 in stablecoins and 5’000 AAVE, 50% paid up-front and 50% streamed during the 6 months engagement.\n\n---\n\n\n## What is NOT part of both the scopes\n\nSimilar as on Phase 3, we want to be explicit on what is not included in our line of contribution:\n\n- We are a technical provider of the community, we don’t do any type of business development and/or growth, that should be responsibility of other parties.\n- We don’t do security reviews on major developments of other contributors. We offer our security advisory for minor projects solely benefiting the Aave DAO, but on bigger scopes (e.g. something like GHO), that is up to parties engaged specifically on security, like Certora. On our side, we only do a best-effort review if we deem it appropriate.\n- We will provide feedback on design of projects that we don’t lead only whenever the project is 1) of technical nature and 2) the final design is flagged as “ready” by the contributor. Given our expertise, we have pretty strong stand in architecture and design decisions, which can create conflicts if no framework is defined.\n- We only work on projects with TEMP CHECK Snapshot passed (e.g. reviews). With the activity on the DAO increasing day by day, unless a filtering of projects is applied, it is not really manageable for us to support any project in pre-TEMP CHECK stage, unless we identified a clear need from our side.\n- We are not running services on behalf of the DAO, we design them to be ran in a decentralised manner, or by parties with the proper role to do so. Any tool we decide to run on our infrastructure (e.g. hosting of one instance of the Aave Governance v3 interface) is our own decision, outside of the scope of engagement.\n- Very ad-hoc projects will depend on the pipeline of priority, and potentially will be budgeted/estimated independently, if we see they will have important implications on the scope that we need to fulfil and/or not fitting in this initial estimation. For example, any projects like Umbrella will be budgeted apart, and we don’t disclose them at the moment, due to being in feasibility research phase.\n\n\n# Terms of Service\n\nA formal Terms and Conditions document for the engagement for services between the Aave DAO and BGD Labs can be found [HERE](https://bgdlabs.com/aave-dao-tos).\n\n\nWe would like however to highlight again the same high-level points as on Phase 3, which we thing are very important for the ethos of the DAO:\n\n- **Major projects IP and licensing belongs to the Aave DAO**. As a service provider to a DAO like Aave, we have an obligation to defend the interests of our customer. For that reason, the core software (e.g. all on-chain smart contracts to be used by the DAO in production) we create during our engagement are licensed to the Aave DAO governance smart contracts. This applies but is not limited for example to new Aave v3 version, Aave Governance v3, a.DI or others; systems that we consider highly innovative and not only improve the efficiency of Aave, but increase the overall value of the technology owned by the DAO.\n    \n    To insist on the previous fundamental implication:\n    \n    - The Aave DAO is the sole owner of the intellectual property and licensing of those projects.\n    - It is entirely up to the DAO to decide how to use and/or commercialise them, not to BGD Labs.\n    - Our benefit from those projects is the fee we receive from the DAO for developing the software.\n    \n    Even if already doing it by commercialising all the different Aave products, we believe in the near future IP and licensing commercialisation is something the DAO should put focus on, at the same time common good infrastructure is released.\n    \n- **BGD doesn’t decide what gets activated/applied in Aave**. We create the software and the technical proposals to activate said software, but it is and will always be up to the DAO governance to decide if that software should be enabled in production.\n- **No software is flawless, but we pursue it**. Historically, no major problem has been detected on the developments we did for the DAO, but it is impossible to assure from our side that all software will be flawless. However, we have a firm compromise of always following solid security standards and procedures, to minimise any potential impact.\n- **We don’t work with competitors of the Aave DAO**. To do the type of work we do on Aave, the community should trust us as service provider. To avoid any type of conflict, we compromise to not work with any competitor of the Aave DAO for any type of financial gain.\n\n\n# Disclosures\n\nBGD Labs has no meaningful commercial relation with entities that could create any type conflict of interest on the scopes of this proposal.\nSimilar as during the previous years, the majority of our focus is on core development and security services on Aave (exclusive provider): we have absolutely no engagement with any entity that could be perceived as competitor of the Aave DAO and we will not during the duration of this Phase 4.\n\n\n# Next steps\n\nIf the outcome of this pre-approval Snapshot ARFC is positive, we will proceed with the final AIP on-chain proposal, which will act as binding agreement for services between the Aave DAO and BGD Labs",

        "body": "# Summary\nPresent to the Aave DAO a proposal for BGD to continue as provider of development services, after Phase 1 and 2.\n\n---\n---\n\n# 1. Motivation. Aave and BGD 1, 2….3\n\nMay 9th 2022, we presented Aave <> BGD Phase 1, a proposal for services to the DAO, covering a pretty extensive scope on the big majority of Aave sub-systems; development and security related.\n\nDuring the following 15 months, we [did or participated in dozens of projects](https://governance.aave.com/t/bgd-working-day-365/13033)  of technical nature for the Aave DAO, and more importantly, we set precedent that a model of a fully independent company providing services to a decentralised entity can work.\n\nSeptember 4th 2023, we presented Aave <> BGD Phase 2, with similar type of scope as Phase 1, but with slightly different objectives in mind: the technical foundation of the Aave DAO was pretty solid from Phase 1, and possible to iterate on top of it, with a more concrete scope.\nAdditionally, we set ourselves as a goal to study how to introduce extra technical parties to service specific needs of the DAO, helping more on the decentralisation of the organisation, but without disturbing operations and delivery.\n\nAlso, we proposed a way shorter engagement (6 months), which we thought was more optimal for the DAO to have capacity to manoeuvre. The outcome of this work can be found [HERE](https://governance.aave.com/t/bgd-aave-bored-ghosts-phase-2-recap/16791).\n\n\n\nWe think that our services to the DAO on both Phases had played a role on Aave staying in top of its category for years in so nascent field, and the Aave codebase being used in other products, accounting to close to 75% of total market share category.\n\nNow we present Phase 3, continuist, but with some important changes in terms of scope.\n\n---\n---\n\n# 2. Specification. Aave <> BGD Phase III. The scope\n\nThis time, we want to explicit divide our proposal in 2 different and explicit components, each one with its separate scope, budget and duration characteristics.\n\n## Scope 1. Aave technical maintenance, improvements, security coordination and tech advisory to the DAO\n\nThis scope is the continuist component historically performed by BGD for the DAO, and will be composed of the following items:\n\n- Maintain, improve and consolidate all the Aave tooling introduced in Phases I & II, including but not limited to Aave Address Book, Aave Helpers, Aave Proposals, Risk Stewards, Seatbelt and Killswitch.\n- Maintain and improve Aave Governance v3, a.DI and Aave Robot, together with the tooling surrounding them.\n    \n    The following new items will be delivered, consequence of the research done on Phase 2:\n    \n    - Extend coverage of voting networks to rollups, apart from the current Polygon PoS and Avalanche C-Chain.\n    - Allow voting with AAVE tokens held in non-Ethereum networks.\n    - Granular and generalised consensus rules for a.DI, together with different planned optimisations.\n- Propose further improvements on top of the upcoming Aave 3.1.\n- Different v3 maintenance tasks with important development requirements, including:\n    - Improve asset off-boarding procedures.\n    - Complete removal of stable debt logic.\n- Act as reviewers of Aave <> Immunefi for all current Aave ecosystem, not including GHO (Avara currently being the reviewer). Additionally, doing proper maintenance of the bug bounty program.\n- Act as security coordinator of the Aave ecosystem, including:\n    - Continuously evaluate potential technical risks for Aave.\n    - Design specific protection strategies in the event of any vulnerability affecting Aave.\n    - If arising, create governance proposals to mitigate any type of problem affecting Aave.\n    - Coordinate with the Aave Guardian for protective emergency actions.\n- Support with further technical off-boarding strategies for legacy versions of Aave (v1, v2) in a safe manner, both for the DAO and the users of the protocol.\n- Advise other contributors on which security procedures to apply for their developments, when required.\n- Evaluate new upcoming high-level technical implications/risks for the protocol, for example, new types of assets being listed.\n- Generally advise other contributors, whenever feedback from an entity expert on the Aave protocol is required. This includes but is not limited to contributors on the risk, treasury, security reviews and miscellaneous fields.\n- Review governance proposals on pre-onchain stage, not as a full security audit, but in order to verify that we don’t see any integration problem with Aave’s smart contracts and good practises.\n\n---\n\n*Scope 1. Aave technical maintenance, improvements, security coordination and tech advisory to the DAO*\n\n**DURATION**: same as with Phase 2, 6 months, starting from proposal execution.\n\n**BUDGET**: as some items are not included in the scope (more later), the budget has been reduced from Phase 2. 1’600’000 in stablecoins and 5’000 AAVE, 60% paid up-front and 40% streamed during the 6 months engagement.\n\n\n## What is NOT part of the scope\n\n- We are a technical provider of the community, we don’t do any type of business development and/or growth, that should be responsibility of other parties.\n- We don’t do security reviews on major developments of other contributors. We offer our security advisory for minor projects solely benefiting the Aave DAO, but on bigger scopes (e.g. something like GHO), that is up to parties engaged specifically on security, like Certora.\n- We will provide feedback on design of projects that we don’t lead only whenever the project is 1) of technical nature and 2) the final design is flagged as “ready” by the contributor.\nGiven our expertise, we have pretty strong stand in architecture and design decisions, which can create conflicts if no framework is defined.\n- We only work on projects with TEMP CHECK Snapshot passed (e.g. reviews). With the activity on the DAO increasing day by day, unless a filtering of projects is applied, it is not really manageable for us to support any project in pre-TEMP CHECK stage, unless we identified a clear need from our side.\n- We are not running services on behalf of the DAO, we design them to be ran in a decentralised manner, or by parties with the proper role to do so.\nAny tool we decide to run on our infrastructure (e.g. hosting of one instance of the Aave Governance v3 interface) is our own decision, outside of the scope of engagement.\n\n---\n---\n\n## Scope 2: Aave Safety Module - Code A\n\nAs commented before, we believe now the Aave DAO is in a really solid stage of their current systems, quite future-proof and ready to scale:\n\n- Aave v3 is a solid liquidity layer, on which is possible to iterate and improve.\n- Aave Governance v3 is probably the most advanced on-chain governance system in production.\n- a.DI is a totally generic bridging layer, that can be used for any cross-chain communication need on the Aave ecosystem, in a secure and scalable manner.\n- Aave Robot is a solid automation layer, integrated with Chainlink Automation, but flexible enough for any technology.\n\nMore in the line of innovative projects like Aave Governance v3, we propose to create a completely new system in an Aave component which requires improvement: the Aave Safety Module.\n\n\n### Aave Safety Module: Code A\n\nSafety Module Code A is the major project on the innovation side of this scope, but different to previous cases, our proposed approach is different: at the moment, we will not disclose a detailed description of it, as we think this is the right strategic approach for the DAO.\n\nHowever, we can say the following about Code A:\n\n- It will change completely the dynamics of the Safety Module and its components, including stkGHO, stkAAVE and stkABPT.\n- More efficient mechanism than the current.\n- Improved use experience.\n- Heavily improved dynamics for builders to build on top, but still batteries included.\n- Affecting importantly AAVE tokenomics.\n- Holistically designed, taking into account Aave v3 and GHO.\n- Directly/indirectly benefiting any future project of the DAO.\n\nWe are aware this requires some trust by the community on our research and execution capabilities (which is reflected on the payment schedule), but considering that the main beneficiary will be explicitly the DAO and our history of services, we think it is acceptable.\n\n---\n\n*Scope 2. Safety Module Code A*\n\n**DURATION**: this scope is not continuous like Scope 1, but our estimation is similar for full completion, approximately during the next 6 months to have everything fully ready and in production.\nHowever, delivery and communications will definitely be iterative, with extensive details of Project A to be disclosed in the first 2 months, and highly probably some of its components.\n\n**BUDGET**: 1’900’000 in stablecoins and 7’500 AAVE, with the following schedule:\n\n- 40% upfront.\n- 60% in a delayed payment in 4-months from now, when we estimate to be in good stage of completion.\n\n---\n---\n\n## Terms of Service\n\n- **Major projects IP and licensing belongs to the Aave DAO**. As a service provider to a DAO like Aave, we have an obligation to defend the interests of our customer. For that reason, the major software we have produced during our engagement have been licensed to the Aave DAO governance smart contracts. This applies but is not limited for example to Aave Governance v3, a.DI or others; systems that we consider highly innovative and not only improve the efficiency of Aave, but increase the overall value of the technology owned by the DAO.\n    \n    To insist on the previous fundamental implication: \n    \n    - The Aave DAO is the sole owner of the intellectual property and licensing of those projects.\n    - It is entirely up to the DAO to decide how to use and/or commercialise them, not to BGD Labs.\n    - Our benefit from those projects is the fee we receive from the DAO for developing the software.\n    \n    Even if other models can be explorer, from our point of view, this is a pretty solid contribution model for the innovation side of the DAO.\n    \n- **BGD doesn’t decide what gets activated/applied in Aave**. We create the software and the technical proposals to activate said software, but it is and will always be up to the DAO governance to decide if that software should be enabled in production.\n- **No software is flawless, but we pursue it**. Historically, no major problem has been detected on the developments we did for the DAO, but it is impossible to assure from our side that all software will be flawless. However, we have a firm compromise of always following solid security standards and procedures, to minimise any potential impact.\n\n---\n\n# 3. Next steps\n\nIf this ARFC Snapshot is positive, we will proceed with an on-chain governance proposal that will serve as formal and binding agreement for services between the Aave DAO and BGD Labs, on the terms defined.",

        "body": "# Summary\n\nProposal for the pre-approval of Aave v3.4, to authorise starting with the final development and security procedures before the final on-chain AIP activation vote.\n\n**As extra clarification, this approval only confirms a candidate set of features and changes, whose scope can only be reduced in AIP stage, not increased unless for bug fixing on production problems**.\n\nThe candidate changes are the following:\n- Migration of the custom GHO on v3 Core to a standard a/v Token, with no migration required by users.\n- Addition of Multi-call support on the Aave pool.\n- Introduction of a new Position Manager role, to a limited subset of actions, optionally configurable by every user.\n- Multiple code-size, gas, math precision, and miscellaneous optimisations.\n- Removal of the direct flash loan fee injection to suppliers to reduce liquidity index increase complexity, and overall, the security model of the protocol. Opening for the DAO to re-distribute the fees in an async manner with suppliers and/or Umbrella stakers protecting the asset.\n- Upgrading the core protocol smart contracts to Solidity 0.8.27.\n\n# Context\n\nThe development cycle of upgrades on a protocol like Aave is, by itself, full of nuances and strategic decisions. Sometimes, the upgrades are oriented to optimisation of the smart contracts infrastructure, and sometimes more oriented to enabling new features and improving in user/developer experience of the protocol.\n\nHistorically, the major “sub-versions” of Aave v3 focused on the following:\n\n- [**Aave v3.1**](https://governance.aave.com/t/bgd-aave-v3-1-and-aave-origin/17305). Infrastructural, very oriented to security improvements, with the introduction of virtual accounting and the deprecation of stable rate borrowing.\n- [**Aave v3.2**](https://governance.aave.com/t/bgd-aave-v3-2-liquid-emodes/19037). Feature-rich, focusing on the introduction of Liquid eModes, which radically changed the usage and configuration of assets listed on Aave pools.\n- [**Aave v3.3**](https://governance.aave.com/t/bgd-aave-v3-3-feat-umbrella/20129). Again, infrastructural, but this time focused on optimising liquidations and starting to account for bad debt accrued on the protocol (*deficit*).\n\nv3.4 is a bit of an exception, as it has a pretty good balance between UX/DevEx-oriented changes and infrastructure.  The rationale is that given the criticality of the liquidations component touched on in v3.3, we decided not to include certain features and optimisations we had in a very advanced stage of development and pack them together in v3.4.\n\n# Aave v3.4 candidate features\n\n\n## 1. Standardisation of a/v GHO tokens on v3 Core\n\nSince the listing of GHO on Aave v3 Ethereum as a directly mintable asset via a facilitator, we didn’t feel too comfortable with the approach, as it added certain complexity to the protocol.\nThis feeling got confirmed on the different upgrades of v3, as GHO became the permanent exception case that usually needed to be handled ad-hoc.\n\nHere is a quick summary on how GHO on Aave v3 Core Ethereum looks at the moment:\n\n- [*GHO aToken (aGHO)*](https://etherscan.io/address/0x2f32a274e02fa356423ce5e97a8e3155c1ac396b#code). It is a special implementation that has very little in common with other aTokens, more oriented to trigger various hooks on actions, instead of being an accounting/transferability layer. These inconsistencies materialise in a different utilisation model in the pool, the inability to flashloan GHO natively on Aave, and multiple other minor quirks.\n- [*GHO vToken (vGHO)*](https://etherscan.io/address/0x20cb2f303ede313e2cc44549ad8653a5e8c0050e#code). While superficially working similarly to standard vTokens, vGHO also has some special mechanics that lead to complexity and potential bug surface.\nIn contrast to other vTokens, the debt does not accrue as yield on the aToken (as aToken totalSupply is always 0), but instead accrues only on the vToken and is collected by the Aave Collector on repayment.\nThis behaviour is required in order to support the discount model, but adds again very important complexity, which, for example we noticed in practice when improving liquidations on the v3.3 release. Additionally, this adds overhead on the treasury management and peg control, as it creates the concepts of realised and non-realised GHO fees.\n- GHO on v3 Core is the only exception for an asset not using the virtual accounting introduced on v3.1, with no plans for this to change anytime in the future.\n\n\n### **GHO post-v3.4**\n\nOn this v3.4 proposal, GHO on v3 Core changes the following way:\n\n- The minting model will follow that of the Aave v3 Prime Ethereum with the [GhoDirectMinter](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-bgd-ghodirectminter/20040): a smart contract that can supply liquidity of GHO to the pool by minting it, but technically outside of Aave v3.\n- Different from currently on v3 Prime, and to not change the behaviour of GHO on Core, *only the  GhoDirectMinter will be able to supply liquidity of GHO on Aave*.\nThis will be achieved by having a 0 supply cap on GHO, which is skipped by the GhoDirectMinter exclusively. It opens to aGHO transfer scenarios (e.g., if the Collector could decide to transfer aGHO), but that should not create any issue.\n- The interest rate remains as it is, totally static (not based on utilisation), and changeable via governance and stewards.\n- aGHO yield accrual will work exactly as with any other aToken, continuously, and not only on repayment.\n- The native discount model is removed, as it can be achieved in the same way by having GHO rewards to specific vGHO/stkAAVE holders on top, with only very small differences on debt accrual dynamics, which in practice make no difference historically on GHO borrowing positions on Core.\nThe most natural option is following the anti-GHO approach approved on the new Aavenomics, for stkAAVE holders to get anti-GHO, which can be used to repay the GHO debt, factually being a discount. *Important to clarify that this will not be in sync with v3.4, with anti-gho potentially being released before or after*.\n- **No users’ migration of any type is required**. On the v3.4 upgrade, the GHO model of v3 Core will change under the hood, but all user positions will not be affected.\n\nThe benefits of these changes on the technical/security side are very important:\n\n- All reserves will have virtual accounting enabled, with no exception.\n- Related to v3.3 deficit management, burning bad debt no longer relies on special logic for GHO that discounts the protocol fee in some special cases.\n- GHO flashloans are enabled, eliminating the need for custom adapters, and in most cases making the flash-mint facilitator obsolete (but can be kept if the community wants).\n- Even if only affecting the GhoDirectMinter and the Collector in the average case, now for vGHO balanceOf(user) (similar to aGHO) will act as any other reserve, high-level being scaledBalanceOf(user) / normalizedDebt.\n- Umbrella will not need special handling of the GHO case.\n- Further changes on v3 will become way simpler.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Multicall support on the Aave Pool\n\nMulti-call support is the ability of a contract to allow native usage of multiple of its functions in one single transaction, one after the other. For example, being able to do supply + borrow, without requiring another contract on top doing under the hood the `Pool.supply` and then the `Pool.borrow`.\n\nThis has been a frequently requested feature on the Aave protocol; however, in previous iterations, we discarded it because we perceived extra complexity that we were not comfortable with.\nWith the type of non-invasive approach to multi-call we introduce on v3.4, we now think it really can bring all the value without compromising the security model of Aave v3 anyhow. Additionally, this will exponentially improve the experience post-v3.2 Liquid Emodes, opening to a myriad of new flows and use cases.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Aave Position Manager role\n\nWhen analysing the needs of different integrators after the release of Aave v3.2, it became clear that it could be important to allow a user to authorise a third-party to the following actions on its behalf:\n\n- Enable/disable an asset as collateral in the user position.\n- Enter an eMode (or switching from one to another).\n\nAave v3.4 introduces the concept of **Position Manager**, which has the following characteristics:\n\n- Any user can optionally configure one or multiple Position Manager addresses by calling the `approvePositionManager()` on the Aave v3 Pool. Same for removing authorisation.\n- These addresses will have the capability to do the previously commented actions on behalf of the user, with all protocol validations still applying as usual.\n\nThe Position Manager becomes especially interesting when combined with multi-call in the pool, opening ever more use-cases and flows.\n\n\n---\n\n\n## 4. Misc improvements and optimizations\n\n\n### 4.1. Removal of the “unbacked” concept\n\nUnbacked supply was part of a feature called Portals on the original Aave v3.0. Eventually, even if potentially useful, the feature was never used, but it occupies an important amount of contract size while also costing gas on most of the pool transactions.\nTherefore, in this version of the protocol, we decided to drop all the related logic to make room for other improvements. The feature might be added back in a future iteration if a use-case emerges and/or code-size becomes less of a concern(e.g. via Fusaka/EOF).\n\n\n### 4.2. Multiple configurations changed from variable to immutable\n\nOn the current v3.3 iteration of the protocol, there are multiple configurations defined as variables, but that historically have a “constant” nature.\nTo simplify the gas and reasoning models around them, v3.4 changes the following configurations from variable to immutable.\n\n- **Interest rate strategy address**. While all reserves *already* share the same interest rate strategy smart contract, in Aave v3.3, the strategy is still defined per reserve, which leads to one unnecessary storage read per touched reserve on user actions.\nGiven that there is no realistic need any time soon to change the interest rate strategy for only one asset but not for others, in Aave v3.4, one immutable variable `RESERVE_INTEREST_RATE_STRATEGY` was added to the `Pool` contract.\n- **Incentives controller address on a/v Tokens**. While all reserves *already* share the same Incentives Controlled address (the contract handling supply/borrow incentives), in Aave v3.3, the Incentives Controller was defined in state per token, which leads to unnecessary storage reads per touched reserve(s).\nThis had some historical reasoning of being able to customise rewards accounting contracts per asset, but it is a behaviour totally deprecated with no plans to appear any anytime soon.\nTherefore, in Aave v3.4, one immutable variable `REWARDS_CONTROLLER` was introduced on the `IncentivizedERC20` base class.\n- **Pool address on ProtocolDataProvider**. Up until now, the ProtocolDataProvider was doing a call `AddressesProvider.getPool()` to fetch any data, but given that the addresses provider and pool proxy pair will never change, it is way more optimal to simply make the pool reference on the data provider immutable, and this way adding extra gas savings across the board.\n- **Treasury address on aToken**. Currently, the treasury on each aToken is stored in storage, although it is the same for each aToken, even across pools in the same networks. This causes unnecessary storage reads on liquidations and mintToTreasury, with the first having high gas sensitivity. Therefore, in Aave 3.4, the treasury was moved to an immutable.\n\n\n### 4.3. Migration to Errors\n\nAave has historically used string error codes as opposed to `Error` signatures, because there was a preference for `require(cond, error)`, which did not support signatures in previous compiler versions.\nAs on Aave v3.4 the codebase was upgraded to solc 8.27, `require(cond, Error())` is now supported. This greatly improves UX, as explorers and simulations now show helpful errors opposed to cryptic numeric Error codes. At the same time, the change results in minor gas & codesize savings across the board.\n\nWhile this change could be **breaking** for anyone relying on exact error codes, it is important to note that:\n\n- Every single Aave release since v3.0 has had breaking changes in regards to error emission (either due to new Errors or the order of Errors)\n- We checked all the major integrations and did not find examples of people relying on *exact* error codes.\n\n\n### 4.4. Refinement of rounding/precision on user actions\n\nSimilar to the majority of protocols dealing with any type of mathematical operations on-chain, Aave v3 has certain inherent imprecision, generally affecting the order of magnitude of +/- 1 wei (last decimal).\nConsidering the extensive list of security procedures applied to Aave v3 over the years, we are confident this imprecision doesn’t pose any important problem.\n\nHowever, on v3.4 we are improving the rounding logic on user operations to follow the design approach of the protocol (and industry in general) of being more explicit rounding on the side of the protocol, as on the 4626 standard.\n\n\n### 4.5. Flash loan fees model simplification\n\nOn the Aave Pool and, more specifically, the flash loan feature, there is a fee which currently has 2 components:\n\n- The flash loan fee to the protocol `_flashLoanPremiumToProtocol`. The percentage of the total flash loan fee that goes as fees to the protocol Collector itself.\n- The flash loan fees to aToken holders (`_flashLoanPremiumTotal - _flashLoanPremiumToProtocol`). The percentage of the flash loan fee that gets automatically accrued into the liquidity index, so factually “spread” as yield amongst all suppliers.\n\nFrom a technical and security perspective, the model is sound and functional. However, the component of the flash loan fee going to suppliers creates a highly important consequence on the Aave system when looking from a fundamental point of view.\n\n\nIn Aave, yield/debt growth happens in practise by the so-called “indexes” (liquidity index, variable borrow index) increasing. Being a yield-oriented architecture, what is expected is that as debt gets accrued on the borrow side, the debt index increases, and this reflects on the liquidity index also increasing, to “forward” the yield from borrowers to aToken holders.\n\nHigh-level, this feels like it should be the only gateway for the liquidity index to increase, however, there is one single exception on Aave v3: the flash loan fee going to suppliers.\n\nAside from being the only exception, the mechanism of “injecting” the flash loan fee into the liquidity index of the aTokens is very different morphologically to yield accrual:\n\n- *It is “fast”*. It happens immediately during a flash loan, and there can be multiple “injections” of flash loan fees during the same block. In comparison, the increase of the index based on yield is “slow”, as it depends on the time passed and the interest rate.\nFor example, if an asset has a yearly 5% supply rate, the rate per Ethereum block is approximately 0.001%. However, one single flash loan of the whole liquidity available would be 0.05%, 50 times more, and that could potentially be repeated multiple times in the same block.\n- *It is quasi-unbounded*. Meaning that the higher the flashed amount, the higher the flash loan fee, and is only bound to available liquidity on the pool, which technically can be increased by supplying just before the flash loan.\n\nThese characteristics of the flash loan fee, and even considering countless other protections like virtual accounting, make the security profile of the flash loan feature more dangerous by default than yield accrual limited by time.\n\n\nBecause of the previous, on v3.4 we remove completely the component of flash loan fee going directly to suppliers, with the total flash loan premium becoming equal to the flash loan premium to the protocol.\n\nThe consequences of this are:\n\n- Yield accrual becomes the only “entry point” for liquidity index increase. **This is extremely valuable from both a security and a technical perspective**.\n- High-level assumptions don’t change significantly. The DAO can still spread to suppliers flash loan fees if required, just via other methods like on-chain rewards, Merit, or anything else.\n- The DAO can choose on top to spread rewards as incentives to the users that will carry the risk of the aTokens: Umbrella stakers.\n- Alternatively, the DAO can simply choose to completely zero the fee, but this would just be a separate configuration, not having any consequence on the codebase.\n\n\n### 4.6. Misc\n\n- Solc version used on the Aave protocol upgraded to 0.8.27.\n- Gas usage of `executeUseReserveAsCollateral` was greatly reduced by optimizing storage access.\n- Gas usage improved by shuffling `virtualUnderlyingBalance` into the position of pre-3.4 `unbacked`.\n- Minor code style improvements on `executeRepay`.\n- Usage of imported events from the interface contracts instead of re-declarations.\n- Skip unnecessary calculations on a subset of transfers.\n- *Self-liquidation is now forbidden (**BREAKING**)*. While this is a breaking change, it's unlikely to affect anyone, as there are essentially no on-chain traces of people relying on this functionality.\nThe rationale is that even if a user has monitoring capabilities/tooling to avoid liquidation, the optimal path is repaying with collateral (or just repaying), not self-liquidating.\n- SafeCast was upgraded from Open Zeppelin v4 to v5. The main difference is the usage of Error signatures, reducing the code size of various contracts.\n- VersionedInitializable now bricks the initializer on the implementation, so implementations no longer have to be initialized in order to prevent malicious initialization.\n- ScaledBalanceTokenBase changed the `.balance` storage from 128 to 120 bits. This was done to align storage across all tokens (currently on aAave on Ethereum mainnet uses 120 bits of storage), as 120 bits is more than enough.\n- Improved the accuracy and gas consumption of the `calculateCompoundedInterest` function without changing the formula.

        "body": "# Simple summary\nProposal for the community to pre-approve the final activation/configuration of SVR (Smart Value Recapture) oracles on a sub-set of Aave v3 Core Ethereum assets, a system created by Chainlink to recapture MEV from Aave liquidations and return it to the Aave ecosystem.\n\n# Context\nAs described in the [TEMP CHECK stage](https://snapshot.box/#/s:aave.eth/proposal/0x29721c3f2d61a793b310720ffd671fe349b4f9603f066e0f5644a40e59549b96), this proposal seeks the community’s approval to integrate Chainlink’s SVR v1 system. Extensive details about its rationale and specifications can be found on Snapshot and the associated governance forum.\n\nThis ARFC delves more into the proposed initial configuration details of the initial phase (Phase 1).\n\n# Specification\nTo recap, the architecture of the new Chainlink SVR feeds to be connected to Aave is as follows:![svr-diagram-arfc.jpg](ipfs://bafkreidkqa26w7eaqaq34a2fnaz6goy7acu6g36w4jy5byb5oqsmtdfl3q)\n\nIn the integration side of Aave, there are two major components to take into account:\n\n- **SVR Feed**. This will be the one plugged into the Aave Oracle smart contracts (with the necessary CAPO adapters on top if applicable), receiving the OEV-recapturing price on-chain.\n- **Fallback feed**. This is a mirror of the “standard” price feeds currently plugged into Aave, without OEV recapture. The SVR Feed has a configurable delay fallback in seconds: as both SVR and Fallback feeds get submitted to their respective mempools in parallel, whenever the OEV doesn’t reflect on-chain for more than the delay fallback seconds but the Fallback does, the price reading is routed to the Fallback feed.\n\nThe fallback mechanism is completely fundamental security-wise, as it gives one important assurance: on average, the price availability of the overall system will be equal to or superior to the current feeds, but even in the worst-case scenario, the maximum delay to read from a “standard” Chainlink feed will be of the configured delay fallback seconds.\n\n## Initial assets configuration: controlled approach\nEven considering that the technology (Chainlink, Flashbots) is battle-tested, and the protection mechanisms embedded into SVR like the fallback, we believe the rollout of feeds should be progressive, only enabling a very limited subset of assets on v3 Core Ethereum during the first month or so.\n\nFrom our discussions with Chainlink, we think the following principles for choosing the initial assets are reasonable:\n\n- The assets consuming the feeds should have a meaningful volume of historic liquidation.\n- The majority of liquidations happening on positions consuming the chosen feeds should be due to those feeds, and not due to other assets. E.g. in positions using AAVE as collateral and borrowing USDC, the majority of liquidations happen due to the AAVE/USD price feed updates on the collateral side, as the USDC/USD feed barely changes.\n- In this first activation batch, major assets size-wise should be avoided: ETH, wstETH, WBTC, weETH.\n- Ideally, we plug in production feeds that will affect assets correlated with major ones, but smaller in size. Both tBTC and WBTC use the hood of the same BTC/USD feed, but the first is ~$82m in size versus the second ~$3b.\n\nWith the previous principles in mind, and also taking into account the extensive testing/simulations performed by Chainlink in their infrastructure during the previous couple of months, the recommendation is to enable the following SVR feeds:\n\n- **BTC/USD affecting exclusively LBTC and tBTC**.\n- **AAVE/USD**.\n- **LINK/USD**.\n\n## Other configurations: fallback delay and its nuances\nWhen choosing specific values per asset for a fallback delay, there are different points of consideration:\n\n- The fallback delay is a mechanism that will not be used on the “happy” path: when the Chainlink DON submits prices to the Flashbots auction, historical analysis shows that the majority of price updates (and so liquidations) are included in the next block, and close to 100% in the range of 1-2 blocks. That means that price reading being redirected to the “public” feed will only happen if a fallback delay is configured to less than 2 blocks (in seconds), or in very edge scenarios when auction participants don’t show up for more than 2 blocks, even if economically sound.\n- Aside from the auction aforementioned average auction speed of 0-2 blocks, configuring too low (e.g. 2 blocks) the fallback delay opens to an edge, but theoretically existing censorship vector: it could be profitable for a builder with control to build the +2 block from next on the public mempool to censor the price update on the 2 blocks on the Flashbots auction, to wait for their to-be-mined block on the public mempool.\nAgain, this vector is very theoretical but technically exists whenever the fallback delay is very short. Any increase in the fallback delay configuration makes the censorship vector exponentially more expensive, as the cost of “capturing” multiple blocks in a row gets increasingly more expensive,\n- Aave is configured very conservatively risk-wise, which means that the difference of processing a liquidation in the same block of price update versus some blocks after doesn’t put the system at all at risk.\nThis will not really be the case on the average scenario of the price being included into the block via Flashbots, as it will precisely incentivise as fast as possible inclusion, but it is a consideration to not configure the fallback delay too tigh, avoiding any type of censorship attack, even if very theoretical.\n\nConsidering the previous rationale, and also using historical analysis from Chainlink showing that there will be no loss on the risk profile of the protocol, the recommendation is to set the fallback delay on BTC/USD, AAVE/USD and LINK/USD to 5 blocks.\nThe Aave DAO via its risk provider will reserve executive power over modifying this parameter by communicating to Chainlink.\n\n## Extra protection: SvrOracleSteward\nGiven the criticality of the infrastructure activation, and to be even extra cautious, we also propose to include a new steward smart contract: the SvrOracleSteward.\n\nThe SvrOracleSteward allows for the Aave Protocol Guardian to replace, on the Aave Oracle side, a feed (e.g. CAPO) consuming one the new SVR by exclusively one used before the SVR replacement. This way, even in the very unexpected worst-case scenario of the new SVR simply not being functional or having a really major issue, the Aave Protocol Guardian could immediately swap back to the standard price feeds currently used in production.\n\nWe don’t expect this mechanism to be used anyhow, but we think it is reasonable as an extra line of defense when enabling a pretty innovative system like SVR v1 Chainlink.\n\n## OEV-recaptured recipient\nWhen using systems like Flashbots for a case like this of SVR, it is necessary to define an address to receive the native currency (e.g. ETH) recapture. Ideally, the Aave DAO would have full control over this address, but in practice, as the Chainlink DON is the entity factually building the transaction and submitting it to Flashbots, they have control over configuring it or changing it.\n\nThe Aave protocol already has a RevenueSplitter smart contract to be used as OEV beneficiary, for any non-100%/0% split between Aave and Chainlink. But given that using it or not is a purely operational consideration (as still Chainlink can change it unilaterally), we will coordinate with them to decide whats the most reasonable venue.\n\nIn any scenario, the final recipient of the OEV fees should be the Aave Collector, and we consider mandatory that distribution to it happens minimum once a week, no matter if via RevenueSplitter or via transfer from the Chainlink side.\n\n## Aave/Chainlink fee split terms\n\nSimilar to any other terms of the Aave <> Chainlink SVR partnership, it is outside of the scope of this ARFC to define the percentage of a split between Aave and Chainlink on the OEV recapture, as we (BGD) are technical service providers, and the community should vote on the configuration separately from those.\nWe will abide by any decision approved by the DAO via ARFC, configuring any technical component accordingly.",

The current proposal is focused on implementing Aavenomics and is meant to be more concise than the TEMP CHECK for improved readability.\n\n### Introduction\n\nThe Aavenomics update TEMP CHECK was approved around six months ago, since then, the Aave protocol reinforced it’s leadership in the Defi vertical and became the #1 Defi protocol in general.\nAave's market share has increased every quarter for the past two years, and GHO crossed $200m supply with healthy revenue despite harsher market conditions at the end of Q1 2025.\n\nEvery triggering milestone for implementation has been met, and Aave successfully upgraded to Aave 3.3 recently, thanks to the relentless efforts of @bgdlabs.\n\nAave protocol revenue remains strong despite market conditions, and the \"cash\" portion of our Aave DAO has increased by 115% since the adoption of the Aavenomics TEMP CHECK—now sitting at $115M. This growth occurred despite having the largest budget in Aave DAO history, due to V4 financing to Aave Labs (half of the DAO service providers budget but “one-off” expense) and the Merit revenue sharing experiment (around 20% of the Aave DAO budget).\n\nWhile the downturn in interest rates affects the Aave DAO revenue, the protocol still maintains near-total dominance over revenue generated by lending protocols in the industry.\n\n### Expected growth of revenue in 2025\n\nHigh revenue and high cash reserves put Aave in a comfortable position to initiate the Aavenomics update, and current market conditions allow Aave to become even more competitive and gain market share. Most competitors do not have cash in hand to finance incentives, so they must rely on distributing their native assets; yield farmers are wary of holding these tokens and are more willing to exchange them for cash as token valuations decline in secondary markets.\n\nAave is the only current protocol with an impeccable reputation for quality, making it the natural choice for most DeFi users even when yields are equal to or slightly lower than competitors'. Additionally, the protocol has the cash reserves necessary to distribute incentives in high-quality assets—a luxury no one else can afford in the current industry environment.\n\nAave revenue is also expected to increase with the introduction of Chainlink-powered SVR, allowing the protocol to extract revenue while protecting users from bad debt in market downturns. This revenue—while difficult to predict since it's tied to market volatility that is inherently unpredictable—is expected to be significant (up to more than $10M/year) and can be mobilized to finance part of the Aavenomics.\n\nAnother exclusive Aave perk is Umbrella. With this new self-protection system, Aave will be the only protocol able to protect users from bad debt up to billions, as competitors have essentially given up on protecting their users. This unique advantage will make Aave even more attractive, especially for institutions concerned with on-chain risks.\n\nLastly, one \"unexpected\" side effect of Umbrella is the de facto commitment of liquidity that will remain in the protocol until cooldown maturity. This will secure liquidity, make potential bank run events less harmful, and, more importantly, can be mobilized to build new products and revenue streams around this \"committed liquidity.\" Examples include cross-chain position financing and \"restacking\" of Aave committed liquidity for the safety of third-party protocols. Aave is well-armed to enter this strategic DeFi vertical and generate significant new revenues from it.\n\n### Creation of the Aave Finance Committee and Umbrella focus\n\nWe propose utilizing Umbrella as both a protective mechanism for Aave users and a growth tool by redistributing part of the Aave DAO excess revenue to Umbrella aToken stakers. We also recognize a strategic opportunity in the L2 landscape to mobilize revenue from existing networks toward L2s that are most strategic for Aave's growth.\n\nFor implementation, we propose mobilizing the talent of current Aave DAO service providers to form an Aave Finance Committee (AFC). This committee will be tasked with managing Aave collector contract holdings and defining the Umbrella liquidity target ratios and budgets tailored for both safety and growth. We propose founding members who equally represent risk, growth, and treasury management, with a 3/4 signature threshold.\n\nBy definition, the committee needs to be reactive to market conditions. Implementing every change on every network via AIPs is not compatible with efficient management. Therefore, we suggest that part of the AFC's mandate execution stems from token approvals done by Tokenlogic during their monthly treasury management AIPs, which will allow the committee to pull and distribute budgets as needed.\n\nThis approach will also simplify implementation, as some L2 revenue is expected to be spent on other, more strategic L2s.\n\nWhile cross-chain bridging by AIPs is theoretically possible (and done regularly between Avalanche, Polygon & Mainnet), it remains inefficient. This is why a new Bridge Steward connecting Collectors contracts on all networks is required, and Bgd Labs will propose one shortly. This will allow Treasury management AIPs to be slightly less complex and more focused on swapping major assets and delivering token approvals, making the risk surface thinner and review more seamless.\n\nWe suggest mandating both Tokenlogic and ACI to lead this AFC under the supervision and control of risk service providers who can block any potential collusion between them.\n\n### Umbrella Asset Focus\n\nFor efficiency and to reflect which tokens are the most strategic, borrowed and in need of Umbrella protection, we suggest focusing Umbrella on the following assets:\n\n- wETH\n- USDC\n- USDT\n- GHO (via StkGHO)\n\nAnd when needed native assets to be defined separately such as wAVAX, wS, GNO\n\n### Rewards Distribution Tokens\n\nFor rewards tokens, we suggest the following tokens:\n\nSourced from RF collection:\n\n- wETH\n- USDC\n- USDT\n\nSourced from the Ecosystem reserve\n\n- AAVE\n\nand if available, third-party funded incentives budgets.\n\n### Network Implementation\n\nWe suggest activating Umbrella on the following networks:\n\n- Ethereum Mainnet, Core & Prime instances\n- Avalanche Network\n- Sonic\n- Arbitrum\n- Gnosis\n- Base\n\n### Aave Finance Committee funding members\n\n- Chaos Labs\n- Tokenlogic\n- Llamarisk\n- ACI\n\n## AAVE secondary liquidity management\n\nThe Aave DAO currently allocates a significant portion of the Ecosystem Reserve—approximately $27 million per year at current AAVE valuation—to secondary liquidity incentives. While AAVE's secondary liquidity remains critical for the protocol, the Umbrella upgrade has rendered the old Safety Module ready for deprecation in favor of a more efficient system.\n\nWe believe we can achieve the same or even greater amounts of secondary liquidity for AAVE at a fraction of the current budget. Since one of the main goals of the Aavenomics global project is to eventually have the DAO source all AAVE distribution through secondary market buybacks, maintaining tight control over spending efficiency is crucial.\n\nTherefore, we propose gradually complementing the current StkBPT staking with a hybrid system. This new approach will continue to leverage StkBPT staking while allocating part of the budget to the current Aave Liquidity Committee (ALC). This will enable the committee to take a more hands-on approach to shaping secondary liquidity for the AAVE token. To implement this, the proposal seeks governance approval to grant the ALC a mandate for AAVE token allowance from the Ecosystem reserve, enabling them to define budgets and distribute rewards efficiently—similar to what has been achieved with GHO.\n\n### Close the LEND chapter\n\nAs announced multiple times over the past years and nearly half a decade after opening the LEND to AAVE migration contract, it's time to close the LEND chapter and focus on AAVE.\n\nThis proposal will remove all remaining AAVE—320k tokens at the time of writing—from the migration contract and redirect them to the ecosystem reserve.\n\nGiven that the community has had multiple years of notice, we consider it fair to close down the migration process. These long-dormant funds (approximately $65M at current AAVE price) will then be available to the DAO to be mobilized for growth, safety, or burn proposals by governance.\n\n### Protocol excess revenue for AAVE stakers\n\nThe previous elements of this proposal will impact the Aave DAO budget, yet they are not expected to significantly harm Aave protocol excess revenue. Furthermore, the growth anticipated from updates, new products, and our substantial current cash reserves makes us confident that we can initiate and maintain a \"Buy and distribute\" program, even in the face of recent unfavorable market conditions.\n\nThe protocol has already successfully implemented and maintained a revenue redistribution program in the form of Merit for more than a year, distributing $12m/year of protocol revenue to GHO stakers at current GHO borrow rates and supply. This program is now self-sufficient and no longer financed by revenue from third-party stables, making the \"Merit is forever\" meme a strong reality.\n\nIt's now time to increase our ambitions to match the current protocol economy and upgrade both StkAAVE & StkBPT tokenomics. This will enhance rewards to Aave ecosystem stakers with excess protocol revenue.\n\n### Creation of Anti-GHO\n\nThe \"anti-GHO\" name derives from \"anti-matter.\" Anti-GHO is a non-transferable ERC20 token generated by AAVE and StkBPT Stakers. It is produced linearly through the Merit/MASIv system, with boosts and diluters applied, and is claimable bi-weekly by all Aave stakers.\n\nAnti-GHO can be used in two ways:\n\n- Burned at a 1:1 ratio against GHO debt in the protocol (hence the \"anti-GHO\" name), allowing users to reduce their GHO debt in Aave at no extra cost\n- Converted to StkGHO, which is fully eligible for Merit & other Aave incentives, and after cooldown, convertible to GHO\n\nAnti-GHO is designed to fully deprecate and replace the current GHO discount. This represents a leap forward in excess revenue distribution, as the GHO discount was only available to StkAAVE stakers who also had GHO debt in the protocol, whereas Anti-GHO will be generated by all AAVE and StkBPT Stakers.\n\nThe Anti-GHO budget stems from GHO revenue generation by the protocol and scales linearly with it. A governance-defined percentage of all GHO facilitators' revenue is dedicated to minting and distributing Anti-GHO. These parameters will adjust in line with the actual protocol economy, making it both a sustainable and scalable budget tied to Aave's success.\n\nThe current large DAO cash reserve provides the protocol with a comfortable buffer to maintain Merit rewards on top of Anti-GHO generation, even if the protocol economy faces pressure from a cyclical industry \"bear\" downturn.\n\nWe propose setting the initial parameters of Anti-GHO generation at 50% of GHO revenue. At the time of writing, the GHO supply is 186M generating a 6.45% (non-discount) yield; therefore, GHO revenue is currently at $12M/year. The current proposal would generate 6M anti-GHO/year for Aave stakers.\n\nWe propose distributing 80% of anti-GHO rewards to StkAAVE holders and 20% to StkBPT holders.\n\nAny slight deficit in the GHO balance sheet due to Merit & ALC budgets will be financed with excess revenue from other stablecoins in the Aave protocol, with the clear goal of reaching GHO sustainability and profitability in 2025.\n\n### AAVE Buy and Distribute program\n\nThe protocol still has substantial AAVE reserves. The closing of the LEND chapter will significantly contribute to these reserves. Nevertheless, we believe it's crucial to begin the journey toward long-term sustainability of the DAO's AAVE budget.\n\nThis proposal gives mandate to Tokenlogic to provide token approvals to the AFC during their monthly treasury management AIPs, allowing the AFC to execute and/or work with market makers to buy AAVE tokens on secondary markets and distribute them to the ecosystem reserve.\n\nAfter the initial six-month period, Tokenlogic will include a quarterly buyback budget in their treasury management reports. They will size these buybacks according to the protocol's overall budget, with the objective to eventually match—and even surpass—all protocol AAVE spending. These budgets will then be converted into token approvals for the AFC to execute the buybacks.\n\nDuring the Aavenomics TEMP CHECK phase, it was stated that a conservative approach would be to always keep in the collector's contracts an amount equivalent to 2× the \"OPEX\" or Aave service providers' & incentives budget for the DAO to mitigate treasury risk in case of a prolonged market downturn and reduced protocol revenue.\n\nThe service providers' budget is expected to evolve in 2025. Half of the 2024 budget went to support Aave Labs for the creation of V4—this large investment is not meant to be renewed in 2025. While we expect some compensation inflation from other service providers, we believe a $40–45M total budget (outside umbrella & buyback financing) is a credible conservative higher range scenario for the 2025 budget.\n\nWhile staying extremely conservative with Aave treasury funds, the ACI considers this proposal can mandate the AFC to **start an AAVE buyback and distribute program immediately at the pace of $1M/week for the first 6 months of the mandate**. With new upcoming revenue during 2025 from various sources, the AFC will likely be able to increase the buyback budget via a subsequent proposal.\n\nTokenlogic has a mandate to define the tokens used to finance these buybacks according to Aave treasury holdings on a month-to-month basis.\n\n## Specification\n\nThis proposal can largely be executed in a single AIP, though not entirely. It provides an official mandate for committee creation and expands the ALC's scope. Execution will continue through Treasury management AIPs and AFC execution. However, ending the GHO discount and implementing Anti-GHO might require additional development and audit time depending on service providers' feedback. These elements will likely be implemented in a separate \"Aavenomics Part Two\" proposal.\n\nThe specification for this first part of the Aavenomics implementation includes the following key technical components:\n\n### Technical Implementation Details\n\n1. **Aave Finance Committee Creation**: Establish a 4-member committee with a 3/4 signature threshold consisting of Chaos Labs, Tokenlogic, Llamarisk, and ACI. \n2. Give mandate to Tokenlogic to implement financing of the proposed budget for the first 6 months of the Aavenomics via monthly treasury management proposals and setting token approval allowances.\n3. **AAVE Secondary Liquidity Restructuring**: Gradually reduce the current StkBPT rewards in favor of a hybrid approach combining StkBPT staking (with no slashing element) with defined liquidity targets and partial budget allocation and distribution via AIP allowances dedicated monthly to the Liquidity Committee.\n4. **Protocol Revenue Redistribution**: Deprecate the current StkAAVE slashing element entirely, maintain AAVE rewards, and implement a system to distribute 50% of GHO protocol revenue to StkAAVE & StkBPT stakers using the Merit/MASIv framework with Anti-GHO. Anti-GHO will be distributed monthly in sync with Merit Rewards.\n5. **Buy and Distribute Program**: Mandate the AFC to leverage Treasury management token allowances to acquire AAVE on secondary markets and/or through MM partners, then send acquired tokens to the ecosystem reserve. The program will start with a $1M/week AAVE acquisition for the first 6 months, after which it will be sized according to the overall protocol budget with quarterly reporting.\n\nAccording to service provider feedback, especially @bgdlab, this might be implemented during an \"Aavenomics Part Two\" proposal to allow time for development and audit of these new features.\n\n1. **Anti-GHO Implementation**: Create a non-transferable ERC20 token that:\n    - Is generated by AAVE Umbrella Stakers through the Merit/MASIv system\n    - Can be burned at a 1:1 ratio against GHO debt\n    - Can be converted to StkGHO (eligible for Merit & other incentives)\n    - Will replace the current GHO discount mechanism\n  \n2. **LEND Migration Closure**: Remove all remaining AAVE from the LEND migration contract and redirect these tokens to the ecosystem reserve, formally ending the migration process after nearly five years.\n\nThe key objectives of these specifications are to optimize the DAO's AAVE distribution, improve secondary liquidity management efficiency, formalize the LEND deprecation, implement a sustainable revenue distribution model, and establish a pathway toward long-term sustainability of the DAO's AAVE budget.\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThe ACI and its team hold significant staked and unstaked GHO and AAVE positions and will directly benefit from this AIP alongside, and equally to, all GHO and AAVE holders.\n\nThe ACI is not presenting this ARFC on behalf of any third party and is not compensated for creating this ARFC.\n\n### **Acknowledgments**\n\nThe ACI extends its sincere gratitude to all Aave service providers, delegates, and community members who contributed to this proposal's peer review. Your expertise and insights have been invaluable in refining and strengthening this proposal. Special thanks to @BgdLabs for their crucial input on this proposal and the conception of the Umbrella Safety module. This proposal reflects the collaborative spirit and dedication of the Aave DAO.\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. Invite community & service providers to provide feedback on this proposal with the goal of reaching consensus.\n2. If consensus is reached on this ARFC, escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n3. If the Snapshot outcome is YAE, give a mandate for the creation of committees, increase the scope of the current ones, and implement the rest of the proposal via AIP.\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.\n\n![image|1280x776](upload://j3cVg2xqAr1ArEjmQTZxrbgjfCB.jpeg)",
