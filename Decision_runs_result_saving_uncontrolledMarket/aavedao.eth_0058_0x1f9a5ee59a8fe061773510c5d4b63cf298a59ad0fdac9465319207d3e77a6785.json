        "body": "# [TEMP CHECK] GHO Aave Savings Upgrade\n\n---\n\n**title: [TEMP CHECK] GHO Aave Savings Upgrade**\n**author: @TokenLogic @ACI**\n**created: 2025-03-04**\n\n---\n\n# Summary\n\nThis proposal seeks governance feedback and consensus for creating sGHO and defining the Aave Savings Rate (ASR).\n\n# Motivation\n\nAave's GHO stablecoin is growing strongly during 2025 and is the [20th largest stablecoin](https://defillama.com/stablecoins). Whilst growth to date has been strong, growing from 200M to over 300M presents a different set of challenges requiring a different approach.\n\nTo date, stkGHO launched by @ACI, rewards users for contributing to the protocol's security, has been instrumental to GHO's growth journey and currently represents 67% of GHO's circulating supply. After the Umbrella upgrade, stkGHO will remain vital to Aave Protocol's security and is expected to transition towards a size reflective of the protocol's security needs.\n\nBy sizing stkGHO to reflect the Aave Protocol's security needs, this creates an opportunity for Aave to offer a variety of risk profile yield products. This presents an opportunity for the Aave DAO to introduce a new low risk profile saving product that is expected to lead the next chapter of GHO's growth and adoption.\n\nIntroducing sGHO, a low risk savings product that rewards users for staking GHO by earning the Aave Savings Rate (ASR), that compounds over time.\n\n# sGHO\n\nBy depositing GHO into sGHO, users will earn the Aave Savings Rate by holding an ERC-20 receipt token accruing value over time which is easily integrated with other protocols.\n\nsGHO is to be sustained from revenue generated by Aave Protocol and is specifically designed to have the lowest risk profile of Aave DAO's yield product offering.\n\nThe below outlines key benefits of sGHO's design:\n\n* Interest compounding Aave Savings Rate;\n* No rehypothecation providing instance liquidity;\n* Minimal smart contract risk surface area; and,\n* No Deposit or Withdrawal Fees.\n\nA configurable Aave Savings Rate provides the DAO with sufficient flexibility to offer either a fixed or variable savings rate that moves with the broader market conditions.\n\n## Re-hypothecation\n\nTo minimise risk, deposited GHO will remain in the sGHO contract and shall not be deployed to generated yield. This ensures liquidity is always available for users to withdraw and users are not exposed to any protocol risk.\n\nWhilst depositing GHO held within sGHO appears to be the most capital efficient path, this introduces some exit liquidity risks whereby GHO deposited into a protocol can be borrowed by another user. By using a facilitator to Mint and deposit GHO into the yield source, the same capital efficiency upside can be acheived in a more controlled manner.\n\n## Facilitator\n\nWith sGHO expected to create substantial demand for GHO, facilitators are to provide liquidity for user to access GHO. stataGSMs are to provide GHO liquidity via aggregators to avoid GHO deviating from peg whilst other facilitators support GHO being borrowed into circulating supply.\n\nNew Facilitator(s) can Mint and deploy GHO to earn yield. In doing so, rather than deploying GHO held within the sGHO contract, GHO can be Minted and deployed in a controlled manner by the Gho Stewards. This approach preserves the utilisation of liquidity within reserves enabling it to be optimised for achieving a intended borrow rate and maintaining the peg.\n\nFurthermore, Minting GHO via a facilitator increases GHO circulating supply when borrowed. Overal, this approach is similar to how the Gho Stewards manage GHO and how Sky manages USDS on the Prime instance.\n\nThe process of depoloying any additional GHO facilitator(s) is controlled by DAO governance and will be handled separately to this proposal.\n\n## Supply Cap\n\nWith each unit of sGHO being minted, the Aave DAO provides a defined amount of yield that extends the DAOs financial outlay. In isolation, as the portion of GHO held by sGHO increases, the revenue derived from GHO is distributed across the larger sGHO holding base results in either the Aave Savings Rate being revised lower, or requiring additional funding to sustain the savings rate.\n\nTo facilitate processing large withdrawals from sGHO and users exchanging GHO to another asset, DEX liquidity and GSM holding balances are key to sustaining the peg. With these interwoven co-dependencies in place, a Supply Cap on sGHO is proposed. The sGHO `Supply Cap` will be maintained by the Gho Stewards.\n\n## Fees\n\nTo enhance the user experience, there are no deposit or withdrawal fees applied to sGHO. Being a yield product, creating friction via fees would act to reduce the appeal of the offering placing sGHO at a disadvantage to similar offerings available in the market.\n\n# Introductin Aave Savings Rate\n\nBefore reading on, a brief recap of some key terms referenced within.\n\ni) `Deposit Yield` = `Incentive Yield` + `Native Yield`\n\nWhere,\n\n`Incentive Yield` = Yield derived from incentives, commonly referred to as LM rewards.\n`Native Yield` = Yield derived from fees native to Aave Protocol.\n`Deposit Yield` = Total Yield user receives.\n\nAcross Aave Protocol there are two dominant stablecoins, USDC by Circle and USDT by Tether. USDT is the largest, with an emerging trend of some networks preferring to favour one stablecoin over another. Two fast growing networks, Base and Sonic both exhibit a clear bias for USDC over USDT, of which Base has generated substantial growth for Aave Protocol in recent months.\n\nWhen comparing the Native Yield of USDC and USDT across variaous instances Aave Protocol, USDC was found to exhibit a less volatile and more consistent Native Yield relative to USDT. USDC offers both strong market correlation and lower volaility relative to USDT, both are favourable qaulities for deriving a market correlated savings rate.\n\nThe chart below shows USDT and USDC Native yield across Core instances on Ethereum, Arbitrum, Avalanche, Base and Optimism.\n\n![Screenshot 2025-02-18 at 19.11.02](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/r1tM3LGc1l.png)\n\nWhen specifically comparing USDT to USDC, the chart below provides a clear visual reflecting USDCs smoother Native yield profile relative to USDT.\n\n![Screenshot 2025-02-18 at 19.15.58](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/H1AOhUMqyx.png)\n\nThe Core instance of Aave v3 on Ethereum offers the deepest USDC liquidity and for this reason, the Aave Savings Rate incorporated the USDC Native Yield Rate from the Core instance on Etheruem as its preferred `Index Rate` .\n\nThe Aave Savings Rate definition:\n\n`Aave Savings Rate` = `Amp` x `Index Rate` + `Premium`\n\nWhere,\n\n`Index Rate` = Representative of market conditions\n`Amp` = Amplification Factor\n`Premium` = Nominal Amount\n\nA linear function provides sufficient flexibility to curate the yield to be either variable or fixed and to change the `Index Rate` to which the Aave Savings Rate is correlated to. The `Amp` can be adjusted to offset periods of low USDC utilisation, whilst the `Premium` allows for a discrete amount of extra relative yield to be applied.\n\nWhilst the Aave Savings Rate is expected to exceed the GHO Borrow Rate, the differential is to be managed such that it encourages adoption whilst being insufficent to promote arbitrage.\n\n# Beyond 200M GHO Growth Phase\n\nsGHO is the next step towards realising GHO's longer term growth potential, and with a very well capitalised balance sheet, Aave can accelerate the next chapter of GHO's growth potential.\n\nThe introduction of the Aave Savings Rate is expected to stimulate demand for GHO that will initially improve the peg and then lead to new GHO entering circulating supply via the stataToken GSMs. During the early growth phase for GHO, significant traction was achieved by aggressively incentivising growth and then tapering rewards to retain the growth.\n\nAave DAO is in a very fortunate financial position that is supportive of pursuing an aggressive growth strategy that captures the upside during what is a depressed yield market relative to late Q4, 2024. Launching sGHO with a premium to other similar savings products is expected to lead to significant growth whilst balancing the yield profile as to not overly encourage arbitraging the GHO Borrow Rate and Aave Savings Rate.\n\nThe chart below shows sUSDe, SSR, USDC Native Yield and USDS Deposit Yield on Core instance.\n\n![Screenshot 2025-03-02 at 16.08.50](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SJloMWzjyl.png)\n\nIn terms of risk profile, sGHO is most similar to sUSDS offering from the Sky Ecosystem. For sGHO to compete, given its relative size, a premium would be required to attract meaningful amounts of capital. The USDS Deposit Yield realtive to the SSR highlights the premium for introducing Aave Protocol risk and the utility of being collateral.\n\nOn a risk adjusted basis, the Aave Savings Rate used for sGHO would fall somewhere between the SSR and USDS Deposit Yield on Aave from a competition for capital perspective.\n\nFurther details on the precise Aave Savings Rate to be used when sGHO launches will be provided in the ARFC stage of the governance process.\n\n# Sustainability\n\nDuring the expansion phase, the Aave Savings Rate is expected to present an appealing interest rate that exceeds the GHO Borrow Rate and the Native Rate of the assets held within the stataGSMs. Especially during the early growth stage, the overal economic balance of GHO revenue and costs is going to be heavily shaped by the proportion of GHO's circulating supply deposited in sGHO.\n\nThe below highlights current and near term GHO revenue sources:\n\n* GHO Borrowed via Core instance;\n* stataToken GSM holdings; and,\n* Facilitator liquidity deposits.\n\nBorrowing GHO that has been minted by a facilitor, generates revenue for the DAO through either Borrow Interest like on Core or Native Yield plus Reserve Factor fees as on Prime.\n\n## stkGHO\n\nLonger term, right sizing stkGHO reflecting the Aave Protocol's security needs, is expected to free up budget contributing to sustaining sGHO. Allocating budget from stkGHO to sGHO is exected to reduce per unit of GHO staked spend and lead to an increase in the circulating supply of GHO. This transition is expected to materially impact GHO's revenue upside.\n\nDetails relating to the optimal yield and amount of stkGHO are presented in the Umbrella forum post.\n\n## stataGSM\n\nThe rollout of stataGSMs across Ethereum, Arbitrum and Base is expected to improve the DAO's revenue streams with currently idle capital being deployed to earn yield for the Aave DAO. On Arbitrum and Base, the GSMs will provide users with the ability to `Transafer` GHO into circulating Suppy.\n\n# Specification\n\nThis proposal is to be further refined at the ARFC stage, the following summarises the key characteristics of sGHO:\n\n* No Re-Hypothecation minimising smart contract risk;\n* Facilitators are to be used to Mint and Deploy GHO for yield;\n* No Deposit & Withdrawal Fees promoting frictionless user experience;\n* Introduce a Supply Cap to limit DAO's financial exposure; and,\n* Aave Savings Rate set by GHO Stewards determines sGHO yield;\n\nExecution and implementation is to be a collaboration between by Aave DAO service providers.\n\nThe Aave Savings Rate, budget and sGHO paramaters are to be finalised during the ARFC stage of the governance process.\n\n# Disclosure\n\nThe TokenLogic team extends its sincere gratitude to all Aave service providers, delegates, and community members who contributed to this proposal’s peer review. Your expertise and insights have been invaluable in refining and strengthening this TEMP CHECK.\n\n# Next Steps\n\n1. Gather feedback from the community.\n2. If consensus is reached on this [TEMP CHECK], escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n3. If Snapshot outcome is YAE, escalate this proposal to the [ARFC] stage.\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

        "body": "---\n\nTitle: [TEMP CHECK] Activate and Deploy GHO Safety Module on Arbitrum\nAuthor: ACI (Aave Chan Initiative)\nDate: 2024-05-27\n\n---\n\n### **Summary**\nThis proposal aims to establish a dedicated Safety Module for GHO, Aave's native stablecoin, on Arbitrum, to enhance the security and stability of the Aave Protocol.\n\nThe GHO Safety Module (GSM) will be similar to the existing Aave Safety Module (SM), providing an additional layer of protection against shortfall events and incentivizing stakeholders through rewards by using and staking GHO on Arbitrum.\n\nDeploying the GHO Safety Module on Arbitrum aligns with Aave's strategic goals of fostering a secure and scalable environment for its stablecoin. This proposal leverages Arbitrum's technological advantages and financial incentives, setting a solid foundation for GHO's growth and stability.\n\n### **Motivation**\n\nThe [GHO Safety Module](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-upgrade-safety-module-with-stkgho/15635) was created with the aim of mitigating risks using GHO’s stablecoin attributes for potential shortfall events, thereby fortifying the Aave Protocol’s resilience by adding a stablecoin asset, which is inherently less volatile than AAVE. This strategic move diversified the Safety Module’s capacity to absorb shocks from various risk vectors in case of shortfall events.\n\nCreating a GHO SM on Arbitrum responds to several factors:\n\n1. Scalability and low fees\n2. Strong Ecosystem and Liquidity injection\n\nCreating a GHO Safety Module on Arbitrum will ensure support and liquidity for GHO on Arbitrum.\n\nTo provide more context, Aave DAO recently received a Long Term Incentive Pilot Program Grant of 750K ARB from Arbitrum DAO, in order to expand GHO into the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\nThe funds would be used as follows:\n\n- 375K ARB distributed over a 12-week period amounts to around 1% additional yield to users. While this could be higher, it will be meaningful enough to make ETH and GHO borrows sufficiently attractive to boost TVL and borrow metrics.\n- 375K ARB used for GHO liquidity mining rewards. To target a sufficient size of GHO liquidity on the network, reward rates will need to be similar to mainnet. The GHO Liquidity Committee has used a mix of incentives to keep GHO at peg. We expect that a similar yield will be needed to manage the GHO peg on Arbitrum.\n\nTogether, these two uses of the grant funds should increase TVL and borrowing demand on Arbitrum. Arbitrum will be one of the most attractive networks to borrow on Aave due to the borrowing incentives. It will be the most appealing L2 to borrow and use GHO when it goes cross-chain.\n\nAnother example is the recent approval by Aave DAO of the [GHO Cross-Chain Launch strategy for the GHO](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0x2a6ffbcff41a5ef98b7542f99b207af9c1e79e61f859d0a62f3bf52d3280877a) stablecoin, the native asset of the Aave Protocol, beginning with the initial expansion to the Arbitrum network. This expansion will utilize the Chainlink Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP).\n\n### **Specification**\n\n1. **Deployment of GHO Safety Module on Arbitrum**:\n    - Establish the GHO SM smart contracts on Arbitrum to manage and protect GHO assets.\n    - Integrate Chainlink oracles for accurate and reliable price feeds.\n2. **Incentive Program**:\n    - Utilize ARB incentives to bootstrap GHO liquidity and adoption on Arbitrum.\n    - Implement liquidity mining programs and other yield strategies to attract and retain GHO holders.\n3. **Merit Incentive Program**:\n    - Stakeholders who participate in staking GHO on Arbitrum will be eligible for Merit rewards. The Merit program is designed to incentivize both borrowing and staking GHO. The rewards will enhance user participation and the overall security of the GHO ecosystem on Arbitrum.\n\n### Useful Links:\n\n[**[ARFC] Upgrade Safety Module with StkGHO**](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-upgrade-safety-module-with-stkgho/15635)\n\n**[Aave LTIPP Council Recommended Proposal](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x1a4d8072fce74d8fc069cf0ca33fb6348e3aa66ab6369dd3dbcaaff01f2cebbd)**\n\n**[[Aave] LTIPP Application](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aave-ltipp-application-final/21741)**\n\n### Disclaimer\n\nACI is not presenting this TEMP CHECK on behalf of any third party and is not being compensated for creating this TEMP CHECK.\n\n### Next Steps\n\n1.

        "body": "## Author: ACI (Aave Chan Initiative)\n\n## Date: 2024-11-25\n\n---\n\n## Summary\n\nThis ARFC seeks governance feedback and approval to deprecate the Etherfi mainnet instance and reformat the Instances model in the Ethereum Mainnet Aave ecosystem. Previous [TEMP CHECK](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-aave-instances-strategy-shift/19676) passed the [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0x4df33a97b891e6237a69643dc12d676fedd778470f27630d33cdc4c9cb3edf4d)\n\n## Motivation\n\nAave 3.2 introduced liquid E-modes, creating a new universe of options and efficiency improvements for the Aave ecosystem.\n\nThe Aave Instances vision, created & pushed by the ACI, is a massive success with the Lido instance that recently surpassed a billion-dollar market size.\n\nThat being said, the rationale of this instance was to isolate use cases to avoid friction and undesirable asset interactions within the same instance. This came at the cost of liquidity fragmentation, but when we initiated this vision, it was the most straightforward implementation option.\n\nAave 3.2 was a paradigm shift because Liquid E-modes allow us to isolate use cases without having to fragment liquidity. A suitable example of this is in the Lido instance. Without liquid E-mode, ezETH & wstETH would be competing for wETH liquidity, creating friction & sub-optimal interactions.\n\nWith the current setup, ezETH contributes to wstETH supply yield and therefore indirectly contributes to wETH supply yield. This created synergies instead of tensions by isolating inside liquid E-modes which assets are collateral for specific borrowing assets.\n\nWith Aave 3.2, it doesn’t make sense anymore to have many different instances as all these assets can coexist in a synergistic way inside the same instance and contribute to the same liquidity, with value added to each other.\n\nFor these reasons, we suggest a merge of Etherfi & Lido instances and further refinement of the 3.2 E-Mode strategies. EtherFi’s instance was meant to focus on LRT deposits with stablecoin borrowing interactions. But with 3.2, just like we implemented with ezETH, we can allow weETH to borrow wstETH and stablecoins via two segregated liquid E-modes inside the “Lido” instance, having the best of both worlds in the same pool.\n\nAnother important thing to consider is that Aave protocol revenue is heavily concentrated in a few assets. The money makers in Aave are: wBTC (and growing BTC-correlated assets), the ETH-correlated assets (wstETH, weETH & wETH), USDC, USDT & GHO. Everything else has minor contributions to the Aave DAO revenue.\n\nEvery asset that is used as collateral in Aave increases the potential for a shortfall event. It’s crucial we think as a DAO about the risk/reward of each collateral onboarding with consideration for potential revenue generation.\n\nUntil the launch of Aave V4, we do not have an option to impose a risk premium to borrow some assets using some collateral, so we are currently in a situation where we can create no premium and no added revenue to use lower demand assets when compared with blue-chip collateral.\n\nAs Aave DAO revenue is a volume-at-scale profit model, we end up with little to no revenue with some assets as collateral.\n\nThe Aave DAO earns the reserve factor on interest paid by borrowers, from the current market borrow rates. Using USDC as an example, the DAO earned an average of 35-50 bps per year on volume generated.\n\nFor some small collaterals in the main instance, actual revenue doesn’t cross 5 figures, which is a bad deal when considering the risk associated with any collateral onboarding, regardless of isolation mode, caps, and exposure. At the Aave scale, no amount of risk is worth less than 5 figures of revenue.\n\nThis is intrinsic with the Aave model of earning only at scale as interest paid by borrowers is largely sent back to LPs. The exception to this is the GHO stablecoin where the protocol itself is the LP and earns all interest paid by borrowers.\n\nStill, having the same cost to borrow GHO using wETH as collateral compared to an emergent asset doesn’t make economic sense from the perspective of the DAO.\n\nDespite these economic realities, it is important to be able to onboard new assets inside the Aave protocol to avoid them gaining traction in Aave alternatives. We also witness some frustration from ecosystem actors that consider Aave “too elitist”.\n\nA solution to this is to create a new instance that we propose to name the “Emergence” instance. This instance will only onboard assets in isolation mode with the sole ability to borrow GHO. GHO will be onboarded as a 0% LTV asset with an interest curve higher than GHO on the main Aave instance.\n\nThis will have several benefits:\n\n- Create a de-facto risk premium on GHO with some collaterals, adjusting reward in terms of DAO revenue with risk taken by protocol\n- Create a path to onboard emerging assets in the Aave ecosystem, allow to impose goals and KPIs on these collaterals (i.e., it must generate $X of volume over Y days) before consideration for onboarding on the main instance\n- Allow for quick and relatively painless offboarding if a collateral performs below DAO expectations. If KPIs are not met, we can set LTV to zero, reduce caps, decrease LT, and offboard in a short time period\n- If an asset does hit KPIs, it would have a strong case to be supported & onboarded in the Main instance\n\nIn terms of risk management, it’s likely current GHO stakers might not be keen on being the counterparties of an emergence market. This TEMP CHECK seeks community feedback on the creation of a “Junior Tranche” stkGHO for stakers willing to earn more risk in exchange for more rewards.\n\nAs the Borrow rate of GHO is set higher than on the main instance, the junior tranche StkGHO (or jtStkGHO) can be financed by the borrow rate premium from the Emergence instance.\n\nUsing the upcoming Umbrella program, Risk and Aave service providers can define a target liquidity to protect GHO in case one of the collaterals on the Emergence instance experiences a failure and shortfall event.\n\nLastly, to reflect on risk, we propose to not provide any stkAAVE discount for this instance.\n\nTo clarify this new set of instances, we propose the following naming conventions:\n\n- The Lido instance will become the “Prime” instance, focused on blue-chip collaterals and high leverage correlated assets use cases\n- The main instance will become the “Core” instance, it’s meant to stay the most liquid and best risk-adjusted yield instance for LPs and borrows with more diversity of options\n- The new instance will be the “Emergence” instance, meant to expand in a controlled and suitable risk/reward way the family of assets supported by the Aave protocol. Successful assets in Emergence are meant to eventually be onboarded in “Core”\n- The Junior tranche stkGHO is named “jtStkGHO”\n\n## Specification\n\nThis AIP seeks to get feedback on:\n\n- Freezing and offboarding of the “Etherfi” Instance\n- Rebranding and merge of current “Etherfi” instance to the current “Lido” instance, to be rebranded as “Prime” instance\n- Rebranding of “Main” instance into “Core” instance\n- Freeze and offboard smaller collaterals from the “Core” instance\n- Deployment of “Emergence” instance, with GHO onboarding or new facilitator creation and some of the offboarded assets of Core instance (to be defined during ARFC phase)\n- Definition of a KPI framework for assets in Emergence instance\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nACI did not receive compensation for creation of this proposal.\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. Publication of a standard ARFC, collect community & service providers feedback before escalating proposal to ARFC snapshot stage.\n2. If the ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, publish the necessary AIPs for final confirmation and enforcement of the proposal.\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived under [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)",

        "body": "---\n\ntitle: [ARFC] Aave Liquidity Committee Funding Phase VI\nauthor: @TokenLogic\ncreated: 2025-04-03\n\n---\n\n# Summary\n\nThis publication presents the Aave Liquidity Committee (ALC) Phase VI Funding request. \n\n# Phase V Update\n\n## GHO Supply\n\nOver the course of the last quarter, the market dynamics surrounding GHO experienced a notable shift. As yield opportunities in the broader DeFi landscape became less attractive due to declining funding rates, users began redirecting their capital in search of alternative sources of return.\n\nGHO, particularly through its liquidity provision use cases, emerged as a compelling destination. This resurgence in interest was further reinforced by the reactivation and full replenishment of the GSMs, which had previously been nearly emptied. These modules went from holding negligible balances to over $28M in total during the period. \n\n![Screenshot 2025-04-03 at 20.01.51](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BkpQj8ha1e.png)\n\n## Ethereum\n\n### DEX Liquidity\n\nOn Ethereum, GHO's peg has been resilient and consistent during Q1 of 2025 and the deeper DEX liquidity has enabled larger swap sizes to be processed with minimal price impact.\n\nWith perp funding rates and broader DeFi liquidity costs trending lower, Liquidity Provider (LPs) deposits across GHO DEX pools experienced significant growth, surpassing $85M. \n\n![Screenshot 2025-04-03 at 19.28.53](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HJs_7Un6kl.png)\n\nIn addition, USDT volatility helped grow GSM TVL to over $28M, ensuring continuous, on-demand support for GHO's peg.\n\n![Screenshot 2025-04-03 at 19.37.44](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rJUtSIh6yg.png)\n\n### Balancer v3\n\nGHO became the centrepiece asset within the new generation of Balancer pools, reflecting its growing systemic importance. On Ethereum, the primary GHO 3pool successfully migrated to the v3 boosted model, is approaching $30M in TVL.\n\nThe new Aave Boosted 3pool has exceeded the previous v2 pool’s performance, whilst also delivering superior capital efficiency and deeper liquidity provisioning. On Arbitrum liquidity was migrated from v2 to v3 liquidity and new v3 pools created on Base. \n\nOn Arbitrum and Base, these pools incorporated the new “surge” pricing mechanism, which dynamically increases swap fees as the pool diverges from the peg. This mechanism adds an additional layer of price defense, reinforcing the GHO's peg on L2s.\n\n![Screenshot 2025-04-03 at 19.43.34](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HJQywLh6Jl.png)\n\n### Prime Instance\n\nAnother major milestone during Phase V was the introduction of the GHO and the Gho Mint facilitator on the Prime instance. This new market brought new multifaceted utility to GHO.\n\n- Created a structure in which GHO could be pre-minted and held by the DAO, providing operational flexibility and improving responsiveness to market demand.\n- Enables GHO to earn yield directly through variable-rate borrow mechanisms, enabling more capital-efficient stablecoin management.\n- Unlocked additional yield opportunities for Balancer v3 pools to deposit into, incentivizing further liquidity provisioning.\n\nLastly, the Prime instance permitted a portion of the GHO allowances allocated to service providers and ecosystem initiatives to be deposited into yield-bearing positions, improving overal capital efficiency of the assets held in the DAO's treasury.\n\n![Screenshot 2025-04-03 at 19.46.58](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/S1G3vI261g.png)\n\n### Fluid and Rings Integration\n\nFluid has been whitelisted to be the home of GHO from the backing of scUSD. It has grown to over 6M without incentive on Fluid directly with a very low acquisition cost due to a deposit campaign featuring Bungee to encourage GHO deposits in Rings.\n\nOver the coming weeks, Rings is expected to onboard Gearbox by Veda. As GHO deposits continue to grow, GHO liquidity is expected to be distributed across Fluid and Gearbox. \n\nReference: https://x.com/Token_Logic/status/1905352281027166589\n\n### PYUSD/GHO Liquidity\n\n7.5M liquidity was sourced for the PYUSD/GHO Balancer v3 liquidity pool.\n\n### Resolv Collaboration\n\nOne of the most innovative integrations of the quarter was GHO’s entry into the Resolv ecosystem. In collaboration with Resolv, the ALC deployed a campaign centred on the Curve GHO/USR LP token, and worked with both Pendle and Spectra to create yield markets enabling the ALC to receive a higher ROI on bribe spend, ~x2.2-2.4 multiplier compared to x1.1-1.3 directly on DEXs. \n\nThis was a great success knowing that no other asset of its kind had previously gained such traction in structured yield products. The campaign was enhanced by a one-month point-boost from Resolv, supplemented by strategic incentives from the ALC. The result was unprecedented: the initiative led to the formation of the largest GHO and USR liquidity pools, reaching up to $35 million in TVL.\n\n![Screenshot 2025-04-03 at 19.48.37](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Sk_zuLhTJg.png)\n\n### Arbitrum\n\nDespite the broader success seen on Ethereum and Base, GHO’s growth on Arbitrum remains modest. The lack of meaningful traction can be attributed to delays in strategic integrations, most notably the anticipated collaboration with Synthetix, which ultimately opted to shift its primary focus and development efforts to the Base network. As a result, the GHO ecosystem on Arbitrum has yet to reach critical mass, although foundational infrastructure remains in place for future expansion.\n\n### Base\n\nPhase V also saw the deployment of GHO on Base, a move that has already begun to bear fruit. GHO’s main liquidity pool on Base, the Balancer v3 GHO/USDC pool, has surpassed $13.5 million in TVL within a relatively short period. This rapid growth reflects strong initial interest and suggests high potential for deeper integrations. One such opportunity lies in the upcoming collaboration with Synthetix, which is now in advanced planning stages with Odos soon to integrate the stataToken factory enabling the waBasGHO integration to advance with Synthetix. \n\n# Phase VI Lookahead\n\n## Ethereum\n\nGHO has already secured a strong presence on Ethereum, with integrations across a wide range of protocols. It is now actively used within lending protocols such as Gearbox and Fluid, offering users capital-efficient strategies centred on GHO. In the DEX landscape, GHO is supported across Balancer, Curve, Maverick, and Fluid, demonstrating its growing utility and liquidity footprint across various AMMs. \n\nGHO will remain at the front stage of Ethereum's DeFi, ALC members are actively looking for collaboration with promising projects at early stage to give access to interesting opportunities for GHO holders. The latest best example was the Resolv collaboration. This will continue during Phase VI as well.\n\n### L2s and Multichain Strategies\n\nA core priority for Phase VI will be the continued development of GHO’s multichain strategy, centered around the use of one facilitator on Ethereum, the use of the CCIP bridge, and the implementation of GSMs on destination chains. These Stability Modules will be pre-filled by the Ethereum facilitator, enabling native swaps into GHO on arrival chains and eliminating the need for inefficient bridging. \n\nThis architecture significantly enhances capital efficiency by allowing users to mint or swap GHO directly on their preferred chain. It also addresses one of the key friction points observed in Phase V, as bridging has proven to be a major brake on growth. By enabling native, trust-minimized GHO access across chains, the stataGSMs will remove barriers to adoption and improve user experience across ecosystems.\n\nThe modified stataGSM is currently in the last stages of review with @TokenLogic and @AaveLabs. \n\n### Sonic, Avalanche and Gnosis\n\nThree key chains are being targeted for GHO deployment in the near future: Sonic, Avalanche, and Gnosis. Each of these networks offers a unique opportunity to tailor GHO’s integration to the strengths of the local ecosystem.\n\nOn Sonic with @TokenLogic leading the deployment, the ALC plans to position GHO at the heart of one of the most innovative DeFi environments currently emerging. The goal is to create strong synergies with leading protocols such as Pendle, Rings, Beets, and Silo. Sonic offers a highly composable, fast-moving landscape where GHO can fit perfectly.\n\nOn Avalanche, with @AaveLabs leading the deployment, GHO will benefit from the support of the Avalanche Foundation, which is preparing to launch new incentive programs at the chain level. The ALC is working to ensure that GHO is a key participant in these initiatives. The playbook established with Balancer v3 on Ethereum may be replicated here, with additional attention to exploring synergies with Avalanche’s native stablecoin AUSD. This deployment will be focused on ecosystem-wide coordination.\n\nOn Gnosis, with @AaveLabs leading the deployment, the vision is centred on integrating GHO into the Gnosis Card ecosystem. The objective is to streamline both on- and off-ramping processes. The ALC will work closely with KPK and the Gnosis Foundation to facilitate this integration, creating a seamless user experience for payments, transfers, and financial access via GHO on Gnosis.\n\n## Performance Metrics\n\nThe below details some high-level GHO metrics:\n\n| Description | Ethereum | Arbitrum |Avalanche | Base |\n| --------  | :--------:  | :--------:  | :--------:  | :--------:  |\n| TVL DEX Liquidity Pools | 85M | 10M | 10M | 20M |\n| TVL Utility Liquidity Pools (Excl. stkGHO)  | 15M  | 5M | 5M | 5M|\n| DEX Liquidity Composition | < 50% GHO (< 33% for 3pools)  | < 50% GHO (< 33% for 3pools)  | < 50% GHO  (< 33% for 3pools) | < 50% GHO  (< 33% for 3pools) | \n| Swap Price Impact $5M Swap (GHO to USDC) | < 0.10%  | < 0.25%  | < 0.25%  | < 0.25%  |\n| Annualised Peg Volatility | < 5.00%  | < 5.00%  |< 5.00%  |< 5.00%  |\n| Price level for >90% time | $0.995  | $0.995 | $0.995 | $0.995 |\n\nPlease note, each of the above targets has external dependencies beyond the control of the ALC.

        "body": "---\n\ntitle: [ARFC] Aave Liquidity Committee Funding Phase III  \nauthor: @karpatkey_TokenLogic  \ncreated: 2024-06-11\n\n---\n\n# Summary\n\nThis publication proposes funding the Aave Liquidity Committee (ALC) with 600k GHO to continue supporting GHO's liquidity and DeFi integrations over the next three months on Ethereum.\n\nThe ALC will be funded by 375,000 ARB on Arbitrum from the LTIPP submission by the @ACI.\n\n# Motivation\n\nAs GHO continues to grow on Ethereum, there is an increasing need for deeper liquidity to facilitate greater swap sizes with minimal price impact. Providing a great UX for larger swaps is a prerequisite for enabling more sophisticated and larger DeFi users to transition into GHO.\n\nAs GHO expands to other networks, like Arbitrum with others to follow, the ALC aims to develop a liquidity strategy and drive efforts that create utility to support the adoption of GHO on each new deployment.\n\n## Ethereum\n\n### Phase II Update\n\nOver the last three months, the Aave Liquidity Committee has actively supported GHO liquidity across various DEXes and coordinated several key initiatives, leading to improved swap conditions.\n\nSome of the notable achievements are mentioned below:\n\n* GHO trading at peg\n* Deeper on-chain DEX liquidity (Increase from 13M to over 32M)\n* Borrow Cap increased from 32M to 85M \n* Improved peg resilience\n* Both USDC and USDT GSMs are funded\n* Cowswap & Paraswap have integrated various GHO liquidity pool types\n* Cowswap has integrated both USDC and USDT GSMs\n\nIn combination with other efforts like stkGHO, ALC-led initiatives have played a critical role in supporting GHO's peg recovery. The peg has recovered, the two GSMs are funded, and there is now over 32M in DEX liquidity pools. The vast majority of the DEX liquidity is nominated in the non-GHO trading pair.\n\nMaverick has been a critical tool for helping recover the peg. As GHO appreciated, several Boosted Positions were deployed providing additional liquidity depth to prevent GHO from retracing. With the imminent launch of Maverick v2, new pools will be deployed and liquidity will be reconstructed to reflect recent trading history.\n\n### Phase III Lookahead\n\nAs GHO continues to grow, there is a genuine requirement for deeper liquidity to accommodate larger swaps on a more consistent basis. During Phase III, the ALC will focus on the following key areas:\n\n* Reduced price volatility\n* Deeper structured concentrated liquidity\n* Grow non stable-coin-paired liquidity pools\n\nWith several ongoing efforts to onboard larger GHO users, this creates a need to consistently accommodate increasingly larger swaps with minimal price impact. In the months ahead we expect several builders to transition to GHO.\n\nAchieving 50M of DEX liquidity across various integrations remains a key focus. Initiatives like adding the GHO/USDC ECLP to the Safety Module (SM) will help achieve this goal. Other efforts include increasing the amplification on the Balancer 3pool, which are also helping facilitate larger swaps. The anticipated Maverick airdrop is also expected to contribute towards growing liquidity by complementing GHO emissions.\n\nSupporting the growth of GHO utility in collaboration with Aave Grants DAO has resulted in several integrations. The ALC will continue to promote integrations and create utility supporting broader adoption.\n\nIn the near term, we expect broader market conditions to improve. This is likely to result in increased liquidity costs for sustaining existing LP deposits and also elevated costs for attracting new liquidity deposits. The ALC is receiving feedback from various fund managers of increasing hurdle rate expectations for new capital deployments. This can largely be attributed to opportunity costs and risk-adjusted returns from competing yield sources.\n\nThe proposed Ethereum budget for Phase III:\n\n| Objective | Previous Budget | Proposed Budget   |\n| --------  | :--------:  | :--------: |\n| Liquidity  + Utility | 500,000 GHO | 600,000 GHO |\n\n## Arbitrum\n\nWith the launch of GHO on Arbitrum being imminent, the ALC aims to design a liquidity strategy and support creating utility for GHO within the ecosystem. The initial strategy is likely to feature ECLPs on Balancer via Gyroscope, concentrated liquidity on Maverick v2 when deployed, and possibly other DEXes.\n\nA general update on GHO's liquidity launch is mentioned below:\n\n* GHO/(a)USDC ECLP - Included in the Arbitrum SM\n* GHO/USDe ECLP - Partnership with Ethena, Gyroscope, and Balancer\n* (d)GHO/GYD ECLP - Partnership with Gyroscope and possibly Gearbox\n* GHO/USDC/USDT - Balancer v2\n* GHO/USDC - Maverick v2 upon launch\n\nOther pools are being evaluated as we progressively work towards finalising the GHO launch liquidity plans.\n\nThe proposed Arbitrum budget for Phase III, which excludes SM Emission, is shown below:\n\n| Objective | Proposed Budget |\n| --------  | :--------:  |\n| Liquidity  + Utility (excl. SM) | 375,000 ARB |\n\n## Performance Metrics\n\nThe below details some high-level GHO metrics we propose tracking:\n\n| Description | Ethereum Value | Arbitrum Value |\n| --------  | :--------:  | :--------:  |\n| TVL DEX Liquidity Pools | 50M | 30M |\n| TVL Utility Liquidity Pools (Excl. stkGHO)  | 15M  | 10M |\n| DEX Liquidity Composition | < 50% GHO (< 33% for 3pools)  | < 50% GHO (< 33% for 3pools)  |\n| Swap Price Impact $5M Swap (GHO to USDC) | < 0.10%  | < 0.25%  |\n| Annualised Peg Volatility | < 5.00%  | < 5.00%  |\n| Price level for >90% time | $0.995 using [Redstone Medium Price](https://app.redstone.finance/#/app/token/GHO)  | $0.995 using [Redstone Medium Price](https://app.redstone.finance/#/app/token/GHO) |\n\nPlease note, each of the above targets has external dependencies beyond the control of the ALC. The above table serves as a North Star for the ALC to strive towards over the next three months. Having measurable targets provides a clear direction and goal to achieve.\n\n# Specification\n\nOf the 2M GHO held by the ALC from AIP-115, 600,000 GHO shall be retained by the ALC and the remaining 1.4M transferred to the collector contract.\n\nALC Ethereum SAFE: `0x205e795336610f5131Be52F09218AF19f0f3eC60`  \nALC Arbitrum SAFE: `TBA`\n\n# Disclosure\n\nTokenLogic and karpatkey receive no payment for this proposal.
