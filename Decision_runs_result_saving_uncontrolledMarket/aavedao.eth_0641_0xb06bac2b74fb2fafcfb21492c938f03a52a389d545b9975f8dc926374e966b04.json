        "body": "# Summary\n\nThis is a proposal for adding borrow/lend support for StakeWise’s sETH2 on AAVE.\n\n# Motivation\n\nStaking is foundational to the Ethereum network, with liquid staking specifically providing users with the opportunity to unlock the power of their staked capital. One of the most requested features within our protocol is the ability to utilise sETH2 as collateral to borrow against.\n\nsETH2 is ideal collateral for borrowing ETH specifically, given the high correlation between asset prices. Following the launch of eMode within Aave V3, sETH2 would allow for leveraged ETH staking without taking on a lot of risk. Lido’s stETH has proven to be a valuable collateral asset within the Aave ecosystem and it’s time to explore adding sETH2, the second most liquid ETH staking token. This integration would benefit both StakeWise and Aave, bringing new users to both platforms.\n\n### Relevant Links\n\n[Website](https://stakewise.io/)\n[Dune Dashboard](https://dune.xyz/jgf1/Stakewise)\n[Audits - Runtime Verification, Certik and Omniscia](https://github.com/stakewise/contracts/tree/master/audits)\n[Documentation](https://docs.stakewise.io/)\n[Medium](https://stakewise.medium.com/)\n[Github Page\n](https://github.com/stakewise/contracts)[sETH2 contract](https://etherscan.io/token/0xfe2e637202056d30016725477c5da089ab0a043a)\n[StakeWise dual tokenomics](https://stakewise.medium.com/the-tokenomics-of-staking-pools-what-are-staked-eth-tokens-and-how-do-they-work-2b4084515711)\n[StakeWise Metro Upgrade](https://stakewise.medium.com/a-new-era-for-stakewise-decentralizing-the-architecture-e598fde75ea8)\n\nCommunities: [Discord](https://discord.gg/vM3a3csBDS) / [Twitter](https://twitter.com/stakewise_io) / [Forum](https://forum.stakewise.io/)\n\n# Specifications\n\n**What is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset?**\n\nI (Jordan Sutcliffe) am the BizDev Lead at StakeWise, submitting the proposal on behalf of StakeWise DAO.\n\n**Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token**\n\n->*StakeWise Overview*\n\nStakeWise is a liquid ETH2 staking platform that removes key barriers to entry, such as requiring 32 ETH and the expertise needed for maintaining staking infrastructure, allowing anyone to benefit from the rewards of the Beacon Chain.\n\nETH deposits into the staking pool are tokenised into sETH2, representing users’ interest-bearing (staked) capital. Staking rewards passively accrue in a separate token, rETH2 (note this application will focus solely on sETH2).\n\nAs a liquid staking platform, users are free to un-stake at any time by trading their sETH2 back into ETH utilising the protocol’s deep liquidity pools.\n\nDmitri Tsumak first announced StakeWise was under development in April 2020. StakeWise launched on mainnet in March 2021, following a 9-month beta phase. StakeWise was the first staking pool to move to non-custodial staking in April 2021 and has since grown to over 70k ETH staked, helping DAOs, whales and individuals alike. In January 2022, the StakeWise Metro upgrade was announced, commencing the decentralisation of the protocol. Further information on Metro can be found [here](https://stakewise.medium.com/a-new-era-for-stakewise-decentralizing-the-architecture-e598fde75ea8).\n\nStakeWise has been audited by [Runtime Verification, Certik and Omniscia](https://github.com/stakewise/contracts/tree/master/audits).\n\n->*sETH2 Overview*\n\nsETH2 tokens (ERC-20) represent a tokenised staking deposit into StakeWise’s staking pool. sETH2 is consequently backed 1-to-1 with ETH held within validators. sETH2 acts as an interest-bearing form of wrapped ETH (not re-pricing or rebalancing), providing holders with the right to a share of the staking pool rewards. These rewards are distributed in the form of rETH2.\n\nsETH2 supply sits at [59,266](https://etherscan.io/token/0xfe2e637202056d30016725477c5da089ab0a043a) (~$200M), held by ~3k individual users. The main liquidity pool for sETH2 is on UniSwap ([here](https://info.uniswap.org/#/pools/0x7379e81228514a1d2a6cf7559203998e20598346)). This pool has ~$160M TVL, consisting of ~26k ETH and ~30k sETH2. StakeWise is in the process of launching a second liquidity pool on Curve, with further details provided below.\n\n**Explain the positioning of token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset?**\n\nsETH2 is ideal collateral for borrowing ETH, given the high correlation and the proven peg stability of sETH2 (detailed further below). This makes sETH2 a prime candidate for Aave’s new eMode to enable leveraged staking.\n\nsETH2 collateral would also allow holders to take speculative positions, such as shorting an asset or taking a leveraged long position on ETH, for example.\n\nsETH2 has deep liquidity with ~$160M TVL, soon to be spread across multiple pools.\n\n**Provide a brief history of the project and the different components: DAO (is it live?), products (are they live?). How did it overcome some of the challenges it faced?**\n\nStakeWise’s background is detailed above.\n\nStakeWise DAO is live and manages the protocol. Whether it is changing the protocol fees, adding node operators to the network or making amendments to smart contracts, all changes require DAO approval. The StakeWise DAO is [community-owned](https://docs.stakewise.io/governance/stakewise-dao#tokenomics) with all voting rights falling to holders of SWISE, the StakeWise governance token.\n\nInvestors in the StakeWise DAO consist of Blockdaemon, boldstart Ventures, Greenfield One, Collider Ventures, Lionschain Capital and gumi Cryptos.\n\nThe StakeWise product suite consists of liquid staking on both Ethereum and Gnosis chain, branching out into other PoS networks over time.\n\n**How is the asset currently used?**\n\nFirst and foremost, sETH2 provides holders, from individual retail stakers to DAOs, the rights to staking rewards from the Beacon Chain.\n\nCreating utility for sETH2 is of the highest priority. Currently, sETH2 can be used to provide liquidity on AMMs, such as UniSwap and Curve. Multiple other integrations are lined up involving sETH2, such as using sETH2 as collateral to borrow against.\n\n**Emission schedule**\n\nThere is no emission schedule. sETH2 is minted only when ETH is deposited into the StakeWise staking pool.\n\n**Token (& Protocol) permissions (minting) and upgradability. Is there a multisig? What can it do? Who are the signers?**\n\n-> *Multi-sigs*\n\nStakeWise has run non-custodial ETH staking since April 2021. Prior to April 2021, a multi-sig was used, named the Horcrux, with ~18k ETH of the StakeWise pool currently controlled by the Horcrux. More info can be found [here](https://docs.stakewise.io/stakewise-pool#the-horcrux).\n\nThe DAO treasury is a [Gnosis Safe](https://gnosis-safe.io/app/#/safes/0x144a98cb1CdBb23610501fE6108858D9B7D24934) with a DAO committee of 7 persons. The goal of the DAO committee is to monitor transactions voted upon via Snapshot and reject malicious transactions that would harm the protocol. In order to reject a transaction, a threshold of 4 out of 7 committee members must sign the rejection.\n\n1.

[Otto de Voogd](https://twitter.com/ottodv) - 0x1C86117156Ba31b5d62f02eB56bE9aC5a06610d3\n\n-> *Upgradable Contracts:* Yes (DAO approval only)\n\nA successful Snapshot vote is required to make any changes to StakeWise smart contracts. The DAO is [community owned](https://docs.stakewise.io/governance/stakewise-dao#tokenomics) and all voting rights fall to holders of SWISE, the StakeWise governance token.\n\n**Market data (Market Cap, 24h Volume, Volatility, Exchanges, Maturity)**\n\nMarket Cap ~$167M\n\nVolatility -\n\nsETH2 has proven peg stability. Superimposing stETH / ETH with sETH2 / ETH highlights this stability when compared against stETH which is already whitelisted for Aave.\n\n![|624x205](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/iV-tgDKkGvUmpr9MP6D9-qWNApCsLGrTiBqlIGL3K4IfXl2MB--glv35OerGGzZteAOZaAtbKVkCsGhGUuzgxD4JWBDpv76zk0QkfRaEMpIGAuuOuo1Ot6Ey8GF6qRC6c3JHTA60)\n\nNote that StakeWise will soon be adjusting the main UniSwap pool by reducing the fee tier from 0.3% to 0.01%, which is expected to close the remaining gap between sETH2 and ETH.

Currently, there are 5 oracles live with details provided [here](https://launchpad.eatsteakbewise.com/oraclestatus-mainnet.html). Note that the number of oracles on the network will be increasing from 5 to 10 over the coming months.\n\n4 out of the 5 oracles are required to submit the same rewards data for the total supply of rETH2 is updated. Further information is found [here](https://github.com/stakewise/oracle/blob/master/README.md).\n\nAs previously detailed, the protocol is ultimately governed by the StakeWise DAO. Extra security features are in place to stop malicious transactions from passing through the DAO. For example, each successful on-chain proposal must undergo two days of escalation game, before entering one day of the multi-sig backstop period.\n\n-> *Staking risks*\n\nsETH2 holders are exposed to risks associated with staking, such as slashing events and downtime penalties. The StakeWise DAO has taken steps to mitigate these risks:\n\n* Prospective node operators are vetted by the validator committee, required to enter a testnet and must pass situational stress testing. Only then will the StakeWise DAO vote for whether an operator can join the network. StakeWise only on-boards leading node operators to ensure the highest security and yield for its users.\n* StakeWise provides node operators with an institutional-grade deployment package with embedded security features, such as the ability to quickly transition between staking clients on demand.\n* There is no staking insurance currently in place, however we are working with a third-party to provide protocol-level insurance as a high priority (expected to be in place by early May).\n\nNote that hostage risks are common in liquid staking pools, however this does not apply to StakeWise. The StakeWise DAO controls the exit signatures for its operators, allowing the DAO to force exit validators from the network should the situation arise. This makes it impossible for operators to hold pool funds hostage and will ensure that all future staking rewards, such as MEV and tips, flow to the pool.\n\nStakeWise has experienced no slashing or downtime penalties to date.\n\n-> *Smart Contract Risks*\n\nStakers are exposed to smart contract risk. To mitigate this, the protocol has undergone audits by 3 separate auditors: Runtime Verification, Certik and Omniscia ([reports are here](https://github.com/stakewise/contracts/tree/master/audits)). Our code is open-source and available [here](https://github.com/stakewise/contracts).\n\nDespite having no security concerns to date, StakeWise is committed to reducing the risk for its users and is in the process of adding a $200,000 bug bounty program with ImmuneFI.\n\n-> *Price Oracles*\n\nsETH2 currently relies on a UniSwap TWAP oracle. With the addition of new liquidity pools, we will be upgrading our oracle to a Chainlink oracle over the coming months.\n\n# Proposed Risk Parameters\n\n* LTV: 70% (vs 82.5% for ETH)\n* Liquidation Threshold: 75% (vs 85% for ETH)\n* Liquidation Bonus: 7.5% (vs 5% for ETH)\n* Reserve Factor: 10% (vs 10% for ETH)\n\nThe proposed sETH2 risk parameters are presented vs those of ETH and are in line with the current risk parameters of stETH. ETH and sETH2 are highly correlated, and as such, have similar volatility profiles. The LTV and liquidity threshold below that of ETH account for the extra risks associated with liquidating sETH2.\n\n### Interest Rate Model:\n\nUOptimal: 50%\nBase: 0%\nSlope 1: 8%\nSlope 2: 200%\n\n",

        "body": "## Summary\nThis is a proposal for adding borrow/lend support for Rocket Pool's rETH on Aave.\n\n## Motivation\nAave is a premier lending platform and basis for broader DeFi integration. The rETH token will offer many benefits to Aave if onboarded, just as rETH holders would benefit from making their assets more productive. The rETH token is important as a hedge against the risks of other ETH staking services (particularly because of its decentralized and permissionless nature) and will be an important addition to the DeFi space in general.\n\nRight now, Rocket Pool is bridging its rETH token across chains to make liquid staking more accessible for the masses - it is currently available in Optimism, Arbitrum, and zkSync. As the second largest liquid staking token, Aave is missing a key asset in demand. \n\n## Relevant Links\n- Website: https://rocketpool.net/\n- Dune Dashboard: https://dune.xyz/KIV/Rocketpool \n- Audits:\n  - https://consensys.net/diligence/audits/2021/04/rocketpool/\n  - https://rocketpool.net/files/SigmaPrimeAudit.pdf\n  - https://github.com/trailofbits/publications/blob/master/reviews/RocketPool.pdf \n- Documentation: https://docs.rocketpool.net/guides/staking/overview.html \n- Medium: https://medium.com/rocket-pool/rocket-pool-staking-protocol-part-1-8be4859e5fbd \n- Github Page: https://github.com/rocket-pool \n\n- Communities:\n  - https://discord.gg/GWtjmc4c\n  - https://twitter.com/Rocket_Pool\n  - https://dao.rocketpool.net/ \n- MakerDAO Risk Evaluation: https://forum.makerdao.com/t/reth-collateral-onboarding-risk-evaluation/15286\n- Aave Governance Discussion: https://governance.aave.com/t/proposal-add-support-for-reth-token/3585\n\n## Specifications\n###### What is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset?\n\nI'm Marceau, an Aave lending participant and Rocket Pool community member. I care a lot about democratizing the liquid staking derivative marketplace and helping to bring options to the market for the health of the broader Ethereum network.\n\n### Protocol Description\nThe Rocket Pool (RP) protocol is a decentralized Ethereum 2.0 Proof of Stake infrastructure service. Without staking pools, only wealthy network participants who meet the 32ETH threshold are rewarded for validating transactions. Rocket Pool democratizes participation in network validation by providing a service that lowers the wealth threshold. Abstracting staked ETH as rETH, participants can retain commodity properties of their stake (transfer of ownership).\n\nUnlike beacon chain ETH, rETH can be freely transferred and traded as it implements the ERC-20 interface. Further, unlike competing stETH by Lido, rETH passively gains value against ETH. This ratio is updated regularly by the oDAO—an oracle DAO composed of major ecosystem players such as Etherscan, Bankless, Prysm, and more.\n\nLido produces the stETH and wstETH tokens. The wstETH token acts just like rETH – allowing users to passively gain ETH staking rewards. The stETH-ETH Curve pool is one of the largest by TVL. However, the Lido network does not allow for permissionless node operators. All validators are hosted by a select set of nodes. As such, rETH provides decentralization support in a unique way.\n\nThere are 2 primary users in RocketPool:\n\n###### rETH Stakers\n\nStakers can deposit as little as 0.01 ETH in exchange for rETH. rETH is a redemption token representing staked ETH. This token can be burnt at the Rocket Pool contract or website in exchange for ETH and accumulated staking reward. They do not need to run a machine. The returns are subject to a commission to node operators, which is a % of the staking rewards earned.\n\n###### Node Operators\n\nNode Operators deposit 16 ETH, along with a minimum 1.6 ETH worth of RPL tokens as collateral to stake on behalf of the pool. This is permissionless, so anyone can run a node as long as they have the infrastructure and collateral. They will receive RPL inflation rewards, as well as ETH commission from the pool, along with staking rewards on their own 16 ETH.\n\nThe rETH and stETH token’s price histories can be found roughly on coingecko, however, the most liquid price for rETH is found here 4 with the oracle price dictating the rETH deposit pool. \n\n## Governance\nRocket Pool is governed by a dual DAO model. Responsibilities are split between the pDAO and the oDAO. The oDAO’s primary responsibilities come from the fact that the consensus layer needs to interact with the execution layer. Some tasks include setting the protocol accepted RPL/ETH ratio as well as updating the exchange rate for rETH/ETH based on protocol results.\n\nUntil recently, the oDAO was in ‘bootstrap’ mode allowing the Rocket Pool team to modify contracts and tweak parameters. This was removed and now the oDAO is self-governing between 14 members (https://rocketscan.io/dao). The pDAO is yet to be released. Currently, the Rocket Pool team manages inflation destined for the pDAO. At some point in the future, these assets and control of adjustable parameters in the protocol will be turned over to this DAO. It is unclear if all RPL holders will be able to vote or if a sybil mechanism will be installed such as limiting votes to only staked RPL holders. These functions are controlled by bootstrap mode.\n\nThe rETH token is available on numerous DEX contributing to a very stable peg. These diverse pools allow for a strong arbitrage market to keep the peg steady including the native deposit pool where rETH can be burned for the protocol oracle valuation against ETH. \n\nThe Curve wstETH-rETH pool is the most liquid exchange of rETH and single largest holder of the asset. This pool has benefitted from high capital efficiency and charitable incentives. \n\nThese are recently updated DeFi TVL metrics:\n\n- Alchemix (beta) WETH + rETH: $796,950 TVL\n- Curve rETH + wstETH: $43.4 million TVL 6\n- Balancer WETH + rETH: $15.3 million TVL\n- Uniswap: $102,000 TVL\n- Bancor: $334,000 TVL\n- Yearn Curve rETH Vault: $1.3 million TVL 1\n- Arbitrum - L1 ERC20 Gateway: $3.29 million TVL 1\n- Optimism - Gateway: $2.29 million TVL\n- Polygon (Matic) - ERC20 Bridge: $145,000 TVL 1\n- zkSync: $359,000 TVL 1\n\n## Security Considerations\nRocketpool recently passed 6 months live on mainnet which is still fairly new for a protocol. Despite this, the protocol has not seen any down time nor experienced any major losses nor hacks. Rocket Pool also has an active bug bounty programme with Immuni.Fi and is looking to progressively increase the bounty with time.\n\nThe protocol is susceptible to ETH execution risk on all major upgrades that involve the beacon chain. This includes potential complexity creep as SSV and MEV become core topics. There is governance risk between the oDAO and pDAO with the pDAO being more centrally controlled by the team bootstrap mode. The oDAO operates with majority consensus and so malicious attacks would require compromising many core Ethereum teams. Staking risk is low for rETH as slashing is insured against by Node Operator collateral and RPL stake. \n\n## Proposed Risk Parameters\n- LTV: 70% (vs 82.5% for ETH)\n- Liquidation Threshold: 75% (vs 85% for ETH)\n- Liquidation Bonus: 7.5% (vs 5% for ETH)\n- Reserve Factor: 10% (vs 10% for ETH)\n\nThe proposed rETH risk parameters are presented vs those of ETH and are in line with the current risk parameters of stETH and are identical to the proposal by sETH2. ETH and rETH are highly correlated, and as such, have similar volatility profiles. The LTV and liquidity threshold below that of ETH account for the extra risks associated with liquidating rETH.",

This stablecoin has become one of the biggest in the market with a supply of 48.7m, a TVL in the protocol of $87m, and an average daily volume > $4m. \n\nagEUR can at the moment only be issued on Ethereum mainnet, but it can be bridged on many different chains. There is an ongoing governance proposal to deploy the protocol on Polygon allowing anyone to natively mint agEUR from there.\n\nAt the moment, the PoS bridge is the only way to bridge agEUR to Polygon. But with the potential upcoming launch of the borrowing module, new bridge solutions will be added, like Layer Zero.\n\nThere are so far more than 3m agEUR on Polygon with deep liquidity [on Uniswap](https://info.uniswap.org/#/polygon/pools/0x3fa147d6309abeb5c1316f7d8a7d8bd023e0cd80) and on [Curve](https://polygon.curve.fi/factory/209). \nBesides Uniswap and Curve on Polygon, agEUR has deep liquidity on UniswapV3, Sushiswap and Curve on mainnet. The stablecoin can be minted at oracle value meaning liquidity for it could be theorically infinite.\n\nStablecoin is also available on Fantom, Harmony, BSC, Avalanche, Solana, NEAR, Aurora, Fuse, with plans for deployment on other chains where Aave is supported like Arbitrum and Optimism.\n\nThe stablecoin is over-collateralized (current collateral ratio = 180%), it is backed by USDC, DAI, FEI and FRAX. The protocol insures itself against the $/€ change risk by issuing perpetual futures and by the deposits of another type of agent incentivized by the strategies built by the protocol (involving lending to Aave).\nThe protocol has also launched a new module that allows people to borrow agEUR against wETH, wstETH and wBTC. It is this version of the protocol that will deployed on Polygon and then on other chains.\n\n## Links\n\n- Official: https://angle.money\n- Docs: https://docs.angle.money\n- Token Contracts: [Mainnet](https://etherscan.io/token/0x1a7e4e63778b4f12a199c062f3efdd288afcbce8), [Polygon](https://polygonscan.com/address/0xe0b52e49357fd4daf2c15e02058dce6bc0057db4).

This would provide a use case that exists nowhere else in DeFi around agEUR: the opportunity to long the € and short the $ through agEUR.\n\nRight now it is possible to borrow agEUR, but not to borrow from agEUR: like you could borrow USDC or another USD stablecoin, swap it for agEUR (with little slippage) and hence get a short on the $/long on the €. This may not be the trend of the moment but definitely something to consider for the future.\n\nRelative to the size of agEUR on Aave, there’s also agEUR liquidity available for this kind of opportunities at the moment.\n\nDoing this in isolation mode would mean this asset would induce very small risk for the Aave protocol as a whole.\n\n\n\n## Risk Parameters\n\nWith the liquidity on Polygon in mind, I propose the following risk parameter linked to the isolation mode. Obviously this is a first proposition and governance/risk team is more suited to choose better risk parameters.\n\nV3 Isolation mode: 60% LTV, 80% liquidation threshold, 20% reserve factor, 3M$ debt ceiling. This is a conservative debt ceiling, given the mainnet liquidity we could also imagine efficient cross-chain liquidators coming to liquidate even if liquidity is too small on Polygon\n\n## Specifications \n\n**1. What is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset?**  \nAs mentioned in the disclaimer, I am a Core Contributor of the Angle Protocol.\n\n**2. Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token**  \nSee agEUR summary section\n\n**3. Explain positioning of token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset?**  \nSee Benefits for Aave section.\n\n**4. Provide a brief history of the project and the different components: DAO (is it live?), products (are the live?).**  \n\nAngle Protocol is a decentralized stablecoin protocol, it is ruled by the ANGLE token and more generally by the veANGLE token. Like many other projects, Angle DAO has indeed adopted the ve tokenomics. \n\nThe platform was released [on November 3rd 2021.](https://blog.angle.money/angle-is-live-on-the-ethereum-mainnet-a8253162daf0).\nANGLE locking went live [in January](https://blog.angle.money/veangle-is-live-on-mainnet-4d702fcf7584). Votes by veANGLE holders are implemented by a 4/6 multisig composed of 3 core team members (including myself), [Julien Bouteloup](https://twitter.com/bneiluj), [0xMaki](https://twitter.com/0xMaki) and [SebVentures](https://twitter.com/SebVentures).\n\n**5. How is the asset currently used?**  \n\nThe asset is a € stablecoin. It is used by people as a means of exchange to pay in Euros in DeFi, or to keep a stable asset value in reserves before aping in elsewhere.\n\nIt is also used as a way to get yield in many places in DeFi\n\n**6. Emission schedule**  \n\nToken can only be issued following the rules of the protocol on mainnet: at oracle value if someone has provided either USDC, DAI, FEI, FRAX, or wETH. agEUR can also be borrowed from Angle Borrowing module at a 0.5% rate. \nThere’s no emission schedule for the token.\n\n**7. Token (& Protocol) permissions (minting) and upgradability. Is there a multisig? What can it do? Who are the signers?**  \n\nagEUR token contract on mainnet is upgradeable and can be upgraded by the [multisig ](https://gnosis-safe.io/app/eth:0xdC4e6DFe07EFCa50a197DF15D9200883eF4Eb1c8/balances) described above.\nagEUR on Polygon can also be upgraded by a [multisig on Polygon](https://polygonscan.com/address/0xdA2D2f638D6fcbE306236583845e5822554c02EA).\n\n**8.

        "body": "Author: Alchemix Core Team\nForum Post: https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-add-alusd-as-borrowable-to-aave-v2/7191\n\n# Summary\nThe purpose of this AIP is to list alUSD as a borrowable asset on Aave. alUSD has established itself as one of the leading new stablecoins in terms of stability and liquidity, and listing on Aave will provide users with a proven stablecoin to borrow. Alchemix has 376m TVL in the form of yvDAI and DAI backing alUSD, with a liquid supply of 239m alUSD. alUSD has one of the deepest Curve pools, with ~450m in liquidity. In addition to the Curve pool, alUSD has additional liquidity on Sushiswap, Saddle, and mStable. According to Parsec Finance’s StableRank, alUSD is routinely among the top stablecoins in terms of price stability and liquidity within 1% slippage. Having been on the market for over 6 months while maintaining the peg through turbulent market conditions, alUSD has built the reputation required to be an asset listed on AAVE.\n\n[alUSD StableRank Screenshot](https://imgur.com/a/iMyToUj)\n\n# About Alchemix and alUSD\nAlchemix is an evolution of the tried and true CDP model trailblazed by MakerDAO. Alchemix is, at its core, an overcollateralized stablecoin, much like DAI and other similar tokens. It has some key differences however.\n\nAlchemix only mints like-kind or “mirror” al-Assets. For example, alUSD is only mintable by DAI (and later USDT and USDC), and alETH is only mintable by ETH (and later other ETH derivatives). Deposited collateral is then deployed to yearn, of which the earned yield doubly repays users’ debt and backs the dollar peg in the Transmuter module. In addition, there is no interest paid in the borrowing of al-Assets. Due to this structure, Alchemix does not have liquidations in its system. This allows people to maximum borrow without fear of shifting market conditions - taking an essentially risk free negative interest alUSD loan with their DAI. In effect, the system acts as a way to get an advance on your yield for your stablecoin deposits.\n\nAlchemix ensures the alUSD peg with the following mechanisms.\n1. 50% LTV for minting alUSD, which prevents excessive recursive leverage in the protocol.\n2. DAO-managed debt caps that limit the over-minting of alUSD\n3. The ability to repay debt in alUSD or DAI. If alUSD is under the peg, people can buy it off the market and repay their loan at a discount. If alUSD is over the peg, users can sell alUSD to DAI and repay with DAI to arbitrage the price, and they can self-liquidate their collateral to mint more alUSD to trade to DAI for arbitrage.\n4. The Transmuter module guarantees 1:1 conversions of alUSD to DAI, the conversion process isn’t instant, but it can present good arbitrage opportunities, which helps to stabilize the peg.\n5. Alchemix rewards ALCX governance tokens for alUSD liquidity providers, which attracts liquidity to the pool, further boosting the peg.\n\nalUSD minted from a new loan has a collateralization ratio of 200%, while alUSD minted from repaid debt has a collateralization ratio of 100%. The total global collateralization ratio for alUSD is 157%. The supply can expand in two ways – an expansion in the debt ceiling followed by users taking new loans, or debt repayments with DAI, which decrement the global debt while not destroying alUSD. This is how we have a supply of ~239m with a current debt cap of 150m. alUSD can be burned by staking it in the transmuter, where it is converted 1:1 to DAI over time.\n\nThese mechanisms in tandem have allowed for alUSD to remain extremely close to the $1 peg since its inception.\n\n# Motivation\nalUSD has established itself as a reliable and liquid stablecoin. In addition to protocol improvements, Alchemix DAO believes that integrating alUSD throughout DeFi will help us in that goal. Because AAVE is the leading lending protocol across all of crypto, getting on AAVE as a borrowable asset would lend a lot of legitimacy to alUSD. The more tightly integrated alUSD is within DeFi, the more resilient it will become, which will allow alUSD to safely grow in supply.\n\nGoing forward, Alchemix will expand beyond our current set up of using DAI in the yvDAI yearn vault as collateral, and expand the selection of stablecoin collaterals and yield earning strategies. AAVE is one such source of yield that we are looking to plug into in the future. When these upgrades take place, we predict that Alchemix will be one of the larger liquidity providers to AAVE, similar to how Alchemix is currently one of the largest liquidity providers on Yearn.\n\n# alUSD Benefits to Aave Users\nalUSD is desirable to borrow because it is tightly pegged to DAI, USDC, USDT, mUSD, FEI, FRAX, and LUSD in our various markets. It is simple to swap between other stables. DEX aggregators make it simple to trade between alUSD and any other asset on Ethereum too. In addition, there are attractive farming incentives for alUSD LPs. For people that are looking to borrow alUSD but don’t have stablecoins from which to mint it, borrowing alUSD on AAVE will provide more options to get alUSD. The alUSD can be used for yield farming, or through highly liquid swaps into other stable coins, to finance their personal life or to speculate on the market. alUSD is also used in an alETH/alUSD options market on premia.finance. Alchemix plans to continue to expand alUSD use cases in the future through partnerships and integrations.\n\n# Security Considerations and Risk Analysis\nCertik Audit for the Core Contracts: https://alchemix.fi/a208baf6ca7e0d6b0116461f05e27cd9.pdf\n\nCurrently, the Alchemix protocol can be paused or modified by a multisig. The protocol controls the alUSD debt cap and collateralization ratio through DAO voting, which is then executed by a community + developer multisig + timelock contract. The DAO prioritizes peg stability above all else when considering parameter changes.\n\nAave has already conducted risk analysis on DAI, the current sole backing stablecoin of alUSD, and assigned an overall risk rating of B+ [Risks per Asset - Risk](https://docs.aave.com/risk/asset-risk/risks-per-asset). USDC and USDT strategies will be added as alUSD collateral later. USDC and USDT have ratings of A- and B+ respectively. The new risks from introducing alUSD are Alchemix/alUSD and Yearn Vault contract risks. Risk to Aave is minimized due to alUSD being enabled for borrowing but not as collateral.\n\nThe Alchemix DAO multisig and timelock wallet is the administrator for the alUSD token. It has the ability to grant and revoke other contracts the minter role. Currently, all alUSD minting is handled by the alchemist.sol contract. When we launch our version two, the new contracts will also be granted the minting permissions. Alchemix employs a modular approach where the Transmuter and Vault Adapter modules can be swapped out and replaced with upgraded versions. The core alchemist.sol contract cannot be upgraded, but the multisig and timelock wallet can change the following parameters: collateralization ratio, debt ceiling, and fee percentage. Each member of the core Alchemix development team has permission to enable Alchemix’s sentinel mode, which pauses the contract in case of an emergency.\n\n# Protocol Data\n### Market data (Market Cap, 24h Volume, Volatility, Exchanges, Maturity)\n- Market Cap - 242,165,957 USD.\n- 24h Volume - typically ranges between 1-4m.\n- Markets: Curve, Saddle, Sushi, mStable, Premia\n\n### Social Channels data (Size of communities, activity on github)\n- Twitter: 40.2k\n- Discord: 7.5k\n- Medium: 1.7k\n\n### Contracts date of deployments, number of transactions, number of holders for tokens:\n- alUSD Deployment Date: 2/27/2021\n- Transactions: 49,594\n- Token Holders: 1328\n\n# Implementation\nThe alUSD price oracle will be served via Chainlink.

        "body": "Author: QiDao Protocol core team\nForum post: https://governance.aave.com/t/add-mai-on-aave-v3/7630\n\nProposal to add support for MAI (aka miMatic) on Aave V3 (On Polygon, Fantom, and Avalanche)\n\n### Summary\n\nMAI is the first and largest stablecoin project on Polygon and Fantom. It is an overcollateralized stablecoin that is non-custodial. All MAI is backed by collateral locked in user-managed vaults. MAI minting is available on 8 chains, and bridging to 18 chains.\n\nAll accepted collaterals are priced using Chainlink price feeds. MAI has stayed within its peg through several market downturns.\n\nThere’s around 250M MAI minted, with liquidity on all top DEXs in which MAI is present. A significant portion of liquidity for MAI is on Curve. MAI hosts the largest pool on Curve Polygon and the pool with most volume on Curve Fantom.\n\n### Risk Parameters\n\n* V3 Efficiency mode stablecoins: 97% LTV, 98% Liquidation threshold, 10% reserve factor\n* V3 Isolation mode: 75% LTV, 80% liquidation threshold, 10% reserve factor, $50M initial debt ceiling per chain\n\n### Specifications\n\n1. What is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset?\n\nCore team at QiDao Protocol.\n\n2. Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token\n\nMAI is the first and largest stablecoin protocol on Polygon. It allows users to lock their tokens and use them as collateral to mint MAI at 0% interest.\n\nMAI is an overcollateralized CDP stablecoin on Polygon, Avalanche, Fantom, Arbitrum, Harmony, Moonriver, and Gnosis Chain. MAI is one of the most crosschain assets in DeFi, currently on 18 chains through Multichain. Accepted collateral includes interest-bearing assets like Aave Market Tokens. Users are not charged interest for borrowing MAI - instead, they are charged a 0.5% fee upon repayment.\n\nDespite market downturns during its existence, MAI has maintained its peg.\n\nMAI currently has a TVL of around $350M, and has around 250M MAI outstanding.\n\n3. Explain positioning of the token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset?\nBeing the largest native stablecoin on Polygon and Fantom, MAI has a wide reach within the native projects on those chains. Listing MAI would connect Aave to most communities in these chains through the integrations already made by MAI.\n\nMAI is one of the most crosschain assets, available on 18 chains through canonical bridging. As a result, users will be drawn to borrow MAI to bridge value to other chains and take advantage of the many yield opportunities that MAI has.\n\nMAI’s risk profile is low. It is used by large institutions like Celsius and Polygon. MAI has also received grants from several blockchains, including Polygon, Fantom, Harmony, Aurora, and IoTeX.\n\n4. Provide a brief history of the project and the different components: DAO (is it live?), products (are the live?). How did it overcome some of the challenges it faced?\n\n* MAI is governed by the QiDao Protocol, a community-run DAO around the QI token.\n* Several other projects have participated in our DAO through proposals and bribing, including Frax Finance, Stake DAO, Celsius, * PolygonDAO, SpiritSwap, SpookySwap, Gotchi Vault, and Beefy Finance\n* The Polygon Alliance was recently set up to participate in QiDao.\n\n5. How is the asset currently used?\n\n* Lending (Market.xyz, Impermax, Tarot)\n* Listed on several DEXs on 18 chains. Main DEXs are Curve, Balancer, QuickSwap, SpookySwap, SpiritSwap, Solidly, Saber, and TombSwap\n* Top two pools on Curve Fantom and Polygon\n* MAI is used by Celsius to borrow against their AUM\n* MAI has been used by Polygon to award bounties\n* MAI offers low-cost leverage to strategies on Stake DAO, Yearn, Beefy, and Aave\n\n6. Emission schedule\n\nUsers can mint MAI by locking up their assets and borrowing against that value at 0% interest. Temporary debt ceilings serve as the a supply mitigation.\n\n7. Token (& Protocol) permissions (minting) and upgradability. Is there a multisig? What can it do? Who are the signers?\n\nAll funds stored as collateral are fully controlled by users\nThere is a 3/5 multisig, comprised by the QiDao team. Team members are doxxed and regularly appear on podcasts, live streams, and crypto conferences\nThe multisig executes the results of Snapshot votes: liquidation ratios for new collaterals, partnerships, and debt ceilings. There have been over 70 votes since the start of the DAO: see votes here 1.\nSince the protocol uses canonical bridging, QiDao retains the power to mint MAI on chains it is bridged to.\n\n8. Market data (Market Cap, 24h Volume, Volatility, Exchanges, Maturity)\n\n* Market Cap: ~$250M\n* 24h Volume: >$40M\n* Volatility: Low\n* Exchanges: Curve, Balancer, QuickSwap, SpookySwap, SpiritSwap, Saber, Beethoven, Solidly, TombSwap, Solarbeam, Trader Joe, Crodex, ZoomSwap, PaintSwap, Elk Finance, and Rose\n* Maturity: Launched 5/4/21\n\n9. Social channels data (Size of communities, activity on Github)\n* Project: https://www.mai.finance/\n* Defillama: https://defillama.com/protocol/qidao\n* Whitepaper: https://docs.mai.finance/\n* Document portal: https://docs.mai.finance/\n* Source code for the system(s) that interact with the proposed asset: https://github.com/0xlaozi\n* Twitter: 17k followers: https://twitter.com/QiDaoProtocol\n* Telegram: 2,130 members: @QiDaoProtocol\n* Discord: 8,987 members: https://discord.com/qidaoprotocol\n\n10.

Constant internal reviews are performed to ensure MAI’s economic and technical safety.\n\nThe protocol currently has around $350M TVL.\n\nFirst audit: https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/606120c25fb119221b762612/60bd3b9a1366549deb6a1cf7_Mai_Finance_Audit_Bramah.pdf\n\nSecond audit: https://cloakwire.com/qi-dao-security-audit/\n\n### Other links\n\nContract addresses: https://docs.mai.finance/functions/smart-contract-addresses\n\nChainlink Oracle: 0xd8d483d813547CfB624b8Dc33a00F2fcbCd2D428 (Polygon), 0x5D1F504211c17365CA66353442a74D4435A8b778 (Avalanche), 0x827863222c9C603960dE6FF2c0dD58D457Dcc363 (Fantom)\n\n### Voting options\n\nYES, add MAI on Aave v3\nNO, do not add MAI on Aave v3",
