This proposal follows the fast-track process for increasing supply caps as outlined [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-v3-supply-borrow-cap-management-fast-track-process/8045). Itâ€™s important to note that these are initial supply caps for these assets and will be iterated upon. The recommendations for every asset on every chain take into consideration:\n\n- Asset Market Cap\n- Asset Counter Party Risk\n- Asset Volume\n- Asset Liquidity (DEX and CEX based)\n- Historical Liquidations in times of high volatility\n\n## Uncapped Assets\n\n### Avalanche\n![Screen Shot 2022-11-23 at 3.37.03 PM.png](ipfs://bafkreihvcnaftfhykgzuzqfw4alzlwworgz2v6s26g6acdf4r7twhle4zy)\n     \n \n### Optimism\n![Screen Shot 2022-11-23 at 3.37.19 PM.png](ipfs://bafkreibhe4qkdrhmymwxxk7vjtfugtmtkharmhdknaxdcvhgncej2w5tse)\n\n### Arbitrum \n![Screen Shot 2022-11-23 at 3.37.40 PM.png](ipfs://bafkreif3ttgogflynnmo7gxqjfhsbvzkpae6skmj2fx6p7vk55byony624)\n*TVL of the deepest pool, captured on 11/22/22\n\n",
