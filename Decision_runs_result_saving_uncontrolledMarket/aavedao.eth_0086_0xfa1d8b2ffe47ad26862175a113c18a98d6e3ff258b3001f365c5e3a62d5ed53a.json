To ensure USR remains overcollateralized, Resolv operates the Resolv Liquidity Pool (RLP), which serves as a liquid insurance reserve. Details relating to onboarding USR can be found here.\n\nwstUSR is the wrapped version of stUSR, staked USR. wstUSR, like wstETH is designed for better compatibility with DeFi protocols. [42.65%](https://etherscan.io/token/0x66a1e37c9b0eaddca17d3662d6c05f4decf3e110#balances) of USR on Ethereum is staked and further insights are available on this Dune [dashboard](https://dune.com/saul/resolv-labs-dashboard). Staked USR holders receive 70% of the Base Rewards from the Collateral Pool which consists of the ETH, USDC and USDT used to mint USR.\n\n### Collateral Pool\n\nThe Collateral Pool holds the assets backing USR and is structured to generate yield while mitigating exposure to ETH price fluctuations by employing hedging strategies similar to those used by Ethena. 70% of the Base Reward generated by the Collateral Pool are directed to staked USR holders. The other 30% is allocated to the insurance like asset RLP.\n\nThe composition of the Collateral Pool ($653.65M) is majority ETH-correlated ($582.65M), 56.8% of which is wstETH, and the remainder ($71.00M) held in stablecoins. The assets are currently allocated as shown below:\n\n* 55.1% held in [on-chain treasury](https://app.resolv.xyz/overview)\n* 24.7% secured in institutional custody—leveraging Ceffu for Binance collateral and Fireblocks for Deribit; and,\n* 20.2% is allocated to exchanges, including Binance Hyperliquid and Deribit.\n\nFurthermore, to efficiently manage short-term liquidity demands, such as redemptions or margin requirements, [Resolv utilizes Aave v3](https://docs.resolv.xyz/litepaper/protocol-mechanics/collateral-pool/liquidity-management) on Ethereum to borrow WETH against wstETH.\n\n![Screenshot 2025-02-23 at 14.31.38](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rJFLZhO9Je.png)\n\nAt the time of writing, the Collateral Pool is generating a return of [5.69%](https://app.resolv.xyz/overview) and staked USR is providing a [7.12%](https://app.resolv.xyz/overview) return to stakers.\n\n## Ongoing Points Campaign\n\nResolv is currently running a points-based incentive campaign, with Season 1 scheduled to conclude between the end of Q1 and the beginning of Q2. As part of this initiative, wstUSR holders earn 5 points per wstUSR held daily, providing an additional incentive for participation.\n\n# Specification\n\nTicker: wstUSR\n\nContract address on mainnet: 0x1202F5C7b4B9E47a1A484E8B270be34dbbC75055\n\nChainlink oracle: upcoming\n\nProject: https://resolv.xyz/\n\nCollateral pool addresses: https://app.resolv.xyz/overview\n\nGitHub: https://github.com/resolv-im\n\nDocs: https://docs.resolv.xyz/litepaper\n\nAudit: https://docs.resolv.xyz/litepaper/resources/security\n\nTwitter: https://x.com/resolvlabs\n\nRisk Parameters will be provided by Risk Services Providers at the earliest possible and ARFC will be updated with that feedback.\n\n# Disclosure\n\nThe ACI and TokenLogic are not directly affiliated with Resolv and did not receive compensation for creation this proposal.\n\n# Next Steps\n\n1.

By leveraging multi-party computation, FBTC strengthens bridge security, safeguarding user assets and ensuring robust cross-chain interoperability. This setup also integrates a cross-chain hub, allowing seamless BTC transfers while reducing issues linked to Bitcoin L2 growth.\n\nThis new asset will broaden opportunities for Bitcoin holders aiming to participate in DeFi on Aave v3. The introduction of FBTC offers users more flexibility in leveraging their Bitcoin, enhancing liquidity and driving increased engagement within the Aave protocol.\n\nWith $480M in total value locked (TVL), FBTC is emerging as a compelling solution in Bitcoin bridging, supported by its upcoming Chainlink Oracle integration to accelerate growth across EVM networks. Aave stands to gain significantly as a primary partner in this expansion, following the successful playbook of cbBTC, which quickly scaled through similar collaborative efforts.\n\nSpecification\nTicker: FBTC\n\nContract address on mainnet: 0xC96dE26018A54D51c097160568752c4E3BD6C364\n\nChainlink oracle: upcoming\n\nProject: https://fbtc.com/\n\nReserves addresses: Bitcoin Reserve Address | FBTC\n\nProof of Assets dashboard: FBTC proof of assets dashboard\n\nGitHub: GitHub - fbtc-xyz/fbtc-contract\n\nDocs: https://docs.fbtc.com/\n\nAudit: fbtc-contract/audits at main · fbtc-xyz/fbtc-contract · GitHub\n\nTwitter: x.com\n\nRisk Parameters will be provided by Risk Services Providers at the earliest possible and ARFC will be updated with that feedback.\n\nDisclosure\nThe ACI is not directly affiliated with Ignition and did not receive compensation for creation this proposal.\n\nNext Steps\nIf consensus is reached on this [TEMP CHECK], escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\nIf the Snapshot outcome is YAE, this proposal will be escalated to ARFC stage.\nPublish a standard ARFC, collect community & service providers feedback before escalating proposal to ARFC snapshot stage.\nIf the ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, publish an AIP vote for final confirmation and enforcement of the proposal\nCopyright\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.",

        "body": "---\n### [TEMP CHECK] Onboard osGNO to Aave v3 Gnosis\n### Author: ACI\n###  Date: 2024-07-29\n---\n\n### **Summary**\n\nThis proposal aims to Onboard osGNO, the Liquid Staking Token (LST) of StakeWise V3 into the GnosisMarket. By integrating osGNO, Aave users will be provided with additional liquidity and yield opportunities while supporting the growth of LSTs within the DeFi ecosystem on Gnosis Chain.\n\n### **Motivation**\n\nGNO is used for governance within the GnosisDAO and acts as a staking token for Gnosis Chain. \n\nosGNO is a Liquid Staking Token (LST) representing GNO staked in StakeWise V3 on Gnosis Chain. It can be minted from any Vault created in StakeWise on Gnosis in order to make a user’s stake liquid. Users have the option of staking in one of the Vaults in the Marketplace to mint osGNO, creating their own Vault as a solo staker and minting osGNO from there, or purchasing osGNO directly on a DEX.\n\nCreating Vaults and staking in them is a permissionless process on StakeWise, and so is access to osGNO. For additional protection, every minted osGNO has an excess backing of staked tokens, provided by the minters themselves.  \n\nosGNO increases in value relative to GNO as staking rewards accrue, it can be redeemed for the underlying GNO within Vaults using the redemption mechanism detailed [here](https://docs.stakewise.io/protocol-overview-in-depth/oseth#redemption-mechanism). If there are not sufficient liquid reserves available for redemption, there may be delays in unstaking and redeeming the osGNO for underlying GNO which could result in a temporary depeg.\n\nosETH was recently added as collateral on Aave v3 Ethereum and has seen good adoption. In order to improve Aave’s marketshare on Gnosis Cchain, and support the Gnosis and StakeWise ecosystems it is proposed to also Onboard osGNO into Gnosis Market.\n\n### **Proof of Liquidity and Deposit Commitments**\n\nPotential POL and Deposit Commitments will be discussed at ARFC stage.\n\n### **Specification**\n\nContract address: 0xF490c80aAE5f2616d3e3BDa2483E30C4CB21d1A0\n\nRisk Parameters will be provided at ARFC Stage by Risk Service Providers.\n\n### **Useful Links:**\n\nosGNO announcement post: https://stakewise.medium.com/announcing-the-launch-of-stakewise-v3-on-gnosis-chain-0231285bd8e3\n\nosGNO Vaults: https://app.stakewise.io/vaults\n\n### **Disclaimer:**\n\nThis proposal is powered by Skywards.

        "body": "## Author: @Trident Digital Technologies\n## Date: 2024-11-05\n\n---\n\n### Summary\n\nThe proposal aims to onboard Paxos PAXG stablecoin, to the Aave v3 protocol Main Instance on Ethereum. $25K in lending incentives will be available over the three months following launch of the initiative, additionally further rewards may be made made available based on performance and/or utilization targets of the pool if for ex. significant TVL milestones are hit.\n\n### **Motivation**\n\nPAXG, a gold backed digital currency offered by Paxos is NYDFS approved and has a multi year track record on chain. With Paxos as a centralised and trusted entity in the cryptocurrency industry, PAXG brings a unique value proposition focused as the premier on chain gold asset\n\nOnboarding Paxos's PAXG extends Aave Protocol's already diverse collateral offering to its users. PAXG users on Aave Protocol will be able to utilize the value of their holdings without giving up their exposure to gold. Introducing PAXG is expected to increase liquidity and engagement within the protocol.\n\nOnboarding PAXG aligns with Aave DAO commitment to offering diversification across widely held and in-demand resources. It will enable users to tap into Paxos’s liquidity and reputation while benefiting from Aave’s established lending and borrowing functionalities. PAXG is expected to benefit from a major integration like Aave Protocol and over time is expected to attract more mainstream users to Aave, contributing to the overall growth and adoption of both on-chain gold and the Aave protocol.\n\n### **Specification**\n\nTicker: PAXG\n\nContract address: 0x45804880De22913dAFE09f4980848ECE6EcbAf78\n\nRisk Parameters will be provided by Risk Services Providers at the earliest possible and ARFC will be updated with that feedback.\n\n### **Disclosure**\n\nTrident is affiliated with Paxos and may receive compensation for efforts undertaken herein. ACI (Aave Chan Initiative) is not afiliated with Paxos and has not received compensation for escalating this proposal.\n\n### **Next Steps**\n\n1. If consensus is reached on this [TEMP CHECK], escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n2. If the Snapshot outcome is YAE, this proposal will be escalated to ARFC stage.\n3. Publication of a standard ARFC, collect community & service providers feedback before escalating proposal to ARFC snapshot stage.\n4.

        "body": "---\n\nTitle: [TEMP CHECK] Onboard RSR to Aave v3 \n\nAuthor: Reserve Protocol Core Team & ACI (Aave Chan Initiative)\n\nCreated: 2024-01-24\n\n---\n\n# Summary:\n\nThe Reserve Protocol Core Team proposes adding Reserve Rights (RSR) as an asset in AAVE V3 on Ethereum Mainnet. Reserve drives liquidity on AAVE lending markets through the underlying baskets of RToken collateral and demand for borrowing RSR will bring additional fees to AAVE. Reserve will also make available Curve ecosystem voting power to deepen GHO liquidity through a GHO-eUSD Curve pool.\n\n# Motivation:\n\nReserve is a free, permissionless platform on Ethereum mainnet to build, deploy and govern asset-backed currencies referred to as “RTokens.” RTokens are always 1:1 asset-backed, allowing for permissionless minting and redeeming on-chain by users without the need for any middlemen. The Reserve Protocol launched on Ethereum mainnet in Oct 2022, Base in Oct 2023, and completed its fifth audit in Feb 2023.\n\nRSR is the governance token for Reserve Protocol and can be staked on a particular RToken, where it has two roles:\n\n1. RToken Overcollateralization: Staked RSR receives a portion of the RToken collateral’s revenue in exchange for being the first capital-at-risk in the case of collateral default\n\n2. RToken Governance: Staked RSR proposes and votes on changes to the RToken’s configuration\n\nRSR contract has been live on ethereum for 1.5 years, has undergone audits by Solidified, and the dev team recently burned the multisig Pause Transfer functionality, making it immutable. RSR currently has a marketcap of $139m.\n\nThree of the RTokens already live on the protocol are High Yield USD (hyUSD) is a secure high yield savings dollar with up to 8% APY expected to outpace the rate of inflation in over 100 countries around the world. ETHPlus (ETH+) is a safety-first diversified ETH staking index with up to 4.5% APY. Electronic Dollar (eUSD) is a hyper-resilient stablecoin built to endure black swan events, recently proving itself during the run on Silicon Valley Bank.\n\n## Benefits of listing RSR:\n\nAn RSR lending market would fuel Reserve Protocol growth and TVL across Ethereum and Base networks. As the Reserve ecosystem expands, AAVE TVL grows because a portion of RToken collateral assets are held on AAVE lending markets for example, the largest RToken is currently eUSD ($17.7m TVL) which holds 50% of its collateral basket in USDC and USDT lending on AAVE.\n\nAdditionally, demand for RSR borrowing could create more fees for Aave.\n\nReserve Protocol is also open to providing seed liquidity for the asset.\n\n# Useful Links:\n\nProject: https://reserve.org/\nProtocol Documentation: Reserve Protocol Docs\nRSR Documentation: Reserve Protocol Docs | RSR\nGithub/Source Code: Reserve · GitHub\nRSR Contract (Ethereum): Reserve Rights: RSR Token | Address 0x320623b8E4fF03373931769A31Fc52A4E78B5d70 | Etherscan\nRSR Oracle: Chainlink: RSR / USD Price Feed | Address 0x759bBC1be8F90eE6457C44abc7d443842a976d02 | Etherscan\nDune Dashboard: https://dune.com/reserve-protocol/reserve-protocol-overview\nBlog: https://blog.reserve.org/\nAudits: Reserve has been audited 5 times, RSR was audited by Solidified\nCommunities: Discord 3K, Twitter 111K, 104 GitHub stars\nRSR Price: CoinGecko, CoinMarketCap\n\n\n# Disclaimer:\n\nThis proposal is powered by Skywards.
