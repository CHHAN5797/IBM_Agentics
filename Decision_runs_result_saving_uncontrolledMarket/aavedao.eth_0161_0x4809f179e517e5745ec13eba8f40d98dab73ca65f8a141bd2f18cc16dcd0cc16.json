        "body": "# Summary\nProposal to pre-approve the activation of Aave v3.2 across all Aave pool instances, a new version of v3 (currently v.3.1) including two important changes:\n\n- A new feature: Liquid eModes.\n- The removal of all deprecated stable rate logic.\n\n\n# Context\nJuly 27th, Aave governance proposal 132 3 activated Aave v3.1 across all active networks. This currently active version of the Aave protocol was focused on security improvements (e.g. introducing virtual accounting), changing the architecture of the interest rate strategies, and multiple other updates to improve the operational efficiency of the system.\n\nAdditionally, with Aave v3.1 we introduced Aave v3 Origin 4, a new repository for the Aave protocol (Foundry-based) to serve as the cornerstone to release further post-v3.1 versions faster while keeping maximum security standards.\n\nOne and a half months later, as a result of previous groundwork with v3.1 and Origin, we are glad to present to the community this new Aave v3.2 version.\n\n## Aave v3.2\nThe changes included in Aave v3.2 are more isolated than those of v3.1, and of different nature. While removing stable rate-related logic is more on the maintenance/codebase cleanup side, liquid eModes is a total user-facing and powerful feature.\n\n### 1 -  Liquid eModes\n\nAave v3 introduced the concept of eMode (efficiency mode), an abstraction within the pool for configuring groups of assets with more capital-efficient risk configurations (LTV, Liquidation Threshold). This unlocked use cases like native high-leverage or even strategies between stablecoins. eMode could be deemed one of the first experiments in DeFi at scale with the concept of pools of assets within pools of assets.\n\nThe eMode feature has seen since then tremendous success, enabling use cases like ETH-correlated eMode, allowing for higher than default risk parameters on ETH LSTs/ETH positions (or MATIC, AVAX with their LSTs). However, the eMode feature always had some room for improvement, that way truly unlocking even more powerful use cases and flexibility on Aave.\n\nA known technical limitation of the initial iteration of eMode is the following: a single eMode is optionally assigned to assets listed on Aave. That means that if let’s say WETH is assigned eMode 1 eligibility (ETH-correlated, with ETH LSTs), WETH can’t be eligible for any other eMode.\n\nIn different scenarios, this is an important constraint, as currently is not possible to have on the same Aave pool an eMode with wstETH and WETH, together with a different eMode with weETH and WETH, as WETH can only be in one of them at the same time.\n\n\n\nThe new Liquid eMode feature of Aave v3.2 removes the previous constraint: an asset listed on Aave can be eligible for different eModes, and then it only depends on the user to choose which eMode he wants to enter to.\n\nFor example, with liquid eModes, a possible configuration not doable before would be:\n\n- eMode 1, with wstETH, weETH and WETH.\n- eMode 2, with wstETH and WETH.\n- eMode 3, with weETH and WETH.\n- eMode 4, with WETH and GHO.\n\nSo then, user A holding the wstETH and weETH collaterals, could borrow WETH at high LTV. User B holding only wstETH could borrow WETH at high (but different) LTV. User C holding only weETH could similarly borrow WETH at a different LTV than the previous two eModes. User D could have a position with WETH collateral and GHO borrowings.\n\nThis doesn’t stop there, as more sophisticated configuration strategies could be adopted, like:\n\n- eMode for only WETH and stablecoins.\n- eMode for onboarding less mature LSTs, without requiring them being together with all major LSTs.\n\nFor extra configuration flexibility, liquid eModes also allow now to flag an asset as only borrowable, only collateral, or both, in the context of an eMode. For example, in a hypothetic eMode with only wstETH and WETH, the normal configuration would be wstETH as only collateral and WETH as only borrowable, fully focusing on the wstETH leverage use-case.\n\n\n\nIn addition to the previous main characteristics of liquid eModes, we have also introduced the following minor changes to the system:\n\n- Now the protocol doesn’t enforce the LTV/LT of an asset being lower outside its eligible eModes. However, the validation gets stricter on the user side when entering any eMode (or from no-eMode): Health Factor is always validated to never allow the user to get his position below 1HF post-eMode swap.\n- The protocol previously had an eMode-specific price feed, to be used to price with the same feed all assets on an eMode. However, this has never been used, and its utility (in its current form) is quite arguable. Therefore, we have to remove it from the data structure to allow more efficient storage allocation.\n- On a technical note, before 3.2, the eMode of an asset was stored on the asset’s data itself. Now, the eMode data stores all the necessary information for the protocol to understand which assets are eligible on that eMode.\n- Similar as with previous upgrades on Aave v3, we have tried to follow a non-invasive approach when adding the feature, only touching/refactoring those pieces that were clearly necessary, but without doing any big high-level refactoring of the pool.\n\n### 2 - Stable rate logic cleanup\n\nPart of the v.3.1 upgrade was the addition of a function swapToVariable() for anybody to permissionless off-board stable borrowings to variable, that way factually deprecating completely stable rate on Aave pools.\n\nWith currently no active stable rate position (moved via the Dolce Vita program by the service provider ACI 4), we have executed a follow-up step on the process: completely removing the stable rate logic from the protocol, which one hand simplifies the codebase, but on the other hand it also slightly optimises gas consumption and logic flows.\n\nEven if fairly extensive change, this cleanup is non-invasive in how the protocol operates given that there are no active stable rate positions. All technical details about it will be included in the upcoming v3.2 release technical changelog.\n\n## Security\nIn addition to all standard internal procedures on BGD Labs (testing, review), the external security processes are getting finished. Before the final AIP, they will be properly communicated in the Aave governance forum.\n\nSimilar as with any other Aave v3 upgrades, the AIP proposal will include compensation for the cost of the external security procedures.",

        "body": "# Summary\n\nAs continuation of the engagement finished 1st October, present to the Aave DAO a proposal for BGD to continue as provider of development and security coordinator services.\n\n\n# Motivation\n\nTime flies in DeFi, and it has already been two and a half years since BGD started working for the Aave DAO.\nDuring this time, the market has gone up and down, new protocols have appeared, and CEXes have fallen. But the Aave protocol remains, and, following almost any metric, it has grown.\n\nTogether with the work of other service providers, we want to believe our contribution has had an important role in both the stability of Aave (creating solid trust) and the growth itself, with tech enabling all new types of use cases while maintaining the highest standards of security.\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\nDuring the last 3 engagements between BGD Labs and the Aave DAO, all pieces of the Aave infrastructure have been worked on: the Aave protocol itself with new versions and maintaining the current ones, the Aave governance, bridging infrastructure, all rails for expansion to new networks and use cases, supporting non-technical contributors to maximise their value without being blocked by tech; basically everything.\n\nThe motivation/goal of this new engagement is:\n\n- Keep the stability and trust in the Aave technology.\n- Innovate responsibly on production systems.\n- Support all other non-tech contributors to the DAO, accelerating progress.\n\nIn summary, the same as before, but always striving for better.\n\n\n\n# Specification\n\n\n## Aave <> BGD Phase IV (continuous) scope\n\nThe scope of this Phase IV builds upon all previous phases, and as commented, is focused on continuous maintenance and development of the Aave ecosystem technical infrastructure, in combination with security coordination and support to other contributors.\n\nMore specifically, the services include the following:\n\n- **Propose improvements on top of the current Aave v3.2 production version**. This will include minimum a v3.3 and v3.4 versions, but with quite certainty, more.\n    \n    Additionally, we have several other ideas to improve the core protocol, which will be unveiled to the community as soon as the feasibility research is positive.\n    \n- **BGD will take back the scope of deploying to new networks and pool instances**. As commented on our Phase 3 final recap, we identified that having different entities on the deployment stage of Aave v3 creates more overhead than benefit. So we think for Phase IV it is more optimal to get the following entities involved in the activation procedures:\n    - BGD Labs will perform all the pre-governance proposal stages (deployment of required smart contracts, adaptation of all tooling, and development of the activation proposal itself).\n    - As it currently happens, Certora will review the on-chain governance proposal once submitted, in order to have redundancy.\n- **Maintain Aave Governance v3 and a.DI**. In this phase, the effort will be on improving the user interface owned by the Aave DAO, and on the a.DI side, increasing even more the visibility on the infrastructure (on https://adi.onaave.com/), streamlining upgrade procedures via governance proposals, and on-demand, enabling new paths and bridge providers.\n    \n    Additionally, with the rollups ecosystem evolving (e.g. ZK-based), we will once again evaluate the expansion of voting to other networks, an item we removed priority on the previous engagement as the return of resources investment was not there.\n    \n- **Aave bug bounty program**. After already close to 1 year of the Aave <> Immunefi bug bounty being active, we plan to make certain improvements to it. Same time, we will remain as reviewers, addressing all the submissions and the different stages until bounty payment.\n- **v2 further off-boarding**. At the beginning of the previous Phase 3, Aave v2 pools were still very meaningful instances of the protocol, both in size and usage. Currently, different off-boarding initiatives (both from us and other contributors) have reduced a lot the role of v2 in the ecosystem versus v3. During this engagement, we will proceed/support further proposals for off-boarding of v2, with the target being reaching a scenario where only very major assets stay (e.g. WETH, stETH, USDC, USDT), but everything else naturally gets finally migrated to v3.\n- **Focus on Aave Stewards and additional infrastructure delegation**. We believe the path of using what we name the Stewards pattern is most probably the future direction of Aave:\n    - The Aave Protocol (v3) is the base layer of smart contracts, enforcing the highest-order validations and general settlement logic. Decentralized, with only the Aave Governance having “super-admin” control.\n    - The protocol delegates operational/management functions to other smart contracts, the Stewards. These are highly constrained on-chain agents, that allow for faster and more optimal operations, but that can lose this power at any point if the Aave Governance decides so, and with low capacity to create any damage on the protocol.\n    - Currently, the Stewards are focused mainly on optimizing risk parameter updates, but we envision extending this pattern to multiple areas, for example, finance (a Finance Steward is in the advance stage by the treasury contributors).\n    \n    Our role in Stewards development will involve 1) defining an approach that is scalable enough for the current and future needs of the DAO 2) developing the core Steward contracts we believe require our involvement 3) if optimal, supporting other contributors to create their own Stewards, or modifying existing ones for the needs of the DAO.\n    \n- **Umbrella support post-release**. In Phase 3, we included a separate scope for the creation from scratch of Umbrella, a new version of the current Aave Safety Module. Scheduled to be released pretty soon, the project will require post-release support, mainly in the shape of:\n    - Supporting non-BGD contributors involved in all Umbrella operations, for example, regulation of incentives, and risk considerations like choosing correct targets.\n    - Improvements post-release.\n    - Iterating on tooling after the initial effort included with the previous Umbrella scope.\n- **Aave protocol security coordinator**. Same as in our previous engagement, this involves:\n    - Continuously evaluate technical risks for Aave.\n    - Address events involving any vulnerability affecting Aave. This includes also creating governance proposals if required.\n    - Act as technical support for the Aave Protocol and Governance Guardians: define and document plans of action, communicate with both of them whenever a reaction is needed, and also properly disclose to the community activity on Guardian.\n- **Aave proposals reviews**. We will review all governance proposals before they go on-chain, the same as we have been doing last year. This acts as the first layer of security and quality, minimizing any potential issue to be detected on the on-chain stage by Certora, on their line of contribution.\n- **Maintenance and improvement of all tooling of the Aave ecosystem**. During the previous phases, we created multiple tools and projects on the off-chain side of Aave, like Aave Address Book, the Aave Proposals repository, Aave Helpers, the Aave Config Engine and a myriad of others. During this new Phase, we will keep improving them and creating anything new needed.\n- **Analysis for candidate networks to activate Aave v3**. Even if the plan on the previous scope was to off-board network analysis, finally we decided to keep performing them ourselves, as the overhead of supporting another entity would not have been good resource allocation.\n    \n    In this new scope, we will continue performing this analysis.\n    \n\n\n---\n\n**DURATION**: same as with Phases II & III, 6 months: starting from the moment the previous engagement ended (1st October 2024) and lasting until 1st April 2025.\n\n**BUDGET**: 2’300’000 in stablecoins and 5’000 AAVE, 50% paid up-front and 50% streamed during the 6 months engagement.\n\n---\n\n\n## What is NOT part of both the scopes\n\nSimilar as on Phase 3, we want to be explicit on what is not included in our line of contribution:\n\n- We are a technical provider of the community, we don’t do any type of business development and/or growth, that should be responsibility of other parties.\n- We don’t do security reviews on major developments of other contributors. We offer our security advisory for minor projects solely benefiting the Aave DAO, but on bigger scopes (e.g. something like GHO), that is up to parties engaged specifically on security, like Certora. On our side, we only do a best-effort review if we deem it appropriate.\n- We will provide feedback on design of projects that we don’t lead only whenever the project is 1) of technical nature and 2) the final design is flagged as “ready” by the contributor. Given our expertise, we have pretty strong stand in architecture and design decisions, which can create conflicts if no framework is defined.\n- We only work on projects with TEMP CHECK Snapshot passed (e.g. reviews). With the activity on the DAO increasing day by day, unless a filtering of projects is applied, it is not really manageable for us to support any project in pre-TEMP CHECK stage, unless we identified a clear need from our side.\n- We are not running services on behalf of the DAO, we design them to be ran in a decentralised manner, or by parties with the proper role to do so. Any tool we decide to run on our infrastructure (e.g. hosting of one instance of the Aave Governance v3 interface) is our own decision, outside of the scope of engagement.\n- Very ad-hoc projects will depend on the pipeline of priority, and potentially will be budgeted/estimated independently, if we see they will have important implications on the scope that we need to fulfil and/or not fitting in this initial estimation. For example, any projects like Umbrella will be budgeted apart, and we don’t disclose them at the moment, due to being in feasibility research phase.\n\n\n# Terms of Service\n\nA formal Terms and Conditions document for the engagement for services between the Aave DAO and BGD Labs can be found [HERE](https://bgdlabs.com/aave-dao-tos).\n\n\nWe would like however to highlight again the same high-level points as on Phase 3, which we thing are very important for the ethos of the DAO:\n\n- **Major projects IP and licensing belongs to the Aave DAO**. As a service provider to a DAO like Aave, we have an obligation to defend the interests of our customer. For that reason, the core software (e.g. all on-chain smart contracts to be used by the DAO in production) we create during our engagement are licensed to the Aave DAO governance smart contracts. This applies but is not limited for example to new Aave v3 version, Aave Governance v3, a.DI or others; systems that we consider highly innovative and not only improve the efficiency of Aave, but increase the overall value of the technology owned by the DAO.\n    \n    To insist on the previous fundamental implication:\n    \n    - The Aave DAO is the sole owner of the intellectual property and licensing of those projects.\n    - It is entirely up to the DAO to decide how to use and/or commercialise them, not to BGD Labs.\n    - Our benefit from those projects is the fee we receive from the DAO for developing the software.\n    \n    Even if already doing it by commercialising all the different Aave products, we believe in the near future IP and licensing commercialisation is something the DAO should put focus on, at the same time common good infrastructure is released.\n    \n- **BGD doesn’t decide what gets activated/applied in Aave**. We create the software and the technical proposals to activate said software, but it is and will always be up to the DAO governance to decide if that software should be enabled in production.\n- **No software is flawless, but we pursue it**. Historically, no major problem has been detected on the developments we did for the DAO, but it is impossible to assure from our side that all software will be flawless. However, we have a firm compromise of always following solid security standards and procedures, to minimise any potential impact.\n- **We don’t work with competitors of the Aave DAO**. To do the type of work we do on Aave, the community should trust us as service provider. To avoid any type of conflict, we compromise to not work with any competitor of the Aave DAO for any type of financial gain.\n\n\n# Disclosures\n\nBGD Labs has no meaningful commercial relation with entities that could create any type conflict of interest on the scopes of this proposal.\nSimilar as during the previous years, the majority of our focus is on core development and security services on Aave (exclusive provider): we have absolutely no engagement with any entity that could be perceived as competitor of the Aave DAO and we will not during the duration of this Phase 4.\n\n\n# Next steps\n\nIf the outcome of this pre-approval Snapshot ARFC is positive, we will proceed with the final AIP on-chain proposal, which will act as binding agreement for services between the Aave DAO and BGD Labs",

        "body": "# Summary\nPresent to the Aave DAO a proposal for BGD to continue as provider of development services, after Phase 1 and 2.\n\n---\n---\n\n# 1. Motivation. Aave and BGD 1, 2….3\n\nMay 9th 2022, we presented Aave <> BGD Phase 1, a proposal for services to the DAO, covering a pretty extensive scope on the big majority of Aave sub-systems; development and security related.\n\nDuring the following 15 months, we [did or participated in dozens of projects](https://governance.aave.com/t/bgd-working-day-365/13033)  of technical nature for the Aave DAO, and more importantly, we set precedent that a model of a fully independent company providing services to a decentralised entity can work.\n\nSeptember 4th 2023, we presented Aave <> BGD Phase 2, with similar type of scope as Phase 1, but with slightly different objectives in mind: the technical foundation of the Aave DAO was pretty solid from Phase 1, and possible to iterate on top of it, with a more concrete scope.\nAdditionally, we set ourselves as a goal to study how to introduce extra technical parties to service specific needs of the DAO, helping more on the decentralisation of the organisation, but without disturbing operations and delivery.\n\nAlso, we proposed a way shorter engagement (6 months), which we thought was more optimal for the DAO to have capacity to manoeuvre. The outcome of this work can be found [HERE](https://governance.aave.com/t/bgd-aave-bored-ghosts-phase-2-recap/16791).\n\n\n\nWe think that our services to the DAO on both Phases had played a role on Aave staying in top of its category for years in so nascent field, and the Aave codebase being used in other products, accounting to close to 75% of total market share category.\n\nNow we present Phase 3, continuist, but with some important changes in terms of scope.\n\n---\n---\n\n# 2. Specification. Aave <> BGD Phase III. The scope\n\nThis time, we want to explicit divide our proposal in 2 different and explicit components, each one with its separate scope, budget and duration characteristics.\n\n## Scope 1. Aave technical maintenance, improvements, security coordination and tech advisory to the DAO\n\nThis scope is the continuist component historically performed by BGD for the DAO, and will be composed of the following items:\n\n- Maintain, improve and consolidate all the Aave tooling introduced in Phases I & II, including but not limited to Aave Address Book, Aave Helpers, Aave Proposals, Risk Stewards, Seatbelt and Killswitch.\n- Maintain and improve Aave Governance v3, a.DI and Aave Robot, together with the tooling surrounding them.\n    \n    The following new items will be delivered, consequence of the research done on Phase 2:\n    \n    - Extend coverage of voting networks to rollups, apart from the current Polygon PoS and Avalanche C-Chain.\n    - Allow voting with AAVE tokens held in non-Ethereum networks.\n    - Granular and generalised consensus rules for a.DI, together with different planned optimisations.\n- Propose further improvements on top of the upcoming Aave 3.1.\n- Different v3 maintenance tasks with important development requirements, including:\n    - Improve asset off-boarding procedures.\n    - Complete removal of stable debt logic.\n- Act as reviewers of Aave <> Immunefi for all current Aave ecosystem, not including GHO (Avara currently being the reviewer). Additionally, doing proper maintenance of the bug bounty program.\n- Act as security coordinator of the Aave ecosystem, including:\n    - Continuously evaluate potential technical risks for Aave.\n    - Design specific protection strategies in the event of any vulnerability affecting Aave.\n    - If arising, create governance proposals to mitigate any type of problem affecting Aave.\n    - Coordinate with the Aave Guardian for protective emergency actions.\n- Support with further technical off-boarding strategies for legacy versions of Aave (v1, v2) in a safe manner, both for the DAO and the users of the protocol.\n- Advise other contributors on which security procedures to apply for their developments, when required.\n- Evaluate new upcoming high-level technical implications/risks for the protocol, for example, new types of assets being listed.\n- Generally advise other contributors, whenever feedback from an entity expert on the Aave protocol is required. This includes but is not limited to contributors on the risk, treasury, security reviews and miscellaneous fields.\n- Review governance proposals on pre-onchain stage, not as a full security audit, but in order to verify that we don’t see any integration problem with Aave’s smart contracts and good practises.\n\n---\n\n*Scope 1. Aave technical maintenance, improvements, security coordination and tech advisory to the DAO*\n\n**DURATION**: same as with Phase 2, 6 months, starting from proposal execution.\n\n**BUDGET**: as some items are not included in the scope (more later), the budget has been reduced from Phase 2. 1’600’000 in stablecoins and 5’000 AAVE, 60% paid up-front and 40% streamed during the 6 months engagement.\n\n\n## What is NOT part of the scope\n\n- We are a technical provider of the community, we don’t do any type of business development and/or growth, that should be responsibility of other parties.\n- We don’t do security reviews on major developments of other contributors. We offer our security advisory for minor projects solely benefiting the Aave DAO, but on bigger scopes (e.g. something like GHO), that is up to parties engaged specifically on security, like Certora.\n- We will provide feedback on design of projects that we don’t lead only whenever the project is 1) of technical nature and 2) the final design is flagged as “ready” by the contributor.\nGiven our expertise, we have pretty strong stand in architecture and design decisions, which can create conflicts if no framework is defined.\n- We only work on projects with TEMP CHECK Snapshot passed (e.g. reviews). With the activity on the DAO increasing day by day, unless a filtering of projects is applied, it is not really manageable for us to support any project in pre-TEMP CHECK stage, unless we identified a clear need from our side.\n- We are not running services on behalf of the DAO, we design them to be ran in a decentralised manner, or by parties with the proper role to do so.\nAny tool we decide to run on our infrastructure (e.g. hosting of one instance of the Aave Governance v3 interface) is our own decision, outside of the scope of engagement.\n\n---\n---\n\n## Scope 2: Aave Safety Module - Code A\n\nAs commented before, we believe now the Aave DAO is in a really solid stage of their current systems, quite future-proof and ready to scale:\n\n- Aave v3 is a solid liquidity layer, on which is possible to iterate and improve.\n- Aave Governance v3 is probably the most advanced on-chain governance system in production.\n- a.DI is a totally generic bridging layer, that can be used for any cross-chain communication need on the Aave ecosystem, in a secure and scalable manner.\n- Aave Robot is a solid automation layer, integrated with Chainlink Automation, but flexible enough for any technology.\n\nMore in the line of innovative projects like Aave Governance v3, we propose to create a completely new system in an Aave component which requires improvement: the Aave Safety Module.\n\n\n### Aave Safety Module: Code A\n\nSafety Module Code A is the major project on the innovation side of this scope, but different to previous cases, our proposed approach is different: at the moment, we will not disclose a detailed description of it, as we think this is the right strategic approach for the DAO.\n\nHowever, we can say the following about Code A:\n\n- It will change completely the dynamics of the Safety Module and its components, including stkGHO, stkAAVE and stkABPT.\n- More efficient mechanism than the current.\n- Improved use experience.\n- Heavily improved dynamics for builders to build on top, but still batteries included.\n- Affecting importantly AAVE tokenomics.\n- Holistically designed, taking into account Aave v3 and GHO.\n- Directly/indirectly benefiting any future project of the DAO.\n\nWe are aware this requires some trust by the community on our research and execution capabilities (which is reflected on the payment schedule), but considering that the main beneficiary will be explicitly the DAO and our history of services, we think it is acceptable.\n\n---\n\n*Scope 2. Safety Module Code A*\n\n**DURATION**: this scope is not continuous like Scope 1, but our estimation is similar for full completion, approximately during the next 6 months to have everything fully ready and in production.\nHowever, delivery and communications will definitely be iterative, with extensive details of Project A to be disclosed in the first 2 months, and highly probably some of its components.\n\n**BUDGET**: 1’900’000 in stablecoins and 7’500 AAVE, with the following schedule:\n\n- 40% upfront.\n- 60% in a delayed payment in 4-months from now, when we estimate to be in good stage of completion.\n\n---\n---\n\n## Terms of Service\n\n- **Major projects IP and licensing belongs to the Aave DAO**. As a service provider to a DAO like Aave, we have an obligation to defend the interests of our customer. For that reason, the major software we have produced during our engagement have been licensed to the Aave DAO governance smart contracts. This applies but is not limited for example to Aave Governance v3, a.DI or others; systems that we consider highly innovative and not only improve the efficiency of Aave, but increase the overall value of the technology owned by the DAO.\n    \n    To insist on the previous fundamental implication: \n    \n    - The Aave DAO is the sole owner of the intellectual property and licensing of those projects.\n    - It is entirely up to the DAO to decide how to use and/or commercialise them, not to BGD Labs.\n    - Our benefit from those projects is the fee we receive from the DAO for developing the software.\n    \n    Even if other models can be explorer, from our point of view, this is a pretty solid contribution model for the innovation side of the DAO.\n    \n- **BGD doesn’t decide what gets activated/applied in Aave**. We create the software and the technical proposals to activate said software, but it is and will always be up to the DAO governance to decide if that software should be enabled in production.\n- **No software is flawless, but we pursue it**. Historically, no major problem has been detected on the developments we did for the DAO, but it is impossible to assure from our side that all software will be flawless. However, we have a firm compromise of always following solid security standards and procedures, to minimise any potential impact.\n\n---\n\n# 3. Next steps\n\nIf this ARFC Snapshot is positive, we will proceed with an on-chain governance proposal that will serve as formal and binding agreement for services between the Aave DAO and BGD Labs, on the terms defined.",

        "body": "---\nTitle: [TEMP CHECK] Further Aave v1 deprecation strategy\n\nAuthor: BGD Labs @bgdlabs\n\nDate: 2024-01-09\n\n---\n\n## Summary\nApprove further steps of Aave v1 off-boarding, to reduce operational overhead on deprecated Aave instances.\n\n\n## Motivation\nThe Aave protocol v1 was released in January 2020 and eventually superseded by Aave protocol v2 in December on the same year.\n\nWhile Aave v1 has been deprecated for a long time, some liquidity is still stuck on the protocol 1. Even if this instance is not covered by the Aave Safety Module, being part of Aave, it still is monitored and evaluated whenever development and/or security decisions are made.\n\nThis creates meaningful overhead for all involved development & security teams, which directly adds cost to the Aave DAO. Additionally, the architecture of Aave v1 is quite different to Aave v2 & v3, making it the most ad-hoc instance of Aave.\n\nFor the previous reasons, we think the community should evaluate approving extra off-boarding steps.\n\n\n## Specification\nTo achieve a complete off-boarding of Aave v1, the following needs to be completed:\n\n- All debt has to be settled, in order to allow liquidity providers on v1 to withdraw.\n- All assets have to be withdrawn.\n\nTo minimise the impact on users we propose a phased approach, where each phase could last in the order of 1-3 weeks.\n\n### Phase 1\nIn a first phase we recommend to upgrade the liquidation mechanism on the protocol in the following ways:\n\n- It should no longer be possible to receive aTokens for liquidations (as the goal is to remove liquidity, not transfer it from user to user).\n- It should be possible to liquidate healthy (collateralised) positions with a fixed liquidationBonus (e.g. 1%). This value should be small to not hurt borrowers, while still being big enough to incentivise liquidations. If this Temp Check is successful, we will confirm the number with risk providers., but 1% at the current moment would make the liquidation profitable for approximately 85% of the positions to liquidate.\n- It should be possible to liquidate a entire position at once (currently on Aave v1 only 50% of a position can be liquidated).\n- Interest rates should be lowered to the minimum, as the previously described always-enabled dynamics remove any need of utilisation dynamics.\n- Remove flash loan fee, as there should not be extra incentives for liquidity providers.\n\n### Phase 2\nIn a second phase we recommend increasing the fixed liquidationBonus to a higher percentage.\n\nThe exact number must be chosen based on current market conditions to minimise user impact, but allow economical liquidations.\n\n### Phase 3\nOnce the big majority of debt is repaid, we recommend to introduce a forced withdrawal mechanism. With forced withdrawals anybody could withdraw on behalf of any liquidity provider on Aave v1, with the funds received by the holder of the aToken.\n\nIt is important to clarify that further technical aspects on this should be analysed before executing this step, for example smart contracts receiving funds without triggering a withdrawal.\n\n---\n\nAfter all the Phases are finished, additional ad-hoc steps can be executed, like Rescue Mission for locked funds.\n\n\n## Next Steps\n\nIf this TEMP CHECK is approved, we will proceed with an ARFC, with the final steps including feedback from risk service providers, and precise technical decisions.\n\nFinally, AIPs will be created for the different phases.\n\n\n## Copyright\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0 .",

        "body": "&nbsp;\n\n## Simple summary\n\nProposal for the activation of Aave v3.1 as an upgrade on top of all active Aave v3 instances.\n\nThe codebase can be found on https://github.com/aave-dao/aave-v3-origin\n\n&nbsp;\n\n## Motivation\n\nAave v3 is a “living” DeFi protocol, which akin to any other software, receives upgrades over time on its different components. Sometimes, the improvements can be made in isolation in independent upgrades, for example, almost 1 year ago, we introduced a new 3.0.2 version 1, including only relatively minor changes and bug fixes.\n\nHowever, since 3.0.2, we had multiple other ideas on the backlog heavily focused on security and optimisation, that over time got validated due to security incidents on similar protocols and by observing operational overhead for Aave contributors (e.g. governance proposals changing parameters). As some of this features in some cases were dependent between each other, end of 2023 we decided to batch them together in a new major-minor Aave v3 version we propose for activation here: **Aave v3.1**.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n## Specification\n\n### 3.1 scope\n\nv3.1 is clearly focused in 2 fields: redundant security and optimisation of the logic to reduce operational overhead.\nWith those principles in mind, the following is a summarised of the features/improvements included in the release (for extensive information, full specification can be found [HERE](https://governance.aave.com/t/bgd-aave-v3-1-and-aave-origin/17305#features-4)):\n\n1. Virtual accounting\n2. Stateful interest rate strategy\n3. Freezing by EMERGENCY_GUARDIAN on PoolConfigurator\n4. Reserve data update on rate strategy and RF (Reserve Factor) changes\n5. Minimum decimals for listed assets\n6. Liquidations grace sentinel\n7. LTV0 on freezing\n8. Permission-less movement of stable positions to variable\n9. Allow setting debt ceiling whenever LT is 0\n10. New getters on Pool and PoolConfigurator for library addresses\n11. Misc minor bug fixes and sync the codebase with the current v3 production\n\n&nbsp;\n\n### Security\n\nThis 3.1 has undergone 3 different procedures, and optionally more are expected pre and post release:\n\n- Security review by [MixBytes](https://mixbytes.io/).\n- Security review by [Certora](https://www.certora.com/), in addition to improved Certora properties since the v3 release.\n- Security review of the most critical feature (Virtual Accounting) by [StErMi](https://twitter.com/stermi).\n\nAll the reports will be added to the Aave v3.1. repository once finished.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe previous third-party procedures complement all the internal by BGD, that we apply to every codebase:\n\n- Testing of all the new features, and verifying/adapting that only intended consequences appear on previous Aave v3 features.\n- Gas implications.\n- Carefully verifying codebase and storage diffs to avoid any type of broken behaviour.\n- High-level operational implications, for example on procedures followed by other Aave contributors when doing governance proposals.\n\nAdditionally, the current Aave Immunefi bug bounty will be applicable to v3.1, once approved via governance and activated on production instances.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n### Upgrade procedure\n\nThe upgrade of v3 instances to v3.1 will be done same as any other Aave on-chain governance proposal: on each applicable network, an executable payload will do the appropriate implementations' upgrades together with any other intended setup.\n\nThe goal is to apply v3.1 on all active Aave v3 networks: Ethereum, Polygon PoS, Avalanche C-Chain, Arbitrum, Optimism, Base, Metis, Scroll, Gnosis and BNBChain.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n### Licensing\nAave v3.1 follows the same licensing approach as all other major contributions of BGD Labs as service provider of the Aave DAO: BUSL 1.1 licensed to the Aave governance smart contracts, explicitly forbidden the usage of the improved codebase in production by any entity competing with Aave.\n\nThe Aave DAO has full power to change this license however deemed appropriate in the future.\n\nThe full license can be found [HERE](https://github.com/aave-dao/aave-v3-origin/blob/main/LICENSE)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n## Next steps\n- Pre-approval via this ARFC Snapshot for the upgrade of all Aave v3 instances to Aave v3.1.\n- In parallel, finish the preparations of the AIP payload for the upgrade, and any extra security procedure around it.",
