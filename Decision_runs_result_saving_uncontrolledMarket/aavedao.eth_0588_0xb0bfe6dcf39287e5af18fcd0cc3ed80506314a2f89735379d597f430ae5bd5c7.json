Both Llama & ACI will propose AIPs on onboard assets on V3…\n\n# Motivation\nSupporting stablecoin diversity is part of the Aave-Chan Initiative (ACI) delegate platform.\n\nThe ACI does not have any link nor is paid by Liquity or any entity to present this ARC.\n\nThe risk parameters provided within are the same as those provided by Gauntlet within the initial forum post 1 discussing which assets to onboard to v3 Ethereum.\n\nThe Interest rate Strategy curve is the same than for LUSD in V2. for now the ACI is supportive to onboard LUSD as it was on V2, when the V3 will be more mature, the ACI is supportive to work on AIP to allow usage of LUSD as a collateral.\n\nBy presenting each asset to be onboarded to v3 Ethereum individually, the community can focus on a specific asset, with individual Snapshots determining how to proceed. Finally, approved assets listings can be grouped for the on-chain AIP vote.\n\n# Specification\nTicker: LUSD\n\nContract Address: https://etherscan.io/address/0x5f98805a4e8be255a32880fdec7f6728c6568ba0#code\n\nRisk Parameter\tValue\nIsolation Mode\tNO\nEnable Borrow\tYES\nEnable Collateral\tNO\nLoan To Value\tN/A\nLiquidation Threshold\tN/A\nLiquidation Bonus\tN/A\nReserve Factor\t10%\nLiquidation Protocol Fee\tN/A\nBorrow Cap\t1,210k\nSupply Cap\t3,000k\nDebt Ceiling\tN/A\nBase\t0%\nSlope1\t4%\nUoptimal\t80%\nSlope2\t87%\n# Copyright\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.",

        "body": "## Summary:\nThis ARFC proposes a direct to AIP vote for cap changes or FreezeReserve() implementation if the following conditions are met:\n\nThe proposal is provided by a risk service provider or has received feedback from at least one risk service provider team.\nThe proposed cap change is not greater than a 100% increase of the current cap or the implementation of a cap.\nThe cap is being decreased.\nThe AIP is implementing a FreezeReserve().\nFor other situations, the normal governance process is applicable.\n\nThis framework is intended for All V3 liquidity pools. Relative to freezing reserves, this framework is intended for all Aave pools.\n\n## Motivation:\nSupply and borrow caps are important safety features of Aave V3, and they are essential for maintaining the stability of the platform. However, these caps can also have a significant impact on the growth potential of the platform. If a cap ceiling is met and governance takes too much time to adapt, this can slow down the growth of the platform and limit its ability to meet the needs of its users.\n\nGiven the importance of supply and borrow caps, it is essential to have a governance process in place that can quickly and efficiently adapt to changing market conditions. A long-term viable solution would be a clear framework and the election via governance of a Risk Council having a degree of Risk management capability over the Aave protocol. However, while the definition and implementation of this is technically allowed by the Aave codebase, it is still immature.\n\nAs a temporary buffer, this ARFC proposes a direct to AIP vote for cap changes or FreezeReserve() implementation under certain conditions to increase the efficiency of the governance process. By streamlining the governance process in this way, we can ensure that the platform can quickly and efficiently adapt to changing market conditions and meet the needs of its users.\n\n## Specification:\nAs there’s no need for on-chain AIP or technical implementation for this ARFC, the outcome of a snapshot vote will be considered canon.\n\n## Disclaimer:\nThe author of this ARFC, Marc Zeller, is the founder of the Aave Chan Initiative and owns AAVE tokens. However, the ACI is not paid by the Aave Companies nor any other entity to submit this ARFC.\n\n## Copyright:\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.",

However, TVL and daily revenue are gradually declining. \n\nThis proposal intends to adjust the v2 wETH interest rate curve to match the v3 wETH interest rate curve which is expected to lead to high utilization of the v2 wETH reserve and partially offset the emerging declining week on week revenue trend.\n\n# Motivation\n\nSince AIP 131 was implemented, the amount of stETH deposited as collateral to borrow wETH has been fairly consistent. However, the amount of wETH borrowed by users who deposited stETH as collateral has reduced from 515.21K to 413.74K between 18th December 2022 and 15th January 2023 (pre Aave v3 launch). The tapering of borrowing demand is reflected in Aave’s wETH nominated revenue figures as shown below.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/YQpHY0c.png)\n\nThe market is indicating that there is insufficient demand for borrowing wETH. Three possible reasons are shown below:\n\n* Structured products charge a fee\n* Additional smart contract risk\n* Elevated exposure to DEX liquidity\n\nOur analysis indicates the Slope1, 5.75%, is most likely the primary causes of the reduced wETH demand. Lowering the Slope1 parameter will enable users to achieve a higher return from entering the recursive loop strategy. The chart below shows how users that deposit stETH and borrow wETH have behaved to date. The date highlighted below is the date AIP131 was executed.\n\n\n\nThis proposal intends to reduce the Slope1 parameters on the v2 market to 3.8% and introduce a Base of 1%. The borrowing rate at the Upotimal point is reduced from 5.75% to 4.8% (Base + Slope1). Introducing a Base, with a Lower Slope1 (4.8% < 5.75%) parameter, acts to reduce the gradient between 0% < Utilization < Uoptimal compared to having a Slope1 = Base + Lower Slope1. \n\nThe graphic below shows the current and proposed wETH interest rate curves.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/72v0mJr.png)\n\nThe graphic below shows the proposed interest rate with Base, Slope1 and Slope2 parameters detailed.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/BKd9DUk.png)\n\nIt is worth noting that borrowing wETH becomes slightly more expensive at lower utilization compared to the current wETH interest rate. When utilization is less than 41% borrowing costs are higher, ranging 0 to 0.98%, and when utilization is greater than 41% borrowing costs are lower, ranging 0 to 0.95%. Current utilization is 46% on the v2 deployment which means the borrowing costs would be reduced.\n\nThe chart below shows the relative change in borrowing costs for users, comparing the current versus the proposed interest rate curve.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/6XyC2Hn.png)\n\n# Specification\n\nThe below table shows the current and proposed wETH interest rate curve for the Ethereum v2 and v3 deployment.\n\n|Parameter|Current (%)|Proposed (%)|\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|Uoptimal|80.00|80.00|\n|Base|0.00|1.00|\n|Slope1|5.75|3.80|\n|Slope2|80.00|80.00|\n|Reserve Factor|15.00|15.00|\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

Both Llama & ACI will propose AIPs on onboard assets on V3\n\nUSDT is currently one of the largest V2 stablecoin reserve with ~335m$ supplied\n\nMotivation\nSupporting stablecoin diversity is part of the Aave-Chan Initiative (ACI) delegate platform.\n\nThe ACI does not have any link nor is paid by Tether or any entity to present this ARC.\n\nThe risk parameters provided introduce USDT as a non-collateral asset.\n\nThe Interest rate Strategy curve is the same as for USDT in V2. for now.\nThe ACI is supportive of onboarding USDT as it was in V2.\nFor now, the ACI doesn’t consider V3 mature enough to activate a USD stablecoins emode and consider USDT in it.\nAlso, supply and borrow caps are suggested for this asset to limit risk exposure.\nThey’re currently set to allow reserve utilization to cross the Uoptimal point slightly. But @ChaosLabs & @Pauljlei input is valuable on this.\n\nBy presenting each asset to be onboarded to v3 Ethereum individually, the community can focus on a specific asset, with individual Snapshots determining how to proceed. Finally, approved assets listings can be grouped for the on-chain AIP vote.\n\nSpecification\nTicker: USDT\n\nContract Address: 0xdAC17F958D2ee523a2206206994597C13D831ec7\n\nRisk Parameter\tValue\nIsolation Mode\tNO\nEnable Borrow\tYES\nEnable Collateral\tNO\nLoan To Value\tN/A\nLiquidation Threshold\tN/A\nLiquidation Bonus\tN/A\nReserve Factor\t10%\nLiquidation Protocol Fee\t0.1\nBorrow Cap\t185M\nSupply Cap\t200M\nDebt Ceiling\tN/A\nBase\t0%\nSlope1\t4%\nUoptimal\t90%\nSlope2\t72%\nAdditional note:\nUSDT has been excluded from collateral assets since DeFi inception due to its centralized nature. After years of functioning as intended and witnessing the growth of USDC in the DeFi ecosystem, it seems that reasons for exclusion have fewer grounds in the current DeFi ecosystem and pragmatic approach would be to onboard it in a conservative way and make risk parameters evolve based on market data.\nWhile this ARC doesn’t present a proposal to add USDT as collateral, the ACI thinks the community should consider this as something to discuss at a later stage when V3 will have more maturity.\n\nCopyright\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.",

MKR token holders govern the Maker Protocol, the smart contracts that power DAI. There is currently $12.71m of MKR deposited into Aave v2 on Ethereum. This proposal grants Aave the opportunity to list the governance token of the community supporting DAI which contributes $167m of TVL on the Ethereum v2 deployment.\n\nThis ARFC is a joint effort with ACI and 3SE to allow a selection of v2 listed assets to be onboarded on V3 via the governance process. Subject to a favourable Snapshot vote, Llama will submit an AIP for voting.\n\n# Motivation\n\nMaker DAO has over $7.45B in TVL and is ranked second on Defi Llama TVL rankings. The Maker Protocol is only deployed on the Ethereum network. The stable coin DAI, provides $167m of deposits into Aave v2 on Ethereum, with over $103m of this supply being borrowed by users.\n\nThe risk parameters provided here within are from Gauntlet’s original Aave v3 initial [assets listings and configurations](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-aave-v3-ethereum-deployment-assets-and-configurations/10238/22) forum thread. These parameters are to be revised by Gauntlet and feedback will be incorporated before progressing to a Snapshot vote.\n\nThe interest rate provided in the proposal mirrors the v2 deployment with exception of the parameters specific to stable interest rates. The stable rates proposed are the somewhat generic listing rates as stable borrowing is disabled. However, if stable borrowing was enabled, the suggested parameters are suitable and don’t create any undesirable dynamics between stable and variable rates.\n\nWe note that this proposal is to be reviewed by Gauntlet, with feedback incorporated, prior to progressing to Snapshot.\n\n# Specification\n\nTicker: MKR\n\nContract Address: [0xba100000625a3754423978a60c9317c58a424e3D](https://etherscan.io/address/0x9f8F72aA9304c8B593d555F12eF6589cC3A579A2)\n\n|Risk Parameter|Value|\n| --- | --- |\n|Isolation Mode|YES|\n|Enable Borrow|YES|\n|Enable Collateral|YES|\n|Loan To Value|65.00%|\n|Liquidation Threshold|70.00%|\n|Liquidation Bonus|8.50%|\n|Reserve Factor|20.00%|\n|Liquidation Protocol Fee|10.00%|\n|Borrow Cap|1,500|\n|Supply Cap|6,000|\n|Debt Ceiling|$2,500,000|\n|Variable Base|0.00%|\n|Variable Slope1|7.00%|\n|Variable Slope2|300.00%|\n|Uoptimal|45%|\n|Stable Borrowing|Disabled|\n|Stable Slope1|13.00%|\n|Stable Slope2|300.00%|\n|Base Stable Rate Offset|3.00%|\n|Stable Rate Excess Offset|5.00%|\n|Optimal Stable To Total Debt Ratio|20.00%|\n\nNote: Stable borrowing is disabled, however parameters are provided in case stable borrowing is enabled at a later date without amending any parameters.\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",
