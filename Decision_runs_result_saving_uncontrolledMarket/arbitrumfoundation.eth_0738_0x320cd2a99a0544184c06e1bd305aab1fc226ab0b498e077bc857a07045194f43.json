        "body": "# Non-Constitutional\n\n# Abstract\n\nThis proposal builds on the ideas and concepts introduced by [@dk3](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/dk3) in the initial [Operation Company (OpCo) proposal](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/the-opco-scale-structure-synergy/22737). The OpCo is a legal entity that delegates and key stakeholders can leverage to achieve DAO-defined goals, principally by forming an operational mesh layer and assigning internal employees or negotiating and entering into agreements with service providers and individual contributors to facilitate initiatives. OpCo’s mission is to negate identified frictions affecting the DAO’s strategy execution, such as allowing for the establishment of more operational roles for the DAO, facilitating efficient and competitive contributor and service provider negotiations and information flow between these parties, creating clear responsibilities for carrying out initiatives, and helping ensure the continuation of programs the DAO depends upon. OpCo is also required to be proactive, meaning that if the entity has the bandwidth and recognizes a potential advancement that could be made within its mandated focus areas, it can work on and propose a strategy through which the entity would address the identified frictions.\n\nAs it currently stands, the Arbitrum DAO is generally unable to move swiftly when it requires specialized contributors to execute a strategy, for which there isn’t a straightforward and low-friction approach, with these processes typically requiring a vast amount of effort from the supply side instead of being driven by the demand side. Moreover, many initiatives, especially more complex and wider-reaching ones, lack clear owners in charge of ensuring a holistic approach to execution and initiatives’ continuation, meaning that in the unfortunate case that a service provider decides/is forced to disengage from its duties, there aren’t always accountable individuals or entities that would push the initiatives forward. OpCo’s goal is to function as the entity the DAO can leverage to remedy these limitations and move forward in areas that require a more structured approach.\n\nTo cover OpCo’s operating expenses over the first 30 months, including full-time staff appointed internally, setup and other admin costs, as well as the DAO-adjacent entity’s oversight committee, this proposal suggests earmarking 22M ARB (subject to change in either direction if market conditions change notably between the Snapshot and Tally votes) for the initiative:\n\n* 4M ARB allocated to a bonus pool for internal employees and OpCo’s oversight committee (3M reserved for internal employees and 1M reserved for the committee). If bonuses are paid out, they must be denominated in ARB and have a vesting structure attached, with internal employees’ payouts additionally being performance-based.\n* Of the remaining 18M ARB, tokens will be liquidated until $12M worth of cash equivalents has been attained. At ARB’s current price of $1, this would require roughly 12M ARB. The liquidation will occur over up to 3 months immediately following the proposal passing Tally at the discretion of the liquidating party (the Arbitrum Foundation together with a provider of their choice for asset liquidation) with a mandate to minimize price impact.\n* After subtracting the bonus allocation and the liquidation is complete, the remaining ARB of the earmarked 22M token allocation will be immediately transferred back to the DAO treasury.\n\n![ARB Liquidation.png](ipfs://bafybeifs75ocgefcebce7mgv5spdjfubengcta7ua6nz5rbrlbprbbtxvq)\n\nOpCo will be able to utilize the $12M in cash equivalents as follows:\n\n* $2.5M worth of stable assets released upfront.\n* Once OpCo has officially operationalized, the entity can draw up to $500K of cash equivalents each month.\n* If a monthly drawdown exceeds $500K but is below $1.5M, the executive-equivalent employees must get approval from the OAT before accessing the funds.\n* If a monthly drawdown exceeds $1.5M, OpCo must seek approval from the DAO through a Snapshot vote.\n\n# Motivation\n\nPresently, most DAO programs operate in silos, leading to, among other things, redundant efforts and non-existing cross-initiative resources. The DAO also generally depends on a single initiative leader for the continuation of a successful program, while some initiatives don’t even have clear owners, which adds significant friction to strategy execution. DAOs are also inherently disadvantaged when evaluating and swiftly engaging individual contributors or service providers, and Arbitrum is no exception. This proposal aims to provide the DAO with the capabilities to nullify the abovementioned frictions by creating a DAO-adjacent legal entity—OpCo. Among other things, the DAO may choose to leverage OpCo to manage:\n\n* Operational support & project planning,\n* Project management of DAO initiatives,\n* Negotiations with service providers,\n* Allocation of resources across contributors & DAO-approved projects\n\nOpCo will grant the Arbitrum DAO better capabilities to bootstrap initiatives and secure the continuation and execution of them, while also expanding the total addressable contributor and service provider base as certain sensitive negotiations and deal terms don’t necessarily have to be disclosed publicly. Moreover, the DAO-adjacent entity will function as the operational mesh layer for individual contributors and service providers, streamlining communications and knowledge sharing across engaged entities and individuals.\n\nOverall, the DAO’s past, current, and likely upcoming initiatives can be divided into 5 high-level categories: Governance Frameworks, Financial Management, Investments, Ecosystem Support, and Grants. The initiatives, their respective owners, and into which of the 5 categories they fall are visualized below.\n\n![Current Initiatives.png](ipfs://bafybeidaponefn7ospa42xhhtdhcw2v33to5yvrskyrvcxbmtagwwl24ru)\n\nIt is of utmost importance that Arbitrum DAO maintains a decentralized and bottoms-up system for bootstrapping new projects, DAO contributors, and setting strategies, including creating and steering the DAO’s vision, mission, and purpose, as well as approaches to achieve the goals and decision-making. As such, OpCo will be focused on the Ecosystem Support and Financial Management initiative categories, but note that with the exception of the Investments category and any emerging future categories wherein other, new DAO-adjacent legal entities are set to operate, the mandate can be expanded into any current/future initiative category if the DAO so chooses through a Snapshot vote (simple majority with at least 3% of all votable tokens voting either “For” or “Abstain”).\n\nThe entity’s main focus is to increase the efficiency of strategy execution through operational optimization and, in particular, activating and recruiting the optimal stakeholders, contributors, and service providers. For the avoidance of doubt, the DAO would always have ultimate authority over OpCo, with the entity purely being a helpful resource focused on streamlining wider-reaching and complex initiatives that require a more structured execution framework as well as helping push the DAO forward within areas where the entity identifies shortcomings. We want to stress the importance of ensuring that one of Arbitrum DAO’s key differentiators—enabling new participants to join the ecosystem and make an impact, growing into well-established contributors—is conserved. Without Arbitrum DAO empowering its contributors and delegates, the DAO might sacrifice one of its core strengths, and we believe that entities such as SEEDGov, Entropy Advisors, Tally, etc., are present within the ecosystem exactly because of this empowerment.\n\nArbitrum has one of the most active and engaged DAOs within the industry, combined with help from the Arbitrum Foundation and robust programs for bootstrapping and fostering growth within the ecosystem. Although there is always room for improvement, these factors have enabled the DAO to allocate grants with positive results, sustaining a vibrant and welcoming ecosystem. Having said that, if the DAO wishes to, it can expand OpCo’s mandate to include grants in the future through a Snapshot vote. When it comes to investments from treasury funds, the GCP has been established to facilitate capital allocation into the gaming sector, while the AVI is currently working on setting up a structure allowing the DAO to make venture bets across other verticals, which is why OpCo will be excluded from operating within the investments category. As alluded to earlier, we also feel as though it’s crucial that the facilitation and implementation of governance frameworks continue being driven by decentralized actors, but the DAO could again expand OpCo’s operations into this initiative category if it so wishes.\n\nWith that said, certain clear inefficiencies have been identified with respect to the Financial Management and Ecosystem Support categories. This is likely due to the operational frameworks enabling execution for these categories still being somewhat underexplored areas. As such, there is a lack of ownership, and the DAO has no structured way to frictionlessly operationalize contributors to push complex challenges forward within these verticals, often requiring a vast amount of Arbitrum DAO-specific knowledge and even lobbying efforts from the supply side instead of the demand side. Due to the current structure, active governance participants are generally purely incentivized to prioritize strategies that they are fit to solve. This has left certain critical domains unattended and reflects the need for an entity that could be mandated to help define the root causes of execution obstacles and provide solutions to remedy them.\n\nThe aforementioned inefficiencies are naturally amplified by the fact that the number of potential contributors is often restricted due to many initiatives requiring deep specialization. Finding the facilitators capable of managing initiatives end-to-end within these categories can be difficult. Oftentimes, the contributor and owner roles for initiatives are separated or there is not a clear owner at all, meaning that no one party is responsible for the continuation of these initiatives. For initiatives where the contributor and owner roles are the same or there is a clearly defined owner, the DAO generally relies on a single party for the continuation of the initiative. If the service provider or contributor, for any reason, decides or is forced to exit the ecosystem, there is not a well-defined framework for the initiative to be moved to a new owner.\n\nAs initiated, OpCo’s core mandate will be to enable the execution of DAO-defined strategies within the Financial Management and Ecosystem Support categories when requested by delegates. However, OpCo is also required to be proactive, meaning that if the entity has the bandwidth and recognizes an area within its focus categories where developments could be made, it can propose a strategy through which the entity would address the identified frictions.\n\nTypically, the current protocol for the execution of strategies and new initiatives within the DAO’s two aforementioned focus areas is as follows: (i) either the proposer defines the strategic approach and goals for the initiative or a working group is created that aims to outline these specifics such that a proposal can be created, with the working group also sometimes facilitating some or all of the work required for the execution of the strategy; (ii) if not done by the working group, the proposer or proposer-connected party is contracted to facilitate the strategy or the DAO runs some type of a procurement/election process to decide the service providers or contributors; (iii) once the work has been performed and the facilitators’ term ends, a continuation proposal is created if the initiative has a clear owner. Otherwise, individual DAO contributors are required to take charge of the initiative and push it forward.\n\nIf OpCo were to be created, it would primarily be leveraged to assume responsibility for phases (ii) and (iii). I.e., the DAO defines strategies or simply strategic goals. If a clear executor to reach the key objectives exists within the DAO, they could be chosen as a facilitator and would be contracted by the OpCo. If not, OpCo could be mandated to execute these strategies by either assigning existing internal employees, hiring new internal resources, or contracting outside service providers/individual contributors to perform the required undertakings. However, if the DAO isn’t proactively defining strategies/strategic goals, OpCo is required to be active within this area as well, given it has the bandwidth to do so, with these OpCo-created strategies then ratified by the DAO through the regular voting process.\n\nOpCo would have full discretion over hiring internal employees, while anyone interested in facilitating a DAO initiative could propose themselves (or another party) for that. Such a proposal must include a capital allocation to cover the facilitator’s expenses since OpCo’s budget only covers internal employees’ salaries. If approved through governance, the facilitator would then be contracted by OpCo as a service provider for the DAO. Depending on what is viewed as the most efficient approach, OpCo will have the ability to negotiate and run procurement processes both privately and publicly, which will further strengthen the Arbitrum DAO’s ability to attract and retain top talent, with all information that can be shared with the wider DAO being made available through oversight and financial reports. The below slide depicts OpCo’s initial focus categories, but please note that with the exception of the Investments category and any emerging future categories wherein other, new DAO-adjacent legal entities are set to operate, the mandate can be expanded into any current/future initiative category.\n\n![Future Structure.png](ipfs://bafybeiewjs6bgbqbbnrswbtdxkd2f2wr6b2ymjatwwu26ojtufsxfy3u5m)\n\nIf a DAO-ratified strategy or strategic goal that the OpCo is mandated to facilitate doesn’t have a specific end date, the DAO-adjacent entity would continue executing until the entity feels as though the associated goals have been reached or the DAO instructs the entity to stop executing by passing a Snapshot vote (simple majority with at least 3% of all votable tokens voting either “For” or “Abstain”). If the work is expected to be long-term in nature, OpCo would be responsible for ensuring that it can be continued by accounting for associated costs in its budget extension request.\n\nFor example, delegates could define a high-level events strategy by deciding the number of events the Arbitrum DAO should be represented at in 2025, whether the strategy facilitator is the proposer, a proposer-related party, an OpCo internal employee, or someone who is chosen through a procurement process, and approving the strategy’s costs that are not covered by OpCo’s budget (i.e., salaries if the facilitators are not full-time staff appointed internally, booking event venues, catering, etc.) through the typical governance process, after which OpCo plans the exact events to participate in, contracts the required service providers or operationalizes internal employees, and manages all involved stakeholders and other related aspects throughout the process.\n\nService providers and individual contributors that are currently contracted, or will likely be in the near future, with the Arbitrum Foundation and fall within the Financial Management and Ecosystem Support categories, such as SEEDGov in its role as the Delegate Incentive Program Manager, MSS members, firms forming the ADPC, Entropy Advisors, etc., should collaborate closely with OpCo once its operations are fully established and stabilized. Once fully operational, OpCo will have the capacity to project manage and oversee these initiatives according to its complete mandate. The long-term vision for this process is as follows:\n\n1. OpCo’s core team is hired, and operations begin;\n2. OpCo demonstrates product-market fit (i.e., the DAO is satisfied with the entity’s output) and that it has adequate processes, capabilities, and any other relevant functions to execute according to its complete mandate;\n3. OpCo is prepared to oversee full-time DAO operations, assuming existing contributor contracts through novation and managing new initiatives on behalf of the DAO (e.g., by ensuring that appropriate KYC measures and documentation are implemented).\n\nIn the case that an integral facilitator within the Ecosystem Support or Financial Management categories (or any other category OpCo might be mandated to operate within in the future) exits the ecosystem for any reason and an initiative is left without an owner, the DAO could likewise mandate OpCo to find a replacement solution.\n\nIt’s important to note that OpCo will not have the authority to enter into contracts with service providers or individual contributors for strategies not approved by the DAO through governance, unless directly related to its operational needs (e.g., hiring an accounting firm). OpCo internal full-time employees cannot be contributors to DAO initiatives as individuals (they need to do so through OpCo) and are strictly prohibited from entering into employment engagements with other DAOs, organizations, entities, or comparable affiliations, whilst contractors that facilitate a specific vertical and are signed to OpCo can have engagements in other DAO initiatives and outside of the ecosystem. Full-time OpCo staff can only be appointed internally. However, as mentioned earlier, the DAO can roll any service provider or individual contributor into OpCo by passing an onchain vote. This vote has to request capital to cover the facilitators’ expenses since when it comes to salaries, OpCo’s budget only covers internal full-time staff. OpCo is expected to work closely with Offchain Labs as well as the Arbitrum Foundation to ensure that scopes of work do not overlap.\n\nIndividual contributors, service providers, and other analogous entities are naturally free to go directly to the DAO to propose they facilitate a workstream and get paid for it without facilitation by the OpCo. However, if the proposed scope of work falls within OpCo’s mandate, it is expected that delegates vote against such a proposal if it can be better executed via OpCo’s involvement. Proposers will be encouraged to engage with OpCo before posting a proposal to the forum to align with the DAO-adjacent entity’s internal employees. OpCo’s internal employees will also proactively communicate with proposal authors and facilitators outside of OpCo such that there is no overlap between deliverables and the future plans for all initiatives are clear.\n\nFinally, it’s crucial to mention that the introduction of a DAO-adjacent legal entity carries risks and burdens that shouldn’t be ignored. Among other things, it requires some trust in a select group of facilitators as they are responsible for hiring and procuring the correct contributors as well as operationalizing and managing the DAO-adjacent entity, OpCo’s setup and fixed costs are quite notable, and some amount of administrative work is required that otherwise wouldn’t have arisen.\n\n# Specifications\n\n## OpCo Operational Process\n\nWe expect the general workflow for OpCo to be as follows:\n\n* A forum discussion is initiated, with the owner of that discussion having communicated with OpCo and defined whether the covered subject falls within OpCo’s initial mandate, i.e., the Financial Management or Ecosystem Support verticals.\n* For verticals that are included in OpCo’s mandate, a discussion could broadly take one of the following forms:\n  * A new key objective is introduced, but the roadmap to achieve that objective is unclear: Delegates have the option to create a Snapshot proposal to direct OpCo to produce an onchain proposal that defines the strategy to achieve the key objective(s), whether the entity would procure a facilitator or hire/operationalize an internal employee, as well as any funds needed to cover the strategy’s expenses, excluding OpCo’s internal employee costs. If approved, OpCo would begin facilitating the proposal created by itself. It’s important to note that OpCo, together with its oversight committee (OAT), is responsible for keeping the DAO informed about the entity’s bandwidth. They’ll also provide updates on when current projects are expected to end. This ensures that if there is a sudden spike in new proposals, especially complex and more time-intensive ones, delegates can prioritize and vote on the ones OpCo can take on.\n    * Example: The DAO wants to run an incentive program to expand the ecosystem, but the incentive program’s structure and size are unclear. A proposal is passed for OpCo to operationalize internal employees and create the exact strategy. OpCo then defines, e.g., the amount of incentives to be distributed, what the application process to receive incentives looks like, how success will be measured, etc. A proposal to ratify the strategy, the incentives to be distributed, and the required workforce is then created. If passed, OpCo will activate the needed facilitators (program manager, data team, etc.) and strategy execution begins.\n  * A new key objective is introduced and the roadmap to achieve that objective is clear: Delegates approve an onchain proposal that defines the strategy, whether the facilitator is the proposer, proposer-related party, an internal OpCo employee, or someone the OpCo procures, and the related expenses excluding facilitator fees for internal OpCo employees, after which strategy execution begins. If a proposal introduces a new key objective with a clear roadmap but that roadmap is ambitious, the OAT together with OpCo should signal how feasible it is for the entity to execute the proposal. If it’s determined that such a roadmap is feasible, the OAT together with OpCo would also communicate whether or not the entity needs more internal resources to be able to execute.\n    * Example: The DAO wants to run an incentive program to expand the ecosystem, and the structure and size are clear. An onchain proposal to ratify the strategy, the facilitators, and the capital needed is then created. If passed, the required facilitators (program manager, data team, etc.) are contracted by OpCo, or OpCo operationalizes/hires internal employees, depending on the DAO’s decision, and the strategy is activated.\n\nTo reiterate:\n\n* Proposals and their execution can still be DAO-led end-to-end and outside of OpCo if delegates vote in this regard. OpCo is a tool for the DAO to leverage if needed.\n* The DAO-adjacent entity is required to be proactive, meaning that internal employees need to actively give feedback in the forums and participate in opinionated discussions.\n* Furthermore, if OpCo has available bandwidth, it should identify areas within its mandated verticals where improvements could be made. If there is no clear owner for such areas and addressing them would benefit the DAO, OpCo should take action. OpCo can create a proposal to define the strategy for addressing the targeted area, requesting funds to cover expenses, excluding costs for OpCo’s internal employees and other related operating expenses, and authorizing the DAO-adjacent entity to operationalize facilitators to execute the strategy.\n\nOpCo’s initial capital allocation is meant to cover the entity’s setup costs and operating expenses, including full-time internal staff salaries, recurring administrative costs, and OpCo’s oversight committee. After OpCo’s core team has been hired, the entity has demonstrated product-market fit and readiness to execute according to its complete mandate, OpCo could be leveraged to help develop a DAO-wide budget, in which case the DAO-adjacent entity could hold the budgeted capital for at least the Ecosystem Support and Financial Management categories. In this case, when proposals related to these verticals are passed, no capital would have to be moved from the treasury as OpCo would be able to cover all expenses from its holdings.\n\n## Establishing OpCo\n\nExploratory work on OpCo’s legal structure has already been initiated, but further effort and consultation with key stakeholders, delegates, legal parties, and the Arbitrum Foundation are needed to hammer down the exact structure. Any costs incurred by the Foundation for setting up the legal structure would be reimbursed from capital allocated to this initiative if this proposal were to pass.\n\nOpCo’s initial term will tentatively be 30 months (around 6 months for setup and 24 months for operations from the entity’s official initiation date). The initial term’s length has been chosen to allow ample time for any unforeseen delays in establishing the legal entity, ramping up and stabilizing its operations, and will enable OpCo to focus on more complex and long-term strategies and internalize top talent as a longer initial term provides predictability/job security for employees. Once the first term is coming to an end, the executive-equivalent internal personnel together with OpCo’s oversight committee—the Oversight and Transparency Committee (OAT), introduced below—are required to collaborate to create the continuation proposal for the DAO-adjacent entity. This is expected to cover, among other things, the second OpCo term’s length, the required budget, and any changes or improvements that should be made. It should be noted that if OpCo is required to internalize a vast amount of facilitator roles before a DAO-wide budget is put in place, OpCo might have to create a proposal that would allocate additional funds as its initial exemplary budget has been constructed to cover up to 12 internal full-time employees at different salaries.\n\nTo enable OpCo to successfully fulfill its mandate, the entity should, among other things, have the following initial operational capabilities, internal employees, and resources:\n\n* Internal Finances, Financial Rails, and Controls\n  * Appoint an external accounting and audit firm to maintain financial records and create yearly audits of financial statements and internal controls.\n  * Banking capabilities to be able to convert stablecoins into fiat currency and pay service providers not accepting tokens.\n* Legal\n  * Hire a full-time, in-house legal counsel.\n  * Obtain the required insurances that cover the DAO-adjacent entity as well as internal employees and the OAT.\n* Business-Critical Software\n  * Acquire any needed collaboration and communication tools, accounting and financial management software, human resources management systems, etc.\n* Internal Executive-Equivalent Employees\n  * Chief Chaos Coordinator\n    * Ensures that OpCo has the required internal resources, employees, and contracted service providers such that the DAO-adjacent entity can operate properly and execute strategies mandated by the DAO.\n    * Responsible for building and advancing the entity’s operational structure and managing workflows as initiatives are rolled into the organization and new focus areas are introduced.\n    * Similarly to other executive-equivalent personnel, accountable for adequate record keeping and internal controls.\n    * Collaborates with any other executive-equivalent personnel and the OAT to produce bi-annual oversight and financial reports.\n    * Together with executive-equivalent personnel and the OAT, in charge of creating the continuation proposal for OpCo’s next term.\n  * Chief of Coins\n    * Works with the relevant parties to produce a detailed, actual budget for OpCo, ratified by the OAT and the DAO. In the future, we expect the Chief of Coins to help facilitate a DAO-wide budget together with the relevant parties.\n    * Before a DAO-wide budget is created, responsible for requesting additional funds to ensure the entity’s operations if capital allocated for OpCo’s OpEx is close to being depleted.\n    * Verifies that allocated funds are custodied in a secure manner and utilized as intended.\n    * Makes sure that the OAT and the DAO have required visibility into ongoing expenses, how financials are expected to develop, and any other relevant considerations.\n    * Monitors Arbitrum’s financial performance and makes new recommendations based on this information.\n    * Closely collaborates with entities and individuals responsible for treasury management-related tasks, enabling the creation of a unified asset allocation and risk diversification strategy in line with the DAO’s vision, mission, and purpose.\n    * Manages accounting, payroll, and payment infrastructure.\n\n## OpCo KPIs\n\nWe are looking for community feedback on this front, but some potential, apparent KPIs for OpCo (h/t [@dk3](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/dk3) for most of these) include:\n\n* Talent Acquisition, Service Provider Selection, and Program Management\n  * Decrease in time-to-hire, compared to the DAO’s previous structure\n  * Employee engagement and satisfaction\n  * Retention rate\n  * Share of service providers meeting or exceeding performance metrics\n  * Cost savings or added value generated\n  * Diversity of service providers engaged\n* Ecosystem Coordination\n  * Time to solve open questions and other ambiguities\n  * Number of initiatives facilitated and their success\n  * Level of community engagement and stakeholder satisfaction\n  * Agility in adapting objectives\n  * Share of OpCo-initiated strategies accepted by the DAO\n* Performance Tracking and Transparency\n  * Timeliness of oversight and financial reports\n  * Share of data and metrics made publicly available\n  * Community engagement with reports\n\nUltimately, the OAT will be responsible for designing, finalizing, and implementing the relevant KPIs once OpCo is at a point where this can be sufficiently done. We envision that this will be a collaborative effort between the OAT and the DAO, with KPIs reviewed and adjusted periodically based on how OpCo evolves and the community’s feedback.\n\n## OpCo Accountability – The Oversight and Transparency Committee (OAT)\n\nThe OAT is a group of five individuals with the primary mandate to oversee OpCo’s operations, ensure the DAO maintains transparency into the DAO-adjacent entity, function as the coordinator between the DAO and OpCo, and establish clear communication channels with the other committees overseeing the separate DAO-adjacent entities such as the GCP and possibly the CapCo in the future should the DAO vote accordingly. More specifically, the OAT’s responsibilities include but are not limited to:\n\n* Accountability: Ensures that OpCo is not overstepping its mandate, over-hiring doesn’t take place, and execution is constrained solely to strategies approved by the DAO. Holds the executive-equivalent personnel accountable, helps produce and approves bi-annual oversight and financial reports, designs relevant KPIs for OpCo once the entity is at a point where this can be sufficiently done, and gives other quarterly updates to the community (such as how OpCo is progressing towards the KPIs designed by the OAT, any operational developments, etc.), reviews all relevant internal materials, and monitors that funds held in OpCo-related wallets are used correctly.\n* Operational Support: Provides assistance in the entity’s legal setup process, gives guidance on OpCo’s operational development, assists the executive-equivalent personnel in producing a continuation proposal for OpCo, and continuously guides OpCo-related contributors to align with the DAO’s will.\n* Hiring, Termination, & Authorization: The OAT, in collaboration with the Arbitrum Foundation, would hire the executive-equivalent personnel to the OpCo (the Chief Chaos Coordinator, the Chief of Coins, and any other positions of equivalent responsibility that may be introduced in the future) once the legal entity is established. The OAT will help onboard the executive-equivalent personnel and assist in the creation of a standardized onboarding process for future internal employees such that new hires’ expectations are managed properly. Once the first internal employees are hired, the OAT would act as the approving authority when OpCo enters into contracts with service providers or individual contributors, as well as greenlight salaries, larger spends, expenses, and budgets, having the authority to challenge decisions made within OpCo that may have a material, negative impact. Moreover, the OAT would be empowered to terminate service provider/individual contributor/etc. contracts as well as fire OpCo’s internal staff. If the OAT decides to take such an action, the concerned party will be suspended from their duties, and payments will be halted in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. Removal of OAT Members: OAT Members may be removed for a variety of reasons, including, but not limited to, a violation of a conflict of interest or other OpCo policies. In the event of a violation: (A) an OAT Member may call up an internal vote for removal with a memo detailing the alleged violation; (B) for a vote to remove an OAT Member to pass, it must have at least 4 out of the 5 OAT Members voting in favor; and (C) the ArbitrumDAO may also call for a vote to remove OAT Members at any time pursuant to a Temperature Check vote in accordance with the quorum and voting threshold requirements of a Temperature Check. The OpCo Team has the ability to call for a Temperature Check vote to remove an OAT Member as voted upon by the ArbitrumDAO. (i) The OpCo Team member may flag to another OpCo Team member that an election to remove an OAT Member via a Temperature Check vote is warranted; (ii) If such other OpCo Team member considers the request for removal to be warranted, then the OpCo Team member who originally made the flag may call for a removal election (subject to a 3 day feedback period, followed by a 7 day voting period) as a Temperature Check vote; (iii) In the event that a call to remove fails, the OpCo Team member who called for such Temperature Check vote cannot call another vote for removal for a period of 3 months. The process for electing a replacement for a removed OAT member will be equivalent to how the removed member was elected. I.e., if the removed member was elected through a DAO vote, the replacement member will be elected through a DAO vote. If the removed member was elected by the OAT, the OAT will elect the replacement member. A removed OAT member cannot be reappointed to the OAT. Further details on the OAT election process are given below.\n* Coordination: Actively engage with Offchain Labs and the Arbitrum Foundation to align on deliverables and serve as the liaison between delegates, key stakeholders, the wider DAO, and other DAO-adjacent entities’ oversight committees. The OAT will also initiate a monthly OpCo oversight call for community members to get updates on the most recent developments and for them to have the opportunity to make inquiries. A separate forum section will be created for OpCo.\n\n## OAT Election Process\n\nIf this proposal were to pass Snapshot, the formation of the Oversight and Transparency Committee would commence. The DAO would elect 3 individuals to the OAT, with these individuals then promptly appointing 2 additional members with specialized skill sets to ensure all Arbitrum stakeholders’ interests are represented and the OAT’s proficiencies are varied and complete. Additionally, the Arbitrum Foundation will be given an observing and non-voting sixth seat on the OAT similar to the GCP. OAT members are expected to be able to contribute at least 10 hours per week to OAT-related tasks.\n\nOAT applicants are required to apply as individuals to increase accountability. Applicants are required to disclose any current or possible future conflicts of interest in their applications, including but not limited to financial, personal, and professional. Applicants are also required to disclose all active contributor roles and payment streams related to the Arbitrum DAO that they, and entities that they have a professional or financial relationship with, have and are receiving. The application process for the 3 DAO-elected members would be initiated soon after the OpCo proposal passes an offchain vote and would run for ~3 weeks. Note that the application period can be extended if the size of the applicant pool is limited. A shutterized, weighted voting system will be utilized on Snapshot, and the 3 applicants with the most votes will be chosen as members of the OAT. The DAO-elected members should then prioritize appointing 2 additional members (required to be individuals as well). The 2 additional members don’t have to be appointed at the same time. The additional members will be added to the OAT optimistically, with the DAO having the ability to reject either/both of the additional members through a Snapshot vote (simple majority with at least 3% of all votable tokens voting either “For” or “Abstain”). All members will serve until the end of the first OAT term unless removed or they resign.\n\nWhile the same internal OpCo employees as well as contracted service providers and individual contributors will continue in their roles across OpCo’s terms if the DAO-adjacent entity is extended in the future, the OAT’s term is 12 months, with a re-election process initiated when the OAT’s term has around 3 months left. The DAO would again choose 3 members who then appoint 2 additional members. If the new cohort is different from the previous one, the previous OAT members are expected to help onboard the new members when the term is coming to an end. There are no consecutive term limits for OAT members. As the OAT is mandated to assist in OpCo’s setup process, the first OAT term will be slightly longer than subsequent ones since it will include the period from when the initial OAT members are selected to the establishment of the entity, plus 12 months from the entity’s official start date.\n\nAny individual may apply to the OAT. However, all appointed individuals that have a non-observing seat, as well as any companies with which these appointees maintain a professional or financial relationship, are required to relinquish any and all contributor roles within the Arbitrum DAO that were obtained through an official election or ratification process conducted via Snapshot or Tally. As long as an individual has a non-obseving seat on the OAT, they and their affiliates as defined above are prohibited from becoming an internal employee for OpCo, entering into service provider contracts with the entity, and applying to a contributor role related to the Arbitrum DAO that requires an official election or ratification process through Snapshot or Tally. Due to legal constraints, an OAT member and their affiliates as defined above cannot be members of another initiative’s or DAO-adjacent entity’s oversight committee. If an appointed individual or their affiliate as defined above sits on another oversight committee(s), they are required to resign from any such position(s) to be able to join the OAT.\n\n# NOTE: Due to Snapshot's character limit and the length of this proposal, the following sections have been omitted from this text compared to the forum post: OAT Applicant Requirements, OAT Compensation Structure, Governance and Compliance Requirements for OpCo, its Internal Employees, and the OAT, OpCo Financials and Costs, Snapshot Voting Structure, and Timeline.

        "body": "Non-Constitutional\n\nAbstract\nTLDR: This proposal funds a coalition led by Blockworks Research, Gauntlet, and Trail of Bits in order to aid in turning Arbitrum DAO members’ ideas into reality for a term of 12 months.\n\nThe Arbitrum Coalition is an organization initially made up of Blockworks Research, Gauntlet, and Trail of Bits. The Coalition aims to execute turnkey R&D work on behalf of the Arbitrum DAO. The Coalition’s mandate is to help steer the path from ideation in the forum to the optimal, efficient, and safe execution of proposals. In other words, being a steward in making the DAO’s visions a reality. The coalition will provide the necessary resources so that the DAO can make informed decisions.\n\nMotivation\nThe Arbitrum forum includes many worthwhile suggestions, but often lacks the required research, coordination, design, and risk assessment to move forward optimally. For example, iterating on proposals, drumming up delegate awareness, and finding the necessary partners to execute an idea are often difficult tasks. The Arbitrum Coalition’s mandate is to help distill information and accelerate governance decision-making so DAO participants can make informed decisions.\n\nThe Coalition has best-in-class experience/specialized expertise and personnel to execute on this venture and are all already notable contributors to the DAO. Areas of expertise include but are not limited to research, framework creation, risk assessment, secure code reviews, threat modeling, and testing enhancements.The Coalition will take the necessary steps to ensure the Arbitrum DAO has the resources it needs to accomplish its goals.\n\nAs a case study demonstrating the need for the Coalition, there was a lot of discussion around returning tokens 3 accidentally sent to the airdrop address back to the recipients. However, there was no one to call on to look at the landscape of how other protocols deal with this issue, design and implement a mechanism, or take it through the governance process. Likewise, the DAO has seen multiple grant programs suggested but has not been able to assess what has worked or not worked for similar programs in the past from an objective perspective. A multitude of such cases can be seen over Arbitrum DAO’s short tenure. These are the exact roles the coalition will undertake for ideas that gain traction among DAO stakeholders.\n\nHad the coalition existed during the time of the STIP proposal, it would have played a pivotal role in alleviating many of the inefficiencies and challenges delegates faced in the process. Blockworks Research and Gauntlet would have been prepared to develop comprehensive resources in support of the program end-to-end. From simplifying the evaluation of proposals with concise explanations and quantitative analysis to simplifying the voting process for delegates, and ultimately eliminating the need for a second process aimed at finding a service provider to monitor and analyze the program once live, by doing it ourselves. While we did make modest contributions in this regard 4 [2 1], our commitment would have been backed by substantially greater resources. In addition, the Coalition would (and will, should this proposal pass) do its own analysis of how this STIP program performed (after the fact) and provide feedback and recommendations on how to improve it in the future. The Coalition would have advocated for streamlined voting methods in place of 105 separate votes and created efficient voting dashboards, reducing the reliance on last-minute community-funded solutions. While it’s a missed opportunity, it highlights the potential for future value.\n\nAdditionally, complex mechanism designs like creating a permissionless validator set (BOLD) and sequencer design (timeboost) can be made more easily understandable for ARB delegates with support from the Coalition and researched impartially versus other potential solutions when proposals of this nature inevitably go on the forum.\n\nThe Coalition will help community stakeholders make the best possible decisions when it comes to AIPs. For example, Trail of Bits will aim to review each onchain proposal’s source code to ensure it achieves what is stated. This code review ability is a feat many delegates cannot achieve on their own and will be extremely useful to enable competent voting. Blockworks Research will distill the competitive landscape and underlying technology and Gauntlet will be able assess potential risks to the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\nAn example that demonstrates the value the Coalition will provide relates to support decision-making for the Arbitrum Plutus DAO proposal to Activate ARB Staking 8. Adding an inflation rate to the token poses concerns around risks to the token, new independently created staking contracts would need to be audited, and it would be helpful if delegates had access to quantitative research surrounding how inflation has impacted other tokens in the past. The Coalition can work together to provide objective analysis, quantitative research, and, if desired by the community, audits and execution for this proposal and others like it.\n\nThe Arbitrum Coalition will help the DAO reduce friction and operate effectively. Having three of the most experienced service providers in crypto best positioned and resourced to act at the behest of the DAO will be a tremendous value add.\n\nRationale\nOne key difference between Arbitrum and many other protocols is the immense power given to the DAO at token generation, which makes the DAO fully responsible for the coordination and growth of the protocol.\n\nArbitrum’s impressive decentralization demonstrates that the DAO can’t rely on single entities such as Offchain Labs or the Arbitrum Foundation. Any steps taken to help create a robust decentralized ecosystem of service providers so that the DAO is not dependent on any single entity is a step in the right direction. This way if any one organization falls, is negatively regulated, or otherwise encumbered, the protocol continues to march forward. The Arbitrum Coalition is the first initiative toward this overarching goal.\n\nAdditionally, the Coalition will aid in bringing more service providers subservient to the DAO. For example, it can be a steward in creating a methodology for other budgeted entities to come into existence.\n\nOther DAOs have a diverse ecosystem of service providers who help the DAO operate efficiently. The Coalition will be the first entity working towards this overarching structure such that over time the DAO will have an ecosystem of service providers executing on key roles like grants, development, growth, risk, legal, and more. This is a necessity in maintaining a truly decentralized and efficiently operating DAO.\n\nTwo additional benefits to funding the coalition will be the professionalization of DAO undertakings and growth for Arbitrum. All representatives of the coalition are professional and will bring competent and effective work and communication into the DAO that should help proposals move along with less friction. Additionally, the entities involved have a combined audience of far over 500,000 and will be sure to produce public content on the work we do for the DAO to hopefully drive more users and developers into the ecosystem.\n\nThe Coalition’s purpose is not to replace delegates, but rather to support, serve, and empower both them and the community as a whole with tools and deep insights to streamline effective decision making.\n\nIntroduction to The Coalition\nTrail of Bits: Since 2012, Trail of Bits has helped secure some of the world’s most targeted organizations and devices. They combine high-end security research with a real-world attacker mentality to reduce risk and fortify code. They have worked extensively with Offchain Labs and performed over 1,800 hours of security review of Arbitrum through four focused engagements, including Nitro and Arbitrum V2. Many firms in DeFi, including Optimism, Balancer, Uniswap, and Compound 1 trust Trail of Bits expertise to help secure their code, and you can find many more in their Publications repository. They’ve succeeded in finding vulnerabilities in highly verified systems 1 and providing the best solutions regardless of whether they invented them. They are relentless about raising the baseline in the communities they work, and have developed and made freely available some of the most-used security tools, reference guides, and security 1 research in the industry.\n\nGauntlet: Gauntlet 3’s quantitative optimization solutions drive rapid and sustainable growth for DeFi’s top protocols, DAOs, and ecosystems through research 2, reports 2, products 2, and bespoke engagements 4. Gauntlet has the longest track record in DeFi risk management, with a managed peak at $40+B for DeFi protocols such as Aave and Compound.\n\nBlockworks Research: Blockworks Research 1 is a team of analysts that delivers institutional-grade data-driven research and analysis for L1s, L2s, DeFi, and gaming/consumer applications. Our team is well-known in the industry for producing high-quality, actionable research reports and data dashboards covering various topics, including L2s, dApps, tokenomics, technical upgrades, emerging trends, governance, MEV, and market analysis. The team is divided into protocol-specific coverage so that our analysts are experts in their respective niches. Blockworks Research is a branch of Blockworks 1, a media company hosting conferences, podcasts, and an editorial site.\n\nKey Terms\nThe Arbitrum Coalition (“the Coalition”): A group initially made up of Blockworks Research, Gauntlet, and Trail of Bits whose mandate is to empower delegates with resources for making the most informed decisions possible.\n\nDAO Advocate: A single designated entity that maintains the ability to direct the coalition’s efforts. Functions as a referee between the DAO and the coalition. We suggest L2BEAT fulfill the role of the Advocate as a proven good actor for the Arbitrum DAO given their contributions and status in the DAO. The advocate will receive a stipend of $8,000 per month for their work. The advocate’s main responsibility is ensuring the DAO’s best interests are met by the Coalition.\n\nCoalition Member Termination: Ultimately, and above all, this Coalition will exist to serve the Arbitrum DAO. As such, individual members of the Coalition can be considered for replacement if their service does not meet the standards of this proposal or the DAO’s expectation. In the scenario a Coalition Member is considered for replacement, the DAO will need to examine the list of alternative vendors as well as any new market entrants eligible for consideration and pass a vote through\na Snapshot vote (reaching quorum) to stop the following payments to the vendor and replace said entity with a counterpart. The Coalition member will be considered terminated upon the vote passing. The same process may be executed in order to terminate and stop the stream of funds for the entirety of the Coalition and/or the DAO Advocate.\n\nCoalition Member Exit: As a malleable entity, if a member of the Arbitrum Coalition wishes to exit for any reason, they may do so by providing a two week lead time of departure and offer a list of viable replacements. Payments to the Member will stop 14 days after notice is given.\n\nSpecifications\nThe advocate will have the ability to call on the coalition for R&D efforts at their discretion and act as the DAO’s representative to ensure that the Coalition is working on the most value-added initiatives and providing beyond satisfactory value. The advocate will solely act on the DAO’s behalf and function as a facilitator. From analysis, to modeling, to payload the Coalition will tackle and streamline workstreams together.\n\nThe roles of the Coalition include but are not limited to:\n\nTrail of Bits: Reviewing onchain upgrade proposals to ensure that they align with the design and specification of the proposal through whitebox source code reviews. This role is particularly important given the prevalence of governance attacks, as seen with Tornado Cash. When no proposal requires a code review, Trail of Bits will focus on building content to help review further proposals, including tools (dedicated Slither detectors, fuzzing harness, proposal state diff visualizer, … ) and educational material (tutorial, checklist, code walkthrough, …)\n\nGauntlet: Will empower the Arbitrum DAO with an understanding of the optimal path for growth through our quantitative work. Decisions in ecosystems, specifically DeFi, benefit from design, research, and modeling to determine how to incentivize usage, maximize economic efficiency, protect systemic health, and plan for the future with rigorously validated insights. Examples of some recent work include Aave Killswitch 1, Uniswap incentive design 1, ongoing Arbitrum USDC migration 1, and Cost of MEV: Quantifying Economic (un)Fairness in the Decentralized World 1.\n\nBlockworks Research: Will provide objective data-driven research surrounding proposals to help delegates understand the context, competitive environments, and make more informed decisions. These reports may also be used as a tool for those writing proposals to improve their work. Additionally, Blockworks Research will function as the project manager handling logistics such as communication with the DAO and speaking with delegates. BWR is also able to input on mechanism design.\n\nThe Advocate is not a part of the coalition and exists purely to facilitate the DAO’s interests and direct the coalition. The Advocate is a representative of the DAO.\n\nWe believe it pertinent to get The Coalition stood up with haste and that Blockworks Research, Gauntlet, and Trail of Bits make up ideal initial members. That said, The Coalition is a malleable entity that can change, expand, and contract in domains and members as the DAO wishes. The Advocate as L2BEAT, likewise, should be looked at as a temporary seat that is always open to change. At the end of the 12 month period the domains and members should be reevaluated based on performance, lessons learned, and the adapting needs of the DAO as expected for the following 12 months.\n\nProjects\nThe Arbitrum Coalition aims to provide the following services as a first priority\n\nForum Proposal Review [BWR]\nWill provide impartial data-driven research surrounding proposals to help delegates understand the context and competitive environments such that they can make more informed decisions. These reports may also be used as a tool for those writing proposals to improve their work. The Advocate will direct the frequency and research topics of this work.\nReview on chain proposal code updates [Trail of Bits]\nWhite box security review of source code through a combination of manual and automated review, which may include a review the proposal for design flaws and identifying security and correctness properties\nReviews do not include proposals that are initiated by Offchain Labs and the Arbitrum foundation. These proposals are already going through security reviews (including by Trail of Bits)\nJust-In-Time Quants [Gauntlet]\nGauntlet’s Applied Research 4 and Risk teams will deliver quantitative review, research, and modeling or simulation for DAO proposals and initiatives relating to economic risk, design, or optimization.\nArbitrum Ecosystem Risk Dashboard [Gauntlet]\nA public ecosystem risk dashboard, similar to Aave 3 and Compound 1, provides users, investors, and voters continuous visibility into market risk throughout the ecosystem. Market risk metrics will include Volatility, CEX/DEX liquidity, and Gauntlet Safety Ratings, to inform ongoing risk-return optimizations. Gauntlet will hold monthly Risk Training sessions on how to use the dashboard from deployment to adoption and beyond.\nService Provider Onboarding Framework [BWR]\nEstablish a framework that the DAO may choose to utilize as a tool for onboarding future service providers.\nThe framework will include potential requirements and criteria; solutions for checks and balances; onboarding and offboarding processes for additional service providers including but not limited to legal counsel, operations, engineering, and marketing. All potential service providers can be thoroughly vetted by BWR, if the DAO chooses, ensuring sufficient staffing and resource availability.\nFollowing the DAO signaling an appetite for such an activity, Blockworks Research can propose and host a service provider onboarding process. The initial proposal will attempt to allocate a budget of ARB that service providers can then apply to receive a portion of through an RFP. The DAO will then vote which service providers to onboard. Recruiting, criteria, the process, budgeting suggestions, and facilitation can be handled by The Coalition. Though BWR is happy to take the proposal through the process, the DAO may opt to use the framework in any capacity it wishes, including ones that exclude BWR from future involvement.\nProject Management [BWR]\nWill handle communication with DAO surrounding coalition activities. Additionally, it will be the point of contact for DAO stakeholders and service providers. Blockworks is responsible for the overall execution of the coalition, documenting its success, escalating issues, and recommending solutions. Blockworks will maintain its own governance process to ensure continuity.\nOnce the first priority services are met, the Arbitrum Coalition can provide the following. Though these are examples of activities that can be executed on, the DAO, through The Advocate, will have decision making power over the scope of the coalition’s work.\n\nTooling Creation and Enhancement [Trail of Bits]\n\nDevelop and enhance tooling to enhance the security of the Arbitrum ecosystem and its proposals, including:\nSpecific static analysis bug detectors targeting code update.\nDevelop fuzzing capabilities to test the validity of the new upgrade states and verify that the state changing will not break any invariant\nVisualize the state of the governance contracts, in particular: the state of previous proposals, current emitted and delegates votes, how the tokens are delegated,\nVisualize and verify correct encoding of values used in the governance contracts and the action contracts.\nEducational material [Trail of Bits]\n\nProvide educational material and guidelines for reviewing upgrades procedures, including: Tutorials, Checklists, Code walkthrough\nResearch New Mechanisms [BWR]\n\nObjectively analyze and contribute to the design of new and existing mechanisms such as sequencers, fraud proofs, data availability solutions, and more. All research will be data and evidence driven evidence, where available. Projects to be prioritized by The Advocate.\nDelegate Engagement [BWR]\n\nWill create processes that incentivize delegates to be more active contributors to proposals rather than passive reviewers. For instance, a delegate incentives framework with accompanying requirements. Additionally, host regular cadence calls with delegates and those that authored proposals to work together on iteration.\nGrowth Initiatives [BWR]\n\nWill produce content surrounding coalition activities. Blockworks Research’s podcast, 0xResearch, will feature a segment on a weekly basis throughout the coalition’s term that will discuss the latest updates in Arbitrum the protocol or governance. Additionally, Twitter threads and newsletter mentions will be regularly provided in order to attract more developers and users into the Arbitrum ecosystem.\nCosts\nThe total cost of the coalition for the 1-year term will be based on the 30-day VWAP price of ARB on the day prior to the onchain proposal. One quarter of payment will be paid upfront to each Coalition Member, with a 274 day stream of the following ¾ starting 91 days from the AIP’s execution. The stream of funds will remain in DAO control and can be cut off at any time through an onchain DAO proposal. As of the ARB price on October 25th, this proposal is estimated to cos",

They also offer advanced tools for large-scale monitoring and analytics to empower data-driven decision-making.\n\n\n## **Proposed Scope of Work for Arbitrum:**\n\nAs Research Members, our primary goal is to strengthen Arbitrum’s position as the leading Layer 2 solution. For any network, the core requirements are a strong developer mindshare and capture, projects that address both emerging and institutional use cases, and deep liquidity across the ecosystem. To address these challenges, we propose the following research initiatives for the first two months.\n\n\n### **1. Expanding Arbitrum’s Ecosystem: A Strategic Analysis of Emerging Untapped Sectors and Institutional Opportunities**\n\n\n\n* Arbitrum has long been a hub for DeFi protocols, and this will continue. However, with the emergence of new market cycles and innovative primitives, it’s crucial to understand and expand into these new areas, both crypto-native and institutional.\n* For example, Polymarket, a prediction market app, accounted for nearly half of Polygon’s transaction volume in October 2024. As new primitives emerge, Arbitrum must capture protocols from these sectors.\n* This research aims to assess where Arbitrum lags behind competing Layer 2 and Layer 1 networks. The study will explore:\n    1. Crypto-native sectors: prediction markets, memecoins, decentralized science (DeSci), gaming, decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePIN), etc.\n    2. Institutional sectors: Treasuries, payments, funds, and bonds\n* We will conduct a data-driven analysis to identify key sectors with little to no presence on Arbitrum, evaluate their growth potential, and develop strategies to attract these protocols to the network.\n\n    Final Outcome: A comprehensive report identifying high-potential crypto-native and institutional sectors currently underrepresented on Arbitrum to develop targeted strategies for attracting protocols and expanding network dominance beyond DeFi.\n\n\n\n### **2. Catalyzing Capital Migration from Ethereum Mainnet to Arbitrum: A Strategic Framework for Liquidity Attraction**\n\nEthereum Mainnet currently has more than $60B of Capital sitting on it. Currently, Arbitrum is leading in terms of attracting these outflows from the Ethereum main net, but with more L1s and L2s coming in it’s necessary to constantly research and strategise on how Arbitrum can be the home for this liquidity.\n\nOur main aim with this research is to analyse the patterns of large capital holders and their migration patterns from the mainnet and interview them to find out any gaps in terms of security, infrastructure, and opportunities.\n\n\n\n* Recent advancements — such as live fraud proofs, enhanced cross-chain infrastructure, and an increasing number of protocols building on Arbitrum—make it the ideal platform for this migration.\n* This research will:\n    * Analyse the risk profiles of large capital holders\n    * Assess the current infrastructure for migration and identify gaps\n    * Engage with capital holders through interviews to develop a strategy for attracting liquidity\n* Key areas of focus will include:\n    * Identifying infrastructural gaps that hinder capital migration\n    * Conducting user interviews to understand views on Layer 2 migration\n    * Analysing capital ownership on the mainnet and categorising entities by likelihood of migration\n    * Exploring short-term strategies and incentives to encourage both migration and long-term retention of liquidity on Arbitrum\n\n    Final Outcome: Develop a comprehensive strategy to facilitate and incentivize the migration of $50 billion in capital from Ethereum mainnet to Arbitrum by addressing security concerns, infrastructure gaps, and stakeholder needs.\n\n\n\n### **3. Diversifying Arbitrum’s Network Revenue Streams: Beyond Sequencer Fees**\n\nThis research initiative aims to address the critical challenge of developing sustainable revenue streams for the Arbitrum network, acknowledging that the current reliance on sequencer fees is not sufficient for long-term sustainability. The study will conduct a comprehensive analysis of potential revenue models, examining both traditional blockchain monetization strategies and innovative approaches unique to Arbitrum’s architecture.\n\n**Research Methodology (Overview)**:\n\n\n\n* Analyze successful revenue models from other blockchain networks.\n* Evaluate emerging trends in network monetization.\n* Assess the feasibility of implementing various revenue streams within Arbitrum’s existing framework.\n\n    Final Outcome: A report with supporting data/dashboards to identify and evaluate innovative, sustainable revenue models beyond sequencer fees to ensure Arbitrum’s long-term financial stability and present actionable implementation strategies to the DAO\n\n\n\n### **4. Developer Experience in the Arbitrum Ecosystem: A Comprehensive Analysis of Tooling, Support, and Cross-Chain Infrastructure**\n\n\n\n* The Arbitrum Orbit cluster is rapidly expanding, with over 50 Layer 2 and Layer 3 projects currently being built, making it one of the largest chain clusters today. Arbitrum has also launched its multi-VM smart contract framework, Arbitrum Stylus.\n* As the Orbit cluster grows and Stylus is in place, it’s important to identify infrastructure bottlenecks and challenges developers face.\n* This research will involve interviews with both existing and new builders to:\n    1. Assess the current state of developer tooling on Arbitrum\n    2. Identify support needed from Orbit chain teams for continued growth\n    3. Explore challenges around intra-chain and cross-chain messaging within the Orbit ecosystem\n\n    Final Outcome: An actionable framework to enhance Arbitrum’s developer ecosystem by evaluating current tooling infrastructure, support systems, and competitive positioning through extensive developer interviews and comparative analysis with peer networks.\n\n\n\n# **The Block Research**\n\n**Name of Applicant & Applicant’s Representative (If applicable):** The Block Research Team, represented by Abraham Eid, Alice Hou\n\n**Telegram Handle (if applicable)**: @Abraham_0000, @alice_hou\n\n**LinkedIn Profile (if applicable)**: Abraham Eid, Alice Hou\n\n**The role being applied for (choose one):** Research Working Member\n\n**Hourly Rate (in USDC):** 500 (for the whole 5-member team)\n\n\n## **Experience:**\n\nThe Block boasts over 5 years of experience, backed by a team of more than 35 research specialists. They have serviced over 135 clients across Web3, FinTech, VC, and traditional finance sectors, including conducting research for leading ecosystems such as Arbitrum, Ethereum, Polygon, Solana and Avalanche.\n\nNotable projects led by Block Research include guiding a $2B+ public gaming firm on its Web3 gaming market entry strategy, collaborating with billion-dollar blockchain platforms on competitive benchmarking and development strategies, informing token distribution strategies for prominent Layer 2 protocols, and co-developing institutional-grade crypto index products for top-tier funds requiring resilience in volatile markets.\n\n\n## **Proposed Scope of Work for Arbitrum:**\n\nArbitrumDAO stands at a point where refining its governance frameworks and improving its ability to measure community engagement can drive meaningful progress. Our proposed work in the first two months of the six-month term will focus on two key initiatives: exploring complementary governance models and developing a comprehensive community metrics dashboard to evaluate the social adoption of Arbitrum’s various product offerings. These initiatives address the DAO’s current challenges, combining structured research and data tools to support transparency, efficiency, and community engagement.\n\n\n### **Complementary Governance Models**\n\nThe need for scalable and effective governance is clear from past initiatives like the Gaming Catalyst Program, where issues such as lagged operations and limited measurable impact surfaced. To address these challenges, we propose researching, designing, and piloting governance models such as futarchy and quadratic funding.\n\n\n\n* Futarchy: This approach uses prediction markets to align governance decisions with measurable outcomes, ensuring that proposals are evaluated based on their projected success. We will conduct simulations to model how this approach could guide decision-making by analyzing hypothetical scenarios.\n* Quadratic Funding: This model supports fair resource distribution by emphasizing broad participation in grant programs and community initiatives. Our analysis will optimize funding allocations by examining voting behaviors, incentives, and projected impacts.\n\nIn designing these frameworks, we will deliver data-driven insights, including sensitivity analyses to explore how different variables (e.g., voter turnout, proposal costs) influence their effectiveness. Our work will culminate in a detailed proposal for governance experiments tailored to ArbitrumDAO, providing stakeholders with actionable tools to address governance challenges.\n\n\n### **Community Metrics Dashboard**\n\nA vibrant and engaged community is critical for the success of any ecosystem. Developers often assess the community dynamics of an ecosystem when deciding if to build. Similarly, investors and users look for signals that indicate the ecosystem’s health and momentum. However, existing metrics like Twitter & Discord follower counts fall short of capturing the nuanced sentiment and engagement within a community.\n\nWe propose developing a community metrics dashboard that aggregates a wide range of indicators to provide a comprehensive view of ecosystem activity. This framework will allow developers, investors, and users to “test the temperature” of the ecosystem with data-driven insights. The dashboard would track, but not be limited to:\n\n\n\n* Social Media Metrics: Twitter impressions, engagement rates, and Google Trends data to gauge interest and visibility.\n* Sentiment Analysis: Aggregating community opinions from forums, tweets, and developer discussions to understand emotional and social trends.\n* Engagement Metrics: Measuring active participation in Discord, Telegram, and GitHub to assess the vibrancy of the ecosystem.\n\nThis dashboard will not only help developers evaluate which technical stack to build on, but also assist investors in identifying promising projects, and users in understanding the ecosystem’s momentum. The ultimate goal is to establish a robust framework for assessing community sentiment and engagement that can set a new standard for the industry.\n\nThrough these efforts, we aim to provide ArbitrumDAO with structured governance models and a scalable framework for measuring community engagement. Together, these initiatives will help the DAO address its immediate challenges while laying the groundwork for sustained growth and ecosystem vitality.\n\n\n# **Llama Research & Castle Capital ([@dl_research](https://x.com/@dl_research) & [@castle__cap](https://x.com/@castle__cap))**\n\n**Name of Applicant & Applicant’s Representative**: DefiLlama Research & Castle Capital\n\n**Email Address**: ryan@dlnews.com, atomist@castlecapital.vc (please contact both)\n\n**Telegram Handle**: [@cryptodurs](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/cryptodurs) and [@atomist](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/atomist)\n\n**Role**: Research Working Member\n\n**Hourly Rate (in USDC)**: $100 per hour\n\n\n## **Experience:**\n\nDefiLlama Research and Castle Capital bring complementary expertise to the table.

Ecosystem-Building Initiatives (Target = DAO-Driven Development Programs)**\n\nProblem: Arbitrum lacks a competitive strategy to reward innovation, limiting its ability to attract and retain top-tier developers critical to its reputation as a home for disruptive builders.\n\nGoal: Position Arbitrum as the premier blockchain for innovation by optimizing grant funding and incentivizing novel protocols.\n\nDeliverables:\n\n\n\n* RPGF Analysis: Evaluate the impact of Retroactive Public Goods Funding (RPGF) models in competing ecosystems.\n* Innovation Grants: Propose funding mechanisms to reward long-term, high-impact projects.\n* Grant Prioritization: Identify top Arbitrum-aligned protocols for strategic funding.\n* Builder Engagement: Suggest strategies to strengthen relationships with existing projects.\n\nPost-Work Unlock: A roadmap for a grant-driven growth workstream to attract top builders and drive sustainable ecosystem expansion.\n\n\n### **3. Improving Orbit Chain Experience & Ecosystem Integration (Target = Ecosystem)**\n\nProblem: Orbit chains often feel disconnected from Arbitrum One and other orbits, with fragmented liquidity and suboptimal UX. While full interoperability relies on Offchain Labs, abstracting chain complexities can drive immediate improvements and enhance ecosystem cohesion.\n\nGoal: Address UX gaps, simplify chain abstraction, and align Orbit chains with the broader ecosystem while exploring future technical solutions as they mature.\n\nDeliverables:\n\n\n\n* Non-Technical UX Solutions: Propose immediate improvements to UX, including chain abstraction to streamline user interactions and reduce complexity.\n* Bridge Design Analysis: Compare intent-based bridges across ecosystems and suggest best practices for Arbitrum.\n* Messaging Layer Review: Evaluate existing messaging layer solutions for Orbit chains, focusing on user-centric abstraction of chain communication.\n* Alignment with Ethereum Plans: Analyse how proposed solutions align with Ethereum’s interoperability and chain abstraction strategies.\n\nPost-Work Unlock: Clear recommendations for improving UX and advancing Orbit chain adoption while leveraging chain abstraction for seamless user experiences.\n\nWe also plan to include the following projects in our Scope of Work, which are detailed in ‘Additional Details’ on the forum (i) Arbitrum’s Search for its Identity (ii) New Sector Mapping and Outreach.\n\n\n# **Blockworks Advisory**\n\n\n\n* Name of Applicant & Applicant’s Representative [If Applicable]:\n    * Blockworks Advisory\n        * Representatives: [EffortCapital](https://x.com/EffortCapital), [magicdhz](https://x.com/magicdhz), [GoldDefi](https://x.com/GoldDefi), [0xMims](https://x.com/0xMims)\n* Email Address:\n    * Blockworks Advisory: advisory@blockworks.co\n* Telegram Handle (if applicable):\n    * Blockworks Advisory representatives:\n        * @effortcapital, @magicdhz, @carolinagold, @Mims0x, @rmalakaib\n* Role being applied for: Research-Oriented Member\n* Hourly Rate (in USDC): $195/hr per individual\n\n\n## **Experience:**\n\nBlockworks has established itself as a premier source of deep technical and protocol-specific research over the past two and a half years. During its participation in ARDC V1, Blockworks played a pivotal role in recovering/saving over 3.7M ARB in misused or unallocated funds for the DAO and Foundation (e.g. Furucombo and Synapse) while also facilitating important discussions around Timeboost.\n\nAdditionally, they developed a comprehensive Arbitrum data dashboard, delivering valuable insights into the platform's on-chain activity and financial metrics. They also support other leading protocols such as the Solana Foundation, Lido, and Ethena among others.\n\n\n## **Proposed Scope of Work for Arbitrum:**\n\n\n### **1. Unified Incentives Framework (Incentive Program Design Assistance)**\n\nThrough our initial ARDC STIP work, Blockworks Advisory is uniquely positioned to assist in the development of the next incentive program scheduled to launch in 2025. Blockworks Advisory could work closely with the Incentives Working Group and other major stakeholders to create a Unified Incentives Framework that applies previous best practices and lessons learned to optimize ROI in various objective functions. While we will not administer the incentives or perform the operations (management, etc) we will help structure the proposal, and the program for the greater good of the ecosystem leveraging research accomplished. As the embargo on incentives ends in Q1, this would likely be our first deliverable, and would span 2 months worth of time in our term. Additionally, we believe this deliverable to be of great value to the DAO, given the DAOs past initiatives, STIP and LTIP, and the likely continuance of incentives post-embargo. The Foundation has also weighed in and has provided incentives as a suggested area of work for the Research member, found here - [https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrum-foundations-recommendations-for-ardc-deliverables/27686](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrum-foundations-recommendations-for-ardc-deliverables/27686).\n\nBelow are other deliverables that we can work on in addition to or besides the Incentive Framework.\n\n\n### **2. Timeboost Revenue Allocation Framework**\n\nWhile Timeboost is an innovative solution coming to Arbitrum that will likely be a positive catalyst for DAO revenue, there hasn’t been a community-wide discussion on how the revenue should be allocated and whether it makes sense for the DAO to capture all proceeds or redistribute it to impacted LPs/protocols.\n\n\n### **3. Orbit Chain Strategy**\n\nProvide the DAO with a path towards aligning the ARB token with the growth of the Orbit tech stack, taking lessons learned from other ecosystems (Cosmos, Polkadot, Optimism, zkSync, etc). Outlining a procurement vs ownership model where we identify what products/services the DAO should own (e.g RaaS, block explorer, data indexing, etc).\n\n\n### **4. General Data Services**\n\nSimilar to the [Multisig Support Service](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rfc-arbitrum-multi-sig-support-service-mss/23737) proposed by Entropy Advisors and R3gen Finance to reduce operational spend and increase proposal efficiency, Blockworks Advisory could become a shared data service provider that any Arbitrum working group or initiative (including the Foundation) could tap into to fulfill all data needs. We have the most [comprehensive](https://x.com/blockworksres/status/1853879698029527453) Arbitrum data in the industry, including DAO financials, and can leverage this to empower the various stakeholders in the community.\n\n\n### **5. Developer-centric Strategy Framework**\n\nIn last year’s [Developer Report from Electric Capital](https://www.developerreport.com/developer-report), Arbitrum saw a troubling decline in active developers in the ecosystem. This deliverable would be outlining the developer pipeline specifically in regards to Arbitrum, and provide suggestions for where DAO funding could possibly aid in the development process.\n\n\n### **6. Financial Audit of Arbitrum Grants Programs**\n\nThe Arbitrum Grants program is expansive, and a financial audit would simply be a retroactive analysis of the Arbitrum Grants program to date to determine ROI for the ecosystem.\n\n\n# **Messari**\n\n\n\n* Name of Applicant & Applicant’s Representative (If applicable): Messari Protocol Services\n* Telegram Handle (if applicable): @ jackpurdy @ alex_barry22\n* LinkedIn Profile (if applicable): [Messari | LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/messari/)\n* The role being applied for (choose one): Research Working Member\n* Hourly Rate (in USDC): $145/hour\n\nOur blended hourly rate of $145 reflects the expertise and resources required to deliver exceptional research and insights for the ArbitrumDAO.

        "body": "**Voting Option Clarification:**\nFor - Adopt the Arbitrum Treasury Management Council\nAgainst - Continue forward with the TMC, GMC, and STEP Committee Mandates.\n\n# Abstract\nThe Arbitrum DAO’s treasury management strategy and execution have become fragmented due to the numerous committees overseeing various initiatives.\n\nWe propose phasing out the TMC, GMC, and STEP committees and replacing them with a canonical 3-unit committee (Arbitrum Treasury Management Council) to enhance the cohesion/effectiveness of the DAO’s treasury management strategy.\n\nThe new Arbitrum Treasury Management Council comprises:\n\n**Voting Body**\nOAT - Approves or denies allocation recommendations from the Execution Body, and, in rare cases, initiates emergency actions that it deems necessary to pull out capital from existing allocations\n**Execution Body**\nEntropy Advisors - Responsible for strategic financial management, data transparency, and procurement\n**Communications Body**\nOpCo (Entropy until entity operationalized) - Ensures council members are delivering with excellence, mandates are met, and relays information between the DAO and the council\nIn addition to the 3-unit council, the following AAEs will serve observatory roles to ensure wider ecosystem alignment and smooth operations as it relates to fund deployment:\n\n**Observatory Body**\nArbitrum Foundation - Manages movement of funds/custody (Note that any of the AF’s deliverables can be moved to OpCo over time through a DAO vote)\nOffchain Labs - Inform the aforementioned council members of any ongoing BD efforts that may conflict with fund allocations\nDelegates will approve high-level strategies and capital allocations to the council. More granular decisions suggested by the Execution Body (e.g., reallocating capital across providers, or allocation recommendations) have to be approved by the OAT, which has DAO representation as well as key members from OCL and the AF.\n\nAll of the council members have funding sources in place, so there will be no additional overhead related to paying these contributing entities. In terms of the remaining balance to pay the previous councils/committees (TMC & GMC) that currently sits with the AF, this will be repurposed to cover service providers’ costs for specialized deliverables that the new canonical council does not possess competency to fulfil, e.g., granular risk, legal, etc. The roles of each council member are further defined below.\n\n# Rationale\nThe Arbitrum DAO now has 3 separate initiatives related to its treasury management strategy between the TMC, GMC, and the STEP committee. The TMC focuses on ARB and stablecoins, while the GMC focuses on ETH allocations, and the STEP committee focuses on RWAs. The following entities/individuals sit on councils overseeing these initiatives, with their respective pay defined below:\n\nTMC\nAustin Campbell\n$20k per milestone, total of $60k earn-able, $20k already claimed\nMake Markets\n$20k per milestone, total of $60k earn-able, $20k already claimed\nThree Sigma\n$20k per milestone, total of $60k earn-able, $20k already claimed\nGMC\nCallen (Formerly Wintermute)\n$20k per milestone, total of $60k earn-able, $20k already claimed\nLlama Risk\n$20k per milestone, total of $60k earn-able, $20k already claimed\nEntropy Advisors\nWaived Payment\nSTEP I\nCommittee (mandate completed):\nKarpatkey, GFX Labs, Steakhouse, Nethermind, North Lakes Legal, Treasury WG Lead (Devansh)\n150k ARB, 25K for each member\n50k ARB to the Arbitrum Foundation for conducting due diligence/drafting legal agreements\nProgram Manager (mandate ends in September ‘25)\nSteakhouse original allocation: 100k ARB\nFaced a shortfall due to fees being denominated in USD. $174K (total fee) - ~$87K (received from ARB liquidation) to be paid from yield earned through the program\nSTEP II\nCommittee (mandate completed)\nKarpatkey, GFX Labs, Entropy Advisors, Nethermind, North Lakes Legal, Treasury WG Lead (Devansh)\n125k ARB in total (Entropy Advisors waived payment, thus 25k ARB less than STEP 1)\nTo summarize, the DAO has ~$581,000 of overhead associated with treasury management activity, assuming an ARB price of $0.285 (realised dollar-denominated spend is higher, as ARB price has fallen since previous payments to contributors). The total AUM amongst all of these programs is approximately $50M, with the total yield earned on the underlying thus far amounting to ~$590k. The DAO has just recently broken even on its treasury management initiatives. However, it is worth noting that not all of the funds have been deployed from the TMC and GMC proposals, which are expected to accelerate passive yield inflows.\n\nEntropy Advisors has been involved in all 3 committees, and we see some areas in need of improvement. Outside of cutting down on the dollar-denominated expenses associated with running these programs in a way that only scales with the size of the programs, the sheer number of people involved in the act of treasury management without clear responsibilities is counterintuitive. It is difficult to coordinate calls across so many teams’/individuals’ calendars, none of the committees actually speak to one another thus resulting in a fragmented strategy for the Arbitrum DAO’s treasury, each committee usually ends up in a state where a minority of members ultimately produce a majority of the work required for execution, communication between applicants and individual committees/their members often becomes fragmented (the applicant may not know who to reach out to in order to discuss certain things relevant to the application process), etc. Additionally, all of these committee members have varying degrees of insight into things in the pipeline for the Arbitrum ecosystem, which often sets these contributors up to make misinformed decisions due to missing context.\n\nWith Timeboost officially live, the DAO treasury has again reached >7,500 ETH since the last TM v1.2 proposal passed on Tally, as well as other ongoing initiatives such as the GCP that will generate additional revenue over time, we must be able to deploy some of these assets into yield bearing strategies as they accrue to the treasury. It’s time to reduce fragmentation and streamline the decision-making processes.\n\nFour open discussions on this matter were hosted on April 30, 2025, May 14, 2025, May 28, 2025, and June 11, 2025, with recordings available here, here, here, and here. We recommend watching these, and joining future calls on the topic if you have strong opinions to share.\n\n# Specifications\nIn line with the new vision laid out by the Arbitrum Foundation, we propose that Entropy Advisors serves as the “Treasurer” with the OAT in place to approve/deny usage of budgets allocated to treasury initiatives, with the council including two of the most aligned AAEs, the AF and OCL, as observatory members to help inform and execute on strategy. This will enable the DAO to approve high-level strategies that do not go against Arbitrum’s broader strategy, considering the insight the AF and OCL will have in regards to ongoing BD efforts/opportunities as well as any operational complexities related to deploying and custodying funds. It will also reduce overhead, unify strategy, and empower Entropy to outsource specific needs to service providers with concrete deliverables on an as-needed basis, thus decreasing the principal-agent problem we face under the current structure with fragmented committees.\n\nEntropy Advisors will have the autonomy to make decisions with funds pre-approved by the DAO, but all decisions must be passed by the OAT with ⅗ approval. Any decision that does not receive ⅗ approval from the OAT will be considered denied and no funds will be allocated. This includes reallocating from one asset/strategy to another, thus giving the DAO the ability to respond to changing market conditions and to hold vendors accountable. Any/All fund movements will be accompanied with an update on the forum in order to keep the wider community informed. Again, this process only pertains to funds that have already been approved for allocation by the DAO, but the standard governance process will always be required to earmark funds for deployment. Assets already approved by the DAO for deployment (STEP I&II, TMC, GMC) will be eligible for reallocation, in accordance to the process herein, per this proposal’s passing.\n\n![TM Flow 1.jpg](ipfs://bafybeietgujzicouxe2jhf3p2kmgvase2wrh6sz2d27dpin7zloin5ardq)\n\n![TM Flow 2.jpg](ipfs://bafybeie7xajd73mamx7o63cmv56lgs2cjiwbwkztc3uwx7hevvibhix4qu)\n\nThe non-exhaustive, high-level responsibilities of this council and its observers will include:\n\n**Voting Body**\n\n**Allocations Review** - OAT\n\nApprove or Deny allocation decisions presented by the Treasurer\nThe OAT will also be able to initiative emergency actions E.g., Alert the custodian to perform emergency withdrawals due to an exploit, or other emergency actions that it deems necessary to pull out capital from existing allocations\nExecution Body\n\n**Treasurer** - Entropy Advisors\n\nDAO Budget Creation\nFinancial Forecasting\nHigh-level KPI development / Data transparency through analytics\nNet Working Capital Management\nQuarterly Reporting\nStrategy Formation / Allocation Recommendations\nProtocol & Active/Passive Treasury Funds Manager Procurement\nRisk Management & Miscellaneous - Likely areas for outsourcing to SPs\n\nAdditional legal/compliance assistance beyond the Arbitrum Foundation’s scope (we expect the custodian, so in this case the AF, to lead this SP onboarding given their insight into what is needed beyond their in-house competency)\nDevelop and maintain a comprehensive risk framework/monitoring system for treasury allocations (e.g., liquidity, counterparty, smart contract risks, etc.)\nCoordinate stress-testing and scenario modeling for treasury assets under various market conditions\nEvaluate traditional financial assets under consideration, such as tokenized MMFs, private credit instruments, etc., and determine their viability/safety as a DAO-treasury asset\nMiscellaneous needs that may arise from time to time\nCommunications Body\n\n**DAO Orchestration** - OpCo (Entropy Advisors in the interim)\n\nResponsible for every party delivering with regard to their respective responsibility areas\nPost updates related to council votes and DAO allocations\nCreate proposals and present them to the DAO as they relate to funding requests, with direct input from the rest of the council\nContract SPs, taking in feedback from the wider council, to fulfill the work related to the “Granular Risk Management & Miscellaneous” functions defined below. Note that the AF will assume this responsibility until the OpCo has been operationalized.\nInform proposers whether they should be requesting to-be-monetized ARB from treasury, or stables currently deployed in strategies through coordination with the Arbitrum Foundation.\n**Observatory Body**\n\n**Operational Execution** - Arbitrum Foundation\n\nAccounts payable/Payroll (ensure service provider payments are processed)\nARB to stable/dollar conversions\nCompliance (KYC/KYB)\nCustodian of the funds on behalf of the DAO\n**Ecosystem Support** - Offchain Labs\n\nLead institutional adoption of RWAs on Arbitrum, and help inform the wider council on ideal STEP allocations in the future based on strategic goals\nConnect the “execution body” of the council with relevant app developers through their deep network of Arbitrum builders\nEnsure the “execution body” is informed of any ongoing BD efforts that may conflict with allocation decisions\nThe remaining funds from the TM v1.2 proposal that were allocated to pay TMC and GMC members for their work (1M ARB) will be repurposed to this canonical treasury council to contract SPs to fulfill required duties as they arise, likely related to the “Risk Management & Miscellaneous” deliverables defined above.\n\nGiven that all 5 of the entities involved in the Arbitrum Treasury Management Council are DAO-funded AAEs (or in the case of OCL, project founders), it does not make sense to have a mechanism in place to remove specific members. However, it is important to ensure the DAO remains in complete control over its treasury assets. As such, any DAO contributor can disband the Arbitrum Treasury Management Council entirely by getting a proposal through Snapshot that garners 3% of the votable token supply in favor of the council’s disbandment. The onus of replacing this initiative with a new structure i.e., council members, budgeting/forecasting/ reporting cadence, risk management, SP procurement, etc., will fall on the contributor that is proposing the abolishment of the Arbitrum Treasury Management Council. The contributor seeking abolishment will also need to define what happens to the currently deployed assets e.g., funds pulled from strategies and returned to the treasury. We expect delegates to be cognizant of this, and to hold contributors that seek abolishment of the Arbitrum Treasury Management Council to high standards in regards to the defined transition from the proposed structure herein to its proposed replacement. Also note that the responsibility of fund movement and custody can be transferred to OpCo via a DAO vote on Snapshot that garners 3% of the votable token supply in favor/abstain of the shift of responsibility.\n\n# Hypothetical Workflow Example:\n\nThe council identifies additional ETH in the DAO’s treasury that is not currently being utilized and wishes to allocate these funds to begin earning additional yield. The \"DAO Orchestration” member works with the “Treasurer” member to draft a proposal to the DAO seeking to earmark these funds for deployment, taking into account various risk factors and the current treasury composition. The AF and OCL would be charged with providing input on the draft based on compliance and deployment feasibility, as well as any upcoming strategic partnerships that could align well with a DAO deployment of capital. The general goals of the deployed capital will be loosely defined in these proposals, as to provide the treasurer with flexibility, but also to impose guardrails/ensure the capital is deployed in a manner that achieves the goals the DAO desires. Prior to the DAO Orchestration member posting this proposal to the forum, a ⅗ consensus amongst the OAT will be required.\n\nAssuming this proposal passes through the standard Arbitrum DAO governance process and the funds are transferred to the AF’s control, the Treasurer would begin drafting outbound materials to conduct protocol outreach/SP procurement for fund deployment. Similar to the proposal above seeking funds from the DAO, a ⅗ consensus will be required amongst the OAT prior to any funds being deployed. Likewise, if the Treasurer wishes to reallocate funds from STEP I/II to a different provider because the initial provider did not execute on what was originally promised (e.g., failing to deploy the tokenized asset on Arbitrum One), this will require ⅗ approval from the OAT. This ensures that funds can be moved without hurting relationships with existing vendors due to the negative PR that could stem from a reallocation that currently requires a high-profile DAO vote.\n\nNote that, as always, the DAO remains in ultimate control. Any allocations made by this council can be clawed back to the DAO treasury, or be forced to be reallocated by the Execution Body, via a Snapshot vote that garners 3% of the votable token supply in favor of the clawback or forced reallocation. Also note, the OAT will be able to initiate emergency actions with ⅗ approval to pull out funds from a prior allocation, with the rationale posted to the forum immediately.\n\n# DAO’s Checking Account\nIt was made evident in the recent community call, as well as on the forum, that the DAO needs to have a process for spending stables/cash during periods in which it would rather not monetize treasury ARB to cover dollar-denominated expenses, or to cover service provider shortfalls that arise due to downward ARB price volatility.\n\nMoving forward, we propose the “DAOs checking account” is taken over by the Arbitrum Foundation with full discretion on how it can be spent. For example, it can be used to cover service provider shortfalls or to cover dollar-denominated expenses in proposals that pass through Tally. Note, if a draft DAO proposal wants to access the funds, then it is recommended they contact the Arbitrum Foundation who will decide whether the assets can be used, before putting the DAO proposal up for a vote.\n\nThe Arbitrum Foundation will be required to adhere to any future structures that arise, including, but not limited to, a DAO budget or Net Working Capital requirements. This requirement is only related to the DAO’s treasury management initiative, and does not pertain to the AF’s current operations / existing budget. The AF will be required to confer with the Treasurer (Entropy) and inform the DAO Orchestration member (OpCo once operationalized) so that financial frameworks are followed, capital movements can be accounted for, and the DAO stays informed. The Treasurer will continually evaluate Net Working Capital developments, and make proposals to the DAO accordingly to ensure short-term liabilities can be met.\n\nPlease note that after speaking with the AF on May 30th, some changes to the “DAO’s Checking Account” section were made.\n\n# Costs\nThere will be no additional overhead related to these contributing entities, as they aren’t being compensated for their services in relation to the treasury management strategy and execution under this proposal. As such, the costs associated with this proposal, excluding SP expenses required to fulfill Risk/Miscellaneous-related work, will be zero. The budget already approved to pay the GMC and TMC members is expected to cover all overhead related to needed SPs over the near-to-medium term.\n\nThere are likely to be indirect costs associated with each fund deployment (treasury management fees, tokenized RWA fees, etc), and all of these costs will be disclosed in quarterly updates from the Treasurer or in the regular updates posted by the DAO Orchestration member.\n\nNote that this proposal will only require a Snapshot vote that garners 3% of the votable token supply in favor/abstain of the Arbitrum Treasury Management Council’s implementation, and thus mark the wind down of the GMC, TMC, and STEP committee mandates. This is in-line with terms laid out in the treasury management v1.2 proposal.\n\n# Closing Thoughts\nThrough our proposed architecture herein, the DAO will deploy assets from its treasury with lower overhead and more accountability over each member’s contributions, develop a more cohesive overall strategy, provide applicants with clear points of contact with streamlined channels for receiving proposal feedback, have comprehensive financial reporting/live monitoring, will not make any decisions without maximum context through the AF’s and OCL’s involvement, and will have dedicated resources to ensure risk evaluation over all treasury management initiatives in order to maximize safety over the DAO’s assets.\n\nWe look forward to the community’s feedback.\n\n**Disclaimer**: Although Entropy Advisors and the rest of the Arbitrum Treasury Management Council will do everything possible to ensure the safety of deployed assets, crypto is experimental technology from a security and economic design perspective. Entropy Advisors, or other members of the Arbitrum Treasury Management Council, cannot be held responsible/liable for any of the risks associated with fund deployment.",

        "body": "**Timeline of Updates:**\n\n*Oct 24 - MVP posted*\n*Oct 30 - Mission statement updated*\n*Nov 1 - Proposal put on hold while seeking final feedback.*\n*Dec 9 - Purpose statement updated.*\n*Dec 12 - Will proceed to Snapshot.*\n\n## Non-Constitutional\n\n## Abstract\n\nFollowing extensive conversations with stakeholders and active delegates, and feedback on our initial mission/vision/goals [proposal](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/unifying-arbitrum-dao-s-vision-mission-and-goals/26537), Entropy Advisors has decided to modify our approach for aligning the Arbitrum DAO on its end state goals and the more granular strategy through which these will be reached. This approach can be distilled into three separate phases:\n\n1. Achieving wide-reaching agreement on why the Arbitrum DAO exists and what it is trying to accomplish. In other words, what is the Arbitrum DAO’s mission, vision, and purpose. The MVP is purposefully simple and unambiguous such that it is absolutely clear what the DAO is ultimately working towards, with additional complexity only introduced when strategic goals to reach the end state are created. Without an agreed upon north star, it is impossible to evaluate how one-off strategies and initiatives assist the DAO to reach its goals, simply because there is currently a wide set of different opinions on what the DAO is striving to achieve. Additionally, most—if not all—initiatives and strategies are evaluated in isolation without considering how they play into wider frameworks. While the MVP might feel too abstract, its purpose is to enable more complexity to be stacked on top of it through iterative efforts.\n\n2. Once the DAO’s end state goals have been solidified, anyone will have the opportunity to propose a strategy matrix made up of 12- and 24-month focus areas for the DAO through an open process named Strategic Objective Setting (SOS). These areas should have well-established guidelines for tangible implementation and what they aim to accomplish, as well as only have one purpose—optimally moving the DAO towards its end state. This is the step that will allow the DAO to refocus its attention on the most critical deliverables and judge how one-off initiatives fit into its short- to medium-term priorities. Entropy Advisors is working on the SOS proposal in tandem with the MVP, and it will be posted as a subsequent separate proposal with the DAO choosing one matrix of strategies as the winner.\n\n3. Combined with financial forecasting, the SOS will enable the DAO to budget itself for the next 12/24 months by earmarking capital to each strategic focus area ratified in step 2. Arguably, the most important aspect of this step is for the DAO to align on how profitable/loss-making it wants to be during the coming year(s). Lastly, with clearly defined strategic focus areas, it should also become simpler for the DAO to begin marketing its efforts since, e.g., a clear identity, as well as narratives, can be built around each of the DAO’s focus areas.\n\n![MVP image 1.png](ipfs://bafkreihzcndqv6am5ba2uqx3nnecirushrkktinzlbrqkn46spaxu3767i)\n\nWhen it comes to this proposal, we’ve strived to distill numerous key stakeholders’ and delegates’ thoughts and ideas into a cohesive mission, vision, and purpose for the Arbitrum DAO, presented below. It’ll naturally be impossible to align all DAO participants on the DAO’s end state goals because of the ecosystem’s diversity. However, for this exercise to be successful, the passed Mission, Vision, and Purpose must have buy-in from a clear majority of the DAO and cannot be unilaterally pushed forward.\n\nAfter looking into other ecosystems, we concluded that [Lido](https://research.lido.fi/t/the-guided-open-objective-setting-exercise-goose-proposal-a-genesis-step-to-jump-start-a-dao-wide-goal-setting-exercise-and-cadence/5355) currently has the best-suited mechanism to strategically define objectives in a decentralized and efficient manner, which is why we are striving to implement a program for Arbitrum that takes influence from Lido. We thank Lido DAO contributors who set a great example of how decentralized governance should go about this exercise.\n\n## Call to Action\n\nThe Arbitrum DAO’s Guiding Principles are as Follows:\n\n### Purpose (Meaning): Defend and guide the Arbitrum ecosystem. \n\n### Mission (Action): Empower people with the freedom to build their best onchain world.\n\n### Vision (Aspiration): Arbitrum is home to the universal shift onchain.\n\n![MVP Image 2.png](ipfs://bafybeieolo4gzttjfxjoa3rv5werhlpfdo36cagyniy7jqzhbcbmcizkci)\n\n\n## Motivation + Rationale\n\nThe current lack of defined mission, vision, purpose, and strategic objectives today has created a notable, twofold inefficiency in the DAO:\n\n1. Each organization operating in the DAO must extrapolate for itself what it should work towards that contributes the most value to Arbitrum. Questions arise such as:\n* Should my organization work toward enabling operational sustainability and painting a picture of ARB as a productive asset?\n* Growth of the technology stack:\n    i. Orbit?\n    ii. Stylus?\n    iii. Arbitrum One?\n* What role should public goods have within Arbitrum?\n\nWith a lack of clear strategic focus areas, being an effective DAO operator becomes difficult. Redundant and conflicting work turn into a reality due to a lack of alignment and organizational structure.\n\n2. The absence of concrete goals has made it challenging for the DAO to judge the effectiveness of initiatives. A system has been created where all the DAO can effectively do is judge “Did this organization work hard” but lacks the ability to judge “Did this organization do a good job moving Arbitrum forward towards its end state goals.”\n\nAdditionally, a clear vision is required for the DAO to pursue its own brand and marketing strategies. It is time to align on this vision. If Arbitrum DAO executes its mission successfully, what does Arbitrum’s place in the world look like? What are the ecosystem and its numerous contributors (the DAO and its programs, the Foundation, and development teams) working towards? What sets Arbitrum apart from competitors?\n\nThe goal of the MVP proposal is to align the DAO on the highest level of purpose, enabling the subsequent SOS to build on top of it and function as a framework through which delegates and key stakeholders can propose and choose a set of concrete short- and mid-term goals for Arbitrum DAO. This approach helps ease Entropy's concerns with our [initial approach](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/unifying-arbitrum-dao-s-vision-mission-and-goals/26537), where the proposal promised everything under the sun as it continually expanded with more (and sometimes conflicting) opinions into the mix. Additionally, we believe our original desire to set out on a 5-year plan left too much room for ambiguity without tangible steps to be taken.\n\nThus, the scope has been reduced. Even within the objectively high-level MVP proposal herein, there are still likely to be areas of contention, such as whether Arbitrum should align with Ethereum more closely, whether the DAO should put a greater emphasis on its flagship Arbitrum One product, and whether the delegates will actually feel empowered to use the MVP as a driving force for their actions.\n\nThe MVP will be the foundation for most actions taken by the Arbitrum DAO going forward, especially when it comes to short- to medium-term strategy setting and budgeting. It is a document that will help drive the DAO, protocol, token, and ecosystem into the foreseeable future and directly inform decisions surrounding new proposals and initiatives.\n\n## Diving In\n\n### Purpose (Meaning): Defend and guide the Arbitrum Ecosystem. \n\nDriving Question: Why does Arbitrum DAO exist?\n\n* Why is Arbitrum DAO developing all of the products and initiatives with the design decisions it is?\n\nAnswer: Arbitrum DAO’s purpose is to **Defend and guide the Arbitrum Ecosystem.**\n\nArbitrum is not just scaling tech, it scales L1s without concessions to censorship resistance, accessibility, decentralization, or security. A crucial component of the DAO’s existence is to defend these ideals. For its governed chains, Arbitrum DAO ensures that there is no single point of control, can eliminate rent-seeking intermediaries, and most importantly, users maintain control of their assets without trusting an entity. In order to defend Arbitrum into perpetuity, the DAO requires sustainable operations and funding mechanisms, which will be further expanded on in the Vision section below. \n\nAccording to the [blockchain trilemma](https://ethereum.org/en/roadmap/vision/), to scale and accommodate more throughput and users, L1s require trade-offs in terms of either security or decentralization. Making concessions to decentralization or security is not an option for Ethereum mainnet, leading to a chain that even with today’s limited number of onchain participants becomes prohibitively expensive for most users. Arbitrum DAO’s purpose, true to Vitalik’s [rollup-centric roadmap](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/a-rollup-centric-ethereum-roadmap/4698), is to scale L1s while defending security and decentralization. \n\nThe second portion of Arbitrum DAO’s purpose is to guide the ecosystem. Guiding the Arbitrum ecosystem refers to every aspect of what Arbitrum offers, whether it be Arbitrum One, Orbit’s ecosystem of chains, or DAO-funded programs. At a high level, guiding encompasses two areas: growing and stewarding. Growing Arbitrum One is achieved by creating the best environment for builders, supporting their apps, bringing in more users and awareness to the value One provides, and ensuring alignment between builders and Arbitrum DAO. The same applies to Arbitrum’s Orbit chains. Sustainable growth is at the core of Arbitrum DAO’s purpose, and the DAO should view its role with respect to growth from a lens of continuing for 100s if not 1000s of years.\n\nStewarding the ecosystem relies on guiding the path forward for Arbitrum upgrades, new products, and funding decisions. In the world of Arbitrum, the DAO is in control, and that means making informed decisions that optimally move the ecosystem forward in an unceasing and durable way. The DAO is in charge of calling the shots for the future of Arbitrum. \n\n### Mission (Action): Empower people with the freedom to build their best onchain world.\n\nDriving Question: What is Arbitrum DAO doing to achieve its purpose?\n\n* What activities is it executing in practice that lead to its reason for existence being achieved?\n\nAnswer: Arbitrum DAO’s mission is to **Empower people with the freedom to build their best onchain world.**\n\nArbitrum DAO’s mission is to empower people with the sovereignty to build what they want, code in their preferred language, execute without barriers, and create without needing permission—embracing true onchain freedom. However, building one's best onchain world does not just apply to developers, but equally to users, creators, and DAO contributors.\n\nArbitrum gives builders the freedom to develop on their own terms. “Your chain, Your rules.” This includes, among other things, allowing for self-governed rollups (not forcing ARB into the design) and supporting multiple languages. Arbitrum stands out in being the best and most robust scaling tech, but also in forward-thinking design decisions that enable it to be the primary home for builders by giving freedom and flexibility to its development community.\n\nThe most important aspect of enabling the best onchain world is achieved through Arbitrum continuing to build a full-featured tech stack that includes battle-tested permissionless proving, forced inclusion, custom gas tokens, multi-language support, interoperability, MEV solutions, and much more. True to its purpose, the best onchain world with Arbitrum has security at its core.\n\nEmpowering rollup and application developers to leverage the best-in-class technology stack without restrictions will establish network effects and, importantly, a unified narrative that ties together the rest of the ecosystem, creating an environment that attracts new builders across a wide set of verticals to Arbitrum. This in turn enables Arbitrum to be the primary destination for compelling blockspace, defined as a blockchain’s ability to attract users through the utility it provides. For a rollup to be compelling, it must have sought-after blockspace, which can only be achieved in one way: Attracting great apps. We don't just aim to create blockspace that maintains Ethereum's core values, we aim to create blockspace that people want to use. Attracting builders is one of the most crucial pieces to Arbitrum’s mission. While crypto has many amazing apps, compelling blockspace is the key that will enable crypto to break into magnitudes more users in the future. Today, Arbitrum One is the most compelling rollup in crypto and the DAO’s flagship product, and that is an achievement we must continue to support at all costs. That said we must not lose sight that on a long time horizon, the ecosystem will also expand through complimentary Orbit chains.\n\nWhen it comes to end-users, creators, and DAO contributors, Arbitrum DAO’s mission to empower people with freedom can be quantified in two notable ways:\n1. Being part of a wider, resonating collective movement generates a certain degree of loyalty, excitement, and alignment that is difficult to quantify, yet crucial in driving long-term, sustained engagement and new contributions.\n2. Freedom is attributed to the ability to pick and choose from a wide selection of applications and infrastructure-level solutions, creating a package of services tailored to specific requirements. Arbitrum offers flexibility to meet diverse priorities and utility functions—whether users value security, privacy, low costs, etc., the ecosystem adapts to support them all. Arbitrum is building to be the one-stop shop where end users, creators, and DAO contributors are equipped to effortlessly perform anything that’s achievable on a blockchain without constraints.\n\nIn order to reach the aforementioned goals, it is of the utmost importance that Arbitrum DAO runs sustainable operations with revenue. Without sustainability, it will be impossible for the DAO to continue supporting the building out of the best scaling tech, pushing forward an ecosystem attracting the best builders, and providing end users, creators, and DAO contributors with an empowering, collaborative, and personalized environment. A pivotal part of Arbitrum DAO’s mission is ensuring that all highly adopted Arbitrum-based rollups and apps create revenue for the DAO, maintaining alignment between the ecosystem and token.\n\n### Vision (Aspiration): Arbitrum is home to the universal shift onchain.\n\nDriving Question: What is the end state goal for Arbitrum that the DAO is striving to achieve?\n\n* Where is Arbitrum’s place in the world after the DAO achieves all it has set out to do?\n\nAnswer: **Arbitrum is home to the universal shift onchain.**\n\nWith the most full-featured tech stack and compelling (sought-after) blockspace in crypto on Arbitrum stack rollups, users and builders from all walks of life and verticals will have flocked into the Arbitrum ecosystem. New users’ first onboarding experience in crypto will be through an Arbitrum rollup, while the default choice for developers will be to deploy on an Arbitrum technology stack-enabled chain. In a world where financial transactions happen onchain, the majority will take place on Arbitrum blockspace.\n\nArbitrum DAO will function as a resilient flywheel. The best tech stack together with robust ecosystem support will increasingly attract builders and notable enterprises who create and enable applications that onboard more users into the ecosystem. Profits accruing to the DAO from users leveraging Arbitrum’s blockspace will bolster network security and also be reinvested in a sustainable and diversified manner. Sequencing and licensing fees will be reinforced by acquiring ownership interests that help expand the ecosystem (intangible) and enable value accrual (tangible). The DAO will function with some similarities to a conglomerate, leveraging investments to create an even more robust application and infrastructure layer, directly strengthening its core product, which again will produce increasing returns that can be used to strengthen network security through ARB and to support new growth.\n\n![MVP Image 3.jpeg](ipfs://bafybeie47gxhymgnzlpwh5p7v24s6fhwlbc3ai3dff7jcbykkadfn2jema)\n## Concluding Thoughts\n\nIt took multiple months of conversations with stakeholders to really get a sense of Arbitrum DAO’s future but Entropy Advisors is very happy with the potential for this new process. While much of this proposal is not directly actionable, we believe that it is the necessary first step in moving forward with Arbitrum DAO’s future strategic plans. We look forward to making final modifications to the MVP based on the DAO’s feedback. It is worth noting that it is not possible for the MVP to serve everyone's desires because it would end up with contradictions, but it’s important that it is a document that the DAO can get behind and feel empowered to use.\n\nThe subsequent SOS (Strategic Objective Setting) proposal will be the next step in this exercise, in which anyone will be able to create 12- and 24-month actionable strategic goals for the DAO. The SOS will be posted shortly after the MVP. If approved, it will include a 14-day notice period and 30-day submission window, in which any contributor can submit a strategy matrix of concrete strategic objectives aligned with the MVP. These workstreams could then be budgeted, creating a new paradigm for operational structure in the DAO.\n\n## Expected Timeline\n\n1. Dec 9th: final version of MVP forum period requesting comments and time to edit the proposal with delegate/broader community suggestions. Will be extended if necessary.\n3. Dec 12th: Snapshot to signal approval/disapproval/abstention of MVP (simple majority with at least 3% of all votable tokens voting either “For” or “Abstain”).\n4. Late Dec / Early Jan: SOS posted\n5. Entropy Advisors plans to take the MVP to a constitutional vote, adding it as language to the constitution, after a 6-month trial period. During the initial 6 months, changes can be made to the MVP via a proposal+Snapshot vote, but after being included in the constitution, would require a constitutional onchain amendment. It is our belief that the current MVP is broad enough to handle substantial changes in the crypto market.\n\nA huge thank you to @castlecapital, @maxlomu, and all the other contributors who dedicated considerable time and effort to provide us with valuable feedback on this exercise.",
