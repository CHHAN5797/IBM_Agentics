Rehype Pools build on top of the E-CLP's asymmetric concentrated liquidity profile, improving capital efficiency on two fronts. As per previous arrangements between Balancer and Gnosis this pool shall not bear any protocol fees for the time being.\n\n### References/Useful links\n* [Documentation of Rehype Pools](https://docs.gyro.finance/gyroscope-protocol/concentrated-liquidity-pools/rehype-e-clps)\n* [Website](https://gyro.finance/)\n* [Github](https://github.com/gyrostable)\n* [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/2vnqnS7wE6)\n* [X](https://twitter.com/GyroStable)\n\n---\n\n### Protocol description\n* \"Savings Dai (sDAI) is a tokenized representation of Dai deposited in the Dai Savings Rate (DSR) offered by MakerDAO. The sDAI token enables users to receive returns on their DSR deposits while still being able to transfer, stake, lend and use it in any way they want.\" - [Spark](https://docs.spark.fi/defi-infrastructure/sdai-overview)\n* aUSDC is the deposit receipt token issued by the [Aave](https://aave.com/) protocol to lenders of USDC. Since aTokens are rebasing, this pool uses BGD Labs's [statA wrapper](https://github.com/bgd-labs/static-a-token-v3) that is a repricing representation of statA tokens that reflects the accruing lending yield.\n\n---\n\n### Motivation\nGyroscope is expanding to Gnosis Chain.\n\n---\n\n### Specifications\n#### Governance\nThe Gyroscope Protocol will be governed by a DAO and relevant stakeholder with the full launch on Ethereum. For now, the FTL Labs multi-sig can pause the pool, change the swap fee and set the protocol fee. As a custom pool by Gyroscope, the E-CLP will be controlled by Gyroscope governance upon its launch.\n\n #### Oracles\n n/a\n\n#### Audits\nAudit reports by Nethermind, Trail of Bits, and Runtime Verification can be accessed here (the E-CLP is called the “CEMM” in these reports). In addition, the E-CLP code has been live in production on Polygon since November 2022.\n\n#### Centralization vectors\nNo centralization vectors. The FTL Labs team’s multi-sig can - currently - pause the pool, change the swap fee and set the protocol fee.\n\n#### Market History\nThe Gyroscope Protocol is live on Ethereum since EOY23, with E-CLPs on several other chains.

        "body": "### PR with Payload\nhttps://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/853\n\n> # Summary\n> * This is a proposal to enable one uncapped Balancer gauge for stataArbUSDT/stataArbUSDCn on Arbitrum.\n> * The underlying pool is a Rehype Pool, an extension of Gyroscope's E-CLPs. Rehype Pools auto-rehypothecate E-CLP assets to Aave and can thus accrue yield from three different sources: (1) Aave lending deposit yield, (2) swap yields from asymmetric concentrated liquidity, and (3) yield from third-party token incentive markets.\n> * The pool shall have a swap fee of 0.5 basis points, i.e., 0.005% at pool inception. A protocol fee of 30% will be set upon incentives going live. This may be changed later upon mutual discussion (this is a new Rehype pool type and fees and growth may need to be fine tuned). At pool inception, no fees will go towards Gyroscope.\n\n> # References/Useful links\n> * [Documentation of Rehype pools](https://docs.gyro.finance/gyroscope-protocol/concentrated-liquidity-pools/rehype-e-clps#description-of-rehype-e-clps)\n> * [Website](https://gyro.finance/)\n> * [Github](https://github.com/gyrostable)\n> * [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/2vnqnS7wE6)\n> * [X](https://twitter.com/GyroStable)\n\n> # Protocol description\n>\n>* stataArbUSDT is the wrapped, static version of the rebasing Aave lending deposit token for aUSDT on Arbitrum. - [Aave](https://github.com/bgd-labs/static-a-token-v3)\n> * stataArbUSDCn is the wrapped, static version of the rebasing Aave lending deposit token for aUSDC on Arbitrum. - [Aave](https://github.com/bgd-labs/static-a-token-v3)\n\n> # Motivation\n>\n> Rehype pools reach new efficiency heights while staying simple and therefore safer. Rehype pools embrace a simple, modular design that doesn't introduce new smart contract code for rehypothecation. Rehype pools thus inherit the security record of E-CLPs.\n> The complexity of Rehype pools is handled in the more flexible layers of order routing and front end interface instead of in smart contracts.\nAt the same time, they keep everything transparent on-chain and keep users in control, in contrast to common rehypothecation in TradFi.\n\n> # Specifications\n> > ## Governance\n> > The Gyroscope Protocol will be governed by a DAO and relevant stakeholder with the full launch on Ethereum. For now, the FTL Labs multi-sig can pause the pool, change the swap fee and set the protocol fee. As a custom pool by Gyroscope, the E-CLP will be controlled by Gyroscope governance upon its launch.\n> > ## Oracles\n> > * rateProvider0 (for stataArbUSDCn): [0x87cD462A781c0ca843EAB131Bf368328848bB6fD](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x87cD462A781c0ca843EAB131Bf368328848bB6fD#readContract)\n> > * rateProvider1 (for stataArbUSDT): [0x48942B49B5bB6f3E1d43c204a3F40a4c5F696ef6](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x48942B49B5bB6f3E1d43c204a3F40a4c5F696ef6#code)\n> > * (allows to control for a price drift from accruing yield by using rate providers to first convert from yield accruing tokens to the underlying)\n> > * Reviews for these rate providers can be verified as SAFE [here](https://github.com/balancer/code-review/pull/34/files#diff-5861d38cee7220a0b2672cd05e4233e4058bdc3c7c0d4aa1f7a5e00979bfee8b). \n>>\n> > ## Audits\n> > Audit reports by Nethermind, Trail of Bits, and Runtime Verification for the underlying E-CLP can be accessed here (the E-CLP is called the “CEMM” in these reports). In addition, the E-CLP code has been live in production on Polygon since November 2022. 'Rehype Pools' are an extension of E-CLP that supports Aave's statA tokens and outsources much of the complexity of 'Boosted Pools' to order routers.\n> > ## Centralization vectors\n> > No centralization vectors. The FTL Labs team’s multi-sig can - currently - pause the pool, change the swap fee and set the protocol fee.\n> > ## Market History\n> > The Gyroscope Protocol is live on Ethereum since EOY23, with E-CLPs on several other chains.
