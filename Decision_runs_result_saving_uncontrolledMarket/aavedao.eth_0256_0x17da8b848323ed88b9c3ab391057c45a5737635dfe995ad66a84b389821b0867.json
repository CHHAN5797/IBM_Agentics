This service aims to further decentralize the protocol's staking exposure and actively participate in network security. ACI will operate staking nodes and run validator nodes on behalf of the DAO, enhancing the DAO's passive income and promoting a diversified staking strategy.\n\n## Motivation\n\nTransitioning from simply acquiring Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs) like stETH and rETH to actively running validator nodes, \"Frontier\" represents a significant step towards greater involvement in Ethereum's network decentralization and security. \n\nFor this trial experiment, we propose to run 32 Stader minipools of 4 ETH.\n\nThis proactive approach will allow the Aave DAO to host community members in our minipools, providing them with staking exposure through ETHx.\n\n## Specification\n\nTo initiate \"Frontier,\" we propose the creation of a 2/3 multisig controlled by:\n\n- Aci.eth\n- Tokenlogic\n- Karpatkey\n\nThis multisig will be funded with 128 wETH, enabling ACI to set up 32 validator minipools on behalf of the Aave DAO.\n\n**Benefits:**\n\n- **Enhanced diversity**: The Aave DAO has been a pioneer in LST diversity, staking as a service can allow the DAO to increase this diversity with new ecosystems and assets that are not necessary onboarded on main pools yet.\n- **Increased alignment**: Most DAO in our ecosystem to generate a passive income on their ETH holdings acquire stETH and call it a day. The Aave DAO was the first to actually push for diversity by adding exposure to rETH.\n\nThis ARFC proposes to take our ETH-alignment a step further by being the first ever DAO actually to run nodes. by operating minipools, the DAO reinforce its synergies with other protocols such as stader, and directly increases these LST alternative market shares by allowing passive investors to acquire ETHx (1 wETH stake by the DAO allows for 3 ETH to be “staked\" via ETHx)\n\nThe Aave DAO always pioneered and led, and we hope to inspire in the ecosystem; this is why this new service is named “Frontier.” (also as a reference to Ethereum's early days).\n\n**Guarantees and Risk Mitigation:**\n\n- **Yield Guarantee:** ACI will ensure a consistent yield, equivalent to the 'regular' ETHx returns, regardless of the actual performance of the nodes. mitigating Aave DAO performance risk.\n\nFrom experience, while Yield is consistent over infinite timeframes and/or deposits, DAOs and humans have the bad habit of not having infinite time and money.\n\n“Solo staking” or “minipool staking” are needed for decentralization, but when placed on the wrong side of variance, it can lead to underwhelming returns. As Frontier grows overtime this effect will be smoothen out, until then, ACI is confident in managing financial risk, even when luck isn't on our side. We are aligned and focused on long-term outcomes.\n\n- **Slashing Protection:** ACI commits to covering any potential losses due to slashing, safeguarding the Aave DAO's wETH funds.\n- **Stader SD Token Provision:** In partnership with Stader, ACI will obtain the necessary SD tokens, enabling the DAO to engage in staking without direct exposure to the SD asset.\n\nThis will remove all need for directional exposure to the SD token for the Aave DAO. The ACI will use related rewards to participate in Stader governance aligned with its “meta-governance” mission.\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. If Snapshot Stage outcome is YAE, to mitigate governance burden, and reduce the amount of governance AIP, Aave Finance will be requested to include the staking multisig funding in their next treasury management AIP.\n2. Implement \"Frontier\" by setting up the validator minipools\n\n## Disclosure\n\nThe ACI, independently initiates \"Frontier\" without external compensation.\nIf Frontier is approved, The ACI will receive the necessary SD tokens to operate Pools from Stader.\nThe ACI already operates Ethereum validators, Rocketpool, & stader Minipools privately.\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived under [Creative Commons Zero (CC0)](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

This compensation allows them to focus on aave and keep their contribution efforts to our governance. The ACI proposes the extension of Orbit for a new quarter.\n\nWith the transition to Governance V3, a significant feature introduced is gasless voting via Gelato integration on the [DAO-run governance app](https://vote.onaave.com), making it easier for delegates to participate without the burden of gas costs. This innovation prompts the proposal to discontinue the general gas rebate program. However, recognizing the continued necessity for proposal creation and payload deployment activities, we propose maintaining targeted gas rebates for these specific actions.\n\n## Specification\n\n* **Period Coverage:** Blocks 19162697 (5th Feb 2024) to Block 19860031 (May 13th 2024)\n* **Eligible Platforms:**\n\t+ EzR3al\n\t+ Stable Labs\n\t+ Saucy Block\n\t+ Areta\n* **Gas Rebate:** Since this period is entirely covered by Governance V3, the Orbit program does not reimburse delegate vote gas as their vote is now subsidized by Gelato. We will continue to reimburse Service Providers for their Governance-related activity:\n\n   + ACI : 2.74 ETH\n   + TokenLogic : 0.641 ETH\n\n* **Budget:** 60000 GHO and 3.381 ETH\n* **Relevant Links:**\n\t+ [Script output](https://aavechan.notion.site/Gov-V3-May-2024-Script-Output-af8acc9d53874444b9a576e2329da28a)\n+ [ACI's Orbit tracker](https://apps.aavechan.com/orbit-tracker)\n\n\n## Next Steps\n1. Gather community feedback on this ARFC.\n2. If consensus is achieved, move this proposal to the ARFC snapshot stage.\n3. If the ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, proceed to the AIP stage for implementation and funding allocation in cooperation with Aave Finance service providers via an ad-hoc AIP vote or bundled in one of their treasury management AIPs.\n\n## Disclosure\nThe Aave Chan Initiative is independent and has not received any form of compensation from related parties for the drafting of this proposal.\n\n## Copyright\nCopyright and related rights waived under [Creative Commons Zero (CC0)](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

Compensating them with GHO and ETH reimbursement of Gas costs associated with their governance activity.\n\n## Motivation\n\nWith the transition to Governance V3, a significant feature introduced is gasless voting via Gelato integration on the [DAO-run governance app](https://vote.onaave.com), making it easier for delegates to participate without the burden of gas costs.\n\nThis innovation prompts the proposal to discontinue the general gas rebate program, However, recognizing the continued necessity for proposal creation and payload deployment activities, the proposal suggests maintaining targeted gas rebates for these specific actions. These tasks are now streamlined under the ACI's Dolce Vita product, offering a focused and efficient mechanism to manage and reimburse the gas expenditures associated with governance contributions.\n\nTo accurately track and reimburse gas expenditures, the proposal leverages [open-source scripts](https://github.com/JosepBove/aave-gov-gas) initially developed by Josep Bove, now part of the ACI team. These scripts have been [adapted for compatibility with Governance V3](https://github.com/AaveChan/aave-gov3-gas/tree/master), ensuring transparency and accountability in monitoring gas costs incurred by delegates during their governance activities.\n\nMoreover, the proposal introduces the [Orbit Tracker app](https://www.aavechan.com/orbit-tracker), which was developed by Martin, a new front-end engineer at ACI. This tool provides a comprehensive overview of recognized delegates, detailing their voting power and participation rates, thus enhancing the visibility of delegate contributions and engagement within the Aave ecosystem.\n\n \n![image](ipfs://bafybeidaq56t2akvacel6xwg6kasz3ktw3f7lck3ysvn7xodfxbpnp5wju)\n    \n\nThe eligibility criteria for Orbit renewal emphasize participation rate, power, and platform maturity, ensuring that only the most dedicated and impactful delegates are compensated. These criteria are designed to balance the quality of governance participation with the cost-effectiveness of the Orbit program.\n\nTo define eligibility for renewal of Orbit, we propose the following requirements:\n\n- Not an Aave Service Provider\n- Minimum 20k voting power\n- Minimum 70% participation rate\n- Minimum 120 days since delegate platform creation\n\nThe following table outlines the proposed compensation for eligible delegates matching the requirements:\n\n|Delegate Platform|Retro-Payment (GHO)|New Stream (GHO)|Total Cost (GHO)|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|EzR3al|5000|15000|20000|\n|Stable Labs|5000|15000|20000|\n|LBS Blockchain|5000|15000|20000|\n|Michigan|5000|15000|20000|\n|Total|20000|60000|80000|\n\nIn terms of gas rebate, we included Gov V2 reimbursement & payload-related activity in the following table:\n\n|Delegate / Service Provider | Gas Used (ETH)|\n|--- | ---|\n|ACI | 3.365|\n|Tokenlogic | 0.586|\n|Michigan | 0.276|\n|Wintermute | 0.2518|\n|LBS | 0.031|\n|StableLabs | 0.0342|\n|ezr3al | 0.3833|\n|**Total** | **4.9273**|\n\n### Relevant Links\n\n - [Orbit tracker app](https://www.aavechan.com/orbit-tracker) \n - Gov V2 [script output](https://aavechan.notion.site/Gov-V2-Gas-rebate-Feb-2024-Script-output-e7df604934434435849f71b4105a9d43?pvs=4)\n- Gov V3 [script output](https://www.notion.so/aavechan/Gov-V3-Payload-Script-output-cee4e7ce8b7048b58ec874a4b1499aa3)\n- Gov V2 [script code](https://github.com/JosepBove/aave-gov-gas)\n- Gov V3 [script code](https://github.com/AaveChan/aave-gov3-gas/tree/master)\n\n\n\n\n## Specification\n\n- **Period Coverage:** Blocks 18040579 (Sep 1st 2023) to 19162696 (5th feb 2024)\n- **Eligibility Criteria:** Non-Aave Service Providers, minimum 20k voting power, 70% participation rate, and 120 days since platform creation.\n- **Budget:** 80000 GHO and 4.6755 ETH\n\n## Next Steps\n1. Gather community feedback on this ARFC.\n2. If consensus is achieved, move this proposal to the ARFC snapshot stage.\n3. If the ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, proceed to the AIP stage for implementation and funding allocation in cooperation with Aave Finance service providers via an ad-hoc AIP vote or bundled in one of their treasury managements AIPs.\n\n## Disclosure\nThe Aave Chan Initiative is independent and has not received any form of compensation from related parties for the drafting of this proposal.\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived under [Creative Commons Zero (CC0)](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

        "body": "---\nTitle: [ARFC] Add Contango Protocol, Cian Protocol and Index Coop to flashBorrowers on Aave V3\nAuthor: Aave Chan Initiative (ACI)\nDated: 2024-01-31\n\n## Summary\nThe following proposal plans to add Contango, Cian Protocol and Index Coop as whitelisted actors of the Flashborrowers of Aave V3 on Ethereum, Arbitrum, and Optimism liquidity pools.\n\n## Motivation\n\n[Contango Protocol](https://app.contango.xyz/) is a Dapp that builds perps by automating looping strategies, through Flash Loans. When a trader opens a position, the protocol borrows on the money market, swaps on the spot market, then lends back on the money market, allowing users to actively manage and take leveraged positions on Aave and other protocols.\n\n[Cian Protocol](https://cian.app/] is a decentralized automation platform that helps users onboard complex crypto delta-neutral yield strategies in one simple transaction.\n\n[Index Coop](https://indexcoop.com/)is an EVM based protocol that enables easy access to complex DeFi strategies by translating them into ERC20 tokens.\n\nIf this proposal is implemented, all flashLoan fees for Contango Protocol, Cian Protocol and Index Coop users using Aave would be waived.\n\nThe Aave-Chan initiative believes that any incurred lost potential revenue will be compensated by the increased competitiveness of the Aave Protocol and the increased borrow volume.\n\nCurrently, every flashloan has a 9 bps fee that rewards liquidity providers in Aave. While flashloans were created by Aave, the ecosystem as a whole has replicated this feature, and most protocols do not implement any fees.\n\nThe ACI does not support waiving the fees for flashloans in general, as we firmly believe that users’ funds used, even in the context of a single transaction, should be rewarded.\n\nHowever, some strategic use cases of V3, such as emode, are very fee-sensitive as they mobilize high leverage. Waiving the Contango Protocol, Cian Protocol and Index Coop flashloan fees is expected to make these strategies more convenient and profitable, leading to increased borrow volume and thus increased Aave DAO revenue.\n\n## Implementation\nWhitelist Contango Protocol, Cian Protocol and Index Coop as part of FlashBorrowers of Aave V3 on Ethereum, Arbitrum & Optimism liquidity pools.\n\nThis proposal aims to implement a single AIP, utilizing three similar payloads (one for each network), which will call addFlashBorrower() on the ACL_MANAGER contract.\n\nThis AIP grants permission to whitelist any Contango Protocol, Cian Protocol and Index Coop contract for all use cases, such as leveraged positions, EMODE, debt and collateral swaps, with one exception: no smart-contract that migrates a position outside of the Aave ecosystem is eligible for whitelisting.\n\n## Useful links\n\n - [Contango Protocol](https://app.contango.xyz/)\n- [Cian Protocol](https://cian.app/)\n- [Index Coop](https://indexcoop.com/)\n- [Developers Documentation](https://docs.aave.com/developers/guides/flash-loans)\n\n\n## Next Steps:\nCollect community feedback on this ARFC\nEscalate this proposal to Snapshot vote\nIf Snapshot vote outcome is YAE, Escalate to AIP vote.\n\n## Disclaimer\nThe Aave-Chan Initiative (ACI) is not associated with or compensated by Contango Protocol, Cian Protocol or Index Coop for publishing this AFRC.\n\n## Copyright\nCopyright and related rights waived under Creative Commons Zero (CC0).",

As productive assets, LSTs are high quality collateral to borrow against. Given their high correlation to ETH, LSTs are commonly used as collateral to borrow ETH and engage in yield leveraged staking, with several communities having built products that automate such strategies on top of Aave. The introduction of eMode only made such strategies more popular.\n\nosETH in particular is overcollateralized by design, providing in-built slashing protection and consequently an increased level of protection for the Aave protocol…\n\nAs StakeWise V3 provides solo stakers to ability to mint osETH against their own nodes, on-boarding osETH will benefit Aave, StakeWise, and the Ethereum ecosystem as a whole, and be an important step in the pursuit to diversify Ethereum staking and encourage staking from home.\n\nThe onboarding of osETH will consequently create increased osETH demand and increased revenues for both Aave and StakeWise protocols, whilst also bolstering the liquidity and peg stability of osETH.\n\n## Chain to be deployed/listed\n\nEthereum mainnet\n\n## Specification:\n\nosETH contract address:\n\n[0xf1C9acDc66974dFB6dEcB12aA385b9cD01190E38](https://etherscan.io/address/0xf1C9acDc66974dFB6dEcB12aA385b9cD01190E38)\n\n| Risk Parameter | Value |\n| --- | --- |\n| Emode | No |\n| Isolation Mode | No |\n| Borrowable in Isolation | No |\n| Stable Borrow | No |\n| Enable Borrow | Yes |\n| Enable Collateral | Yes |\n| Loan To Value (LTV) | 71% |\n| Liquidation Threshold | 76% |\n| Liquidation Bonus | 10% |\n| Reserve Factor | 15% |\n| Liquidation Protocol Fee | 10% |\n| Supply Cap | 15000 osETH |\n| Borrow Cap | 1000 osETH |\n| Debt Ceiling | N/A |\n| uOptimal | 45% |\n| Base | 0% |\n| Slope1 | 7% |\n| Slope2 | 300% |\n\n## Useful Links\n\n[TEMP CHECK](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-onboard-oseth-to-aave-v3-on-ethereum-pool/15636)\n\n[Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0xef2124e2d2e756649f133338c2a876f61be19b7a5ace7df58326f1df034c6d5d)\n\n[Website](https://www.stakewise.io/)\n\n[V3Litepaper](https://www.stakewise.io/stakewise-v3.pdf)\n\n[Audits](https://github.com/stakewise/v3-core/tree/main/audits)\n\n[Github](https://github.com/stakewise/v3-core)\n\n[Twitter](https://twitter.com/stakewise_io)\n[Discord](https://discord.com/invite/StakeWise)\n[Forum](https://forum.stakewise.io/)\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThe Aave-chan Initiative is not presenting this ARFC on behalf of any third party and is not compensated by Stakewise for creating this proposal.\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. Collect community & service providers feedback before escalating proposal to ARFC snapshot stage\n2. If consensus is reached on this ARFC escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n3. If the Snapshot outcome is YAE, this proposal will be escalated to AIP stage\n4. If the ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, publish an AIP vote for final confirmation and enforcement of the proposal\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived under [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",
