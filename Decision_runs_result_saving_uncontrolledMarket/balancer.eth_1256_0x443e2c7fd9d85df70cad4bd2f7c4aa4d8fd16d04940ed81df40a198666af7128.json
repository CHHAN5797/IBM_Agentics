The specific pools affected are the [rETH/wETH](https://app.balancer.fi/#/arbitrum/pool/0xade4a71bb62bec25154cfc7e6ff49a513b491e81000000000000000000000497), [sfrxETH/rETH/wstETH](https://app.balancer.fi/#/arbitrum/pool/0x0c8972437a38b389ec83d1e666b69b8a4fcf8bfd00000000000000000000049e), and [cbETH/rETH/wstETH](https://app.balancer.fi/#/arbitrum/pool/0x4a2f6ae7f3e5d715689530873ec35593dc28951b000000000000000000000481) pools, all of which currently utilize the same rate provider. This would be done by killing the gauges of the current pools 6 weeks from the execution of this proposal, and adding the new gauges of the following pools to the controller as soon as possible.\n\n[rETH/wETH](https://app.balancer.fi/#/arbitrum/pool/0xd0ec47c54ca5e20aaae4616c25c825c7f48d40690000000000000000000004ef): 0xd0ec47c54ca5e20aaae4616c25c825c7f48d4069\n\nChild Gauge:[ 0x8ba2D53F34159C5C5e7add60B56C7dE3BBc1DA68](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x8ba2D53F34159C5C5e7add60B56C7dE3BBc1DA68#readContract)\n\nRoot Gauge:[ 0xf8A95653CC7ee59AfA2304DcC518c431a15C292C](https://etherscan.io/address/0xf8A95653CC7ee59AfA2304DcC518c431a15C292C)\n\n[sfrxETH/wstETH](https://app.balancer.fi/#/arbitrum/pool/0xc2598280bfea1fe18dfcabd21c7165c40c6859d30000000000000000000004f3): 0xc2598280bfea1fe18dfcabd21c7165c40c6859d3\n\nChild Gauge:[ 0x06eaf7bAabEac962301eE21296e711B3052F2c0d](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x06eaf7bAabEac962301eE21296e711B3052F2c0d)\n\nRoot Gauge:[ 0xEaF1eef5814D9be44D0dBFb54c7773844339B7F8](https://etherscan.io/address/0xEaF1eef5814D9be44D0dBFb54c7773844339B7F8#code)\n\n[cbETH/rETH/wstETH](https://app.balancer.fi/#/arbitrum/pool/0x2d6ced12420a9af5a83765a8c48be2afcd1a8feb000000000000000000000500): 0x2d6ced12420a9af5a83765a8c48be2afcd1a8feb\n\nChild Gauge:[ 0x5a0e92a55800BB5bFd5ec6C7340BfdE7f0947c3E](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x5a0e92a55800BB5bFd5ec6C7340BfdE7f0947c3E#code)\n\nRoot Gauge:[ 0xBE0967E7510604302b0F974E21A625D9f762B8bb](https://etherscan.io/address/0xBE0967E7510604302b0F974E21A625D9f762B8bb#code)\n\nThe core pool recycled fees generated by the 3 pools which will have their gauges killed in 6 weeks will be directed to the new pool gauges effective upon the new gauges being added to the controller, This is to slowly move the incentives over giving LP’s ample time to move into the new pools with as little friction as possible.\n\n**Motivation:**\n\nThe migration is scheduled on this timeline to enhance the experience for liquidity providers. The migration’s root cause is due to a low severity issue with the current [rate provider](https://arbiscan.io/address/0xa73ec45fe405b5bfcdc0bf4cbc9014bb32a01cd2) that rETH is utilizing only on the Arbitrum network. The concern is the rate reverting to a value from a slightly earlier date. This is currently being mitigated by the rocket pool team and will be monitored by both teams. The expectation is this will be a non-issue until after monitoring is concluded, which will occur after the migration window. The new pools utilize the [new rETH rate provider ](https://arbiscan.io/address/0xd4e96ef8eee8678dbff4d535e033ed1a4f7605b7)addressing any relevant concerns.\n\n**Technical Specification:**\n\nGauge Adds:\n\nTransaction: The Balancer Maxi LM Multisig eth:0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860 will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at 0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd and call the addGauge function with the following arguments:\n\ngauge(address): 0xf8A95653CC7ee59AfA2304DcC518c431a15C292C\n\ngaugeType(string): `Arbitrum`\n\ngauge(address): 0xEaF1eef5814D9be44D0dBFb54c7773844339B7F8\n\ngaugeType(string): `Arbitrum`\n\ngauge(address): 0xBE0967E7510604302b0F974E21A625D9f762B8bb\n\ngaugeType(string): `Arbitrum`\n\nGauge Kills:\n\nThe DAO Multisig 0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f will interact with the AuthorizerAdaptorEntrypoint at 0xf5dECDB1f3d1ee384908Fbe16D2F0348AE43a9eA and call performAction using 0xab8f0945 for the data(bytes) argument and the “Root Gauge Addresses” list for each pool below will be used for the target(address) argument.\n\nRoot Gauge Adresses:\n\n[rETH/wETH](https://app.balancer.fi/#/arbitrum/pool/0xade4a71bb62bec25154cfc7e6ff49a513b491e81000000000000000000000497): 0x00b9bcd17cb049739d25fd7f826caa2e23b05620\n\n[sfrxETH/rETH/wstETH](https://app.balancer.fi/#/arbitrum/pool/0x0c8972437a38b389ec83d1e666b69b8a4fcf8bfd00000000000000000000049e): 0x49f530b45ae792cdf5cbd5d25c5a9b9e59c6c3b8\n\n[cbETH/rETH/wstETH](https://app.balancer.fi/#/arbitrum/pool/0x4a2f6ae7f3e5d715689530873ec35593dc28951b000000000000000000000481): 0x56c0626e6e3931af90ebb679a321225180d4b32b\n\nThe gauge kills will be executed at week number 14 (April 1st 2024 - April 7th 2024) assuming gauge adds are executed at week number 8 (February 19th 2024 - February 25th 2024)\n\nCore Pools Rerouting Configuration:\n\nThe currently empty [ core_pools_routing.json ](https://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/blob/main/config/core_pools_rerouting.json) will be changed to read as follows to reroute core pool incentives from the old rocket pools to the new one.\n```\n\n{\n\n“arbitrum”: {\n\n“0xade4a71bb62bec25154cfc7e6ff49a513b491e81000000000000000000000497”: ”0xd0ec47c54ca5e20aaae4616c25c825c7f48d40690000000000000000000004ef”, “\n\n“0x0c8972437a38b389ec83d1e666b69b8a4fcf8bfd00000000000000000000049e”: “0xc2598280bfea1fe18dfcabd21c7165c40c6859d30000000000000000000004f3”,\n\n“0x4a2f6ae7f3e5d715689530873ec35593dc28951b000000000000000000000481”: “0x2d6ced12420a9af5a83765a8c48be2afcd1a8feb000000000000000000000500”\n\n}\n\n}\n\n```",

The GoldenBoys are expanding to Arbitrum and getting ready to launch some products on mainnet. As many of the rules around caps have been created pertaining to me. I wanted to personally propose a suggestion that I think will be a general improvement for both Balancer and the Golden Boys.\n\nFirst, to mirror the implementation on Base, which has created necessary USDC/ETH and BAL liquidity on Base, we request the following 2 gauges on Arbitrum:\n\n[50GOLD/25USDC/25wstETH](https://app.balancer.fi/#/arbitrum/pool/0x2e8ea681fd59c9dc5f32b29de31f782724ef4dcb0001000000000000000004bc) - 6% cap\n\n[25GOLD/25BAL/25AURA/25wstETH] (https://app.balancer.fi/#/arbitrum/pool/0x49b2de7d214070893c038299a57bac5acb8b8a340001000000000000000004be) - 2% cap\n\nAs pools containing $GOLD are already receiving 12% of veBAL, and the tokens market cap does not warrant unlimited pools as per the gauge framework. I suggest the following compromises be made, which should increase the overall health of Balancer emissions.\n\n* Reduce cap on [50GOLD/25USDC/25ETH](https://app.balancer.fi/#/base/pool/0x433f09ca08623e48bac7128b7105de678e37d988000100000000000000000047) pool to 5%\n* I suggest that the 10% cap for Arbitrum Airdrop incentives be shared between the 2 pools.\n  * 8% cap on the 50/25/25 pool\n  * 2% cap on the 25/25/25/25 pool\n\nFurther as a show of good faith:\n\n* I will reduce voting on tetuBAL LP to < 15% of veBAL\n* I will reduce voting on BADGER LP to <5% of veBAL\n* I will work the Maxi’s to allocate 5% of my total veBAL towards pools that are beneficial to the ecosystem.\n\nUpon review of the current veBAL voting situation, you will see that this outcome moves in a positive direction.\n\n**References/Useful links:**\n\n> Website: humpysgold.eth.limo\n\nTwitter: @gold_on_chain\n\nDiscord: https://discord.com/invite/NK4EAUDDUc\n\nDocs: https://github.com/HumpysGold/\n\nCoingecko:\n\n**Protocol Description:**\n\nGOLD is an early, community-driven project that is nested within the Balancer ecosystem and founded by Humpy. Presently, GOLD benefits from Humpy’s large share of Balancer Governance and has created a mutually beneficial relationship on the Base network by bringing Balancer’s Base deployment healthy trading fees and needed USDC/WETH liquidity.\n\nWe have just received a good report on the audit of a new product we will release, an Aura Autocompounding Vault, which will offer the best rates to AURA holders (which indirectly supports the Balancer community), and use a healthy portion of protocol fees to buy and burn GOLD.\n\n**Motivation:**\n\nThe next major update to the GOLD ecosystem is the release of the GoldAURA Pounder. Aura is not on the Base network, and has focused their L2 presence on Arbitrum. Because the GoldAURA pounder will use protocol fees to buy and burn gold, this will be most efficient conducted on the Arbitrum (the L2 with Aura); furthermore, GOLD holders wish to earn Aura, which can be accomplished on Arbitrum.\n\nBy moving GOLD to Arbitrum and launching Balancer Gauges, we also have the opportunity to expand our community beyond people who are interested in the nascent Base network. New Golden Boys are often drawn to the project from outside the Balancer ecosystem. Attracting new community members to the GOLD project directly benefits Balancer as we raise awareness for the Balancer Ecosystem and provide new users for weighted liquidity pools and products like an Aura Pounder.\n\nMoving to Arbitrum allows us to form a tighter bond with Aura and expand the Golden Boys community to the much larger audience on Arbitrum, both of which have benefit to Balancer.\n\n**Specifications:**\n\n* Enable 50/25/25 - 6% cap\n* Enable 25/25/25/25 - 2% cap\n* Reduce Cap on 50/25/25 Base pool to 5%\n* Configure Arbitrum incentive caps for 50/25/25(8%) and 25/25/25/25(2%) pools in the airdrop program config.\n\n### Technical specification\nPart A: \nThe Balancer DAO Multisig `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` will interact with the Authorizer `0xA331D84eC860Bf466b4CdCcFb4aC09a1B43F3aE6` calling `grantRole` with the following arguments:\nrole: `0xae60dce27f51ce5815357b9f6b40f200557867f8222262a1646c005d09b7dfba`\nThis role corresponds to `setRelativeWeightCap(uint256)` on mainnet gauges and can be confirmed [here](https://github.com/balancer/balancer-v2-monorepo/blob/master/pkg/deployments/action-ids/mainnet/action-ids.json#L726). \n\nThe Balancer DAO Multisig `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` will interact with the AuthorizerAdaptorEntryPoint at `0xf5dECDB1f3d1ee384908Fbe16D2F0348AE43a9eA` and call performAction with\ntarget: `0xed0bb13496ce24EFFF8f9734A9707D092d4Be10c` being the GOLD/WETH/USDC root gauge and data `0x10d3eb0400000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000b1a2bc2ec50000` to set the cap to 5%\nThe Balancer DAO Multisig `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` will interact with the Authorizer `0xA331D84eC860Bf466b4CdCcFb4aC09a1B43F3aE6` calling `revokeRole` with the following arguments:\nrole: `0xae60dce27f51ce5815357b9f6b40f200557867f8222262a1646c005d09b7dfba`\naccount: `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` to revoke the previously assigned role to change gauge weights.\n\nPart B:\n\nThe Balancer Maxi LM Multisig eth:`0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd` and call the addGauge function with the following arguments:\n1. gauge(address):`0x86Cf58bD7A64f2304227d1a490660D2954dB4a91`\ngaugeType(string): `Arbitrum`\n\n2. gauge(address):`0xA8d4b31225BD6FAF1363DB5A0AB6c016894985d1`\ngaugeType(string): `Arbitrum`",

        "body": "### PR with Payload\nhttps://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/693\n\n**Summary:**\n> Balancer's core focus has been yield bearing liquidity for quite some time. As of recent [sDAI](https://app.spark.fi/sdai/) and [sFRAX](https://app.frax.finance/sfrax/stake) have become popular yield bearing stablecoins in the greater defi ecosystem. This proposal is meant to enable four gauges encompassing these tokens on Ethereum and Arbitrum in stable and weighted pools. The pool will sufficiently capture which captures the yield of these tokens and creates routing for the 3 primary stablecoins and wstETH to be swapped against. The pools all will be core for Balancer.\n\n**References/Useful links:**\n\n> Link to:\n    • [Maker Webiste](https://makerdao.com/en/)\n    • [Documentation](https://docs.makerdao.com/)\n    • [Github Page](https://github.com/makerdao/developerguides/blob/master/dai/dsr-manager-docs/dsr-manager-docs.md)    \n    • [Communities](https://forum.makerdao.com/)\n> Link to: \n    • [Frax Webiste](https://app.frax.finance/)\n    • [Documentation](https://docs.frax.finance/frax-v3/sfrax)\n    • [Github Page](https://github.com/FraxFinance/frax-solidity/blob/master/src/types/constants.ts)    \n    • [Communities](https://gov.frax.finance/)\n\n\n**Protocol Description:**\n\n> sDAI is part of the Maker ecosystem and utilizes the Dai Savings Rate to incentivize users to stake their DAI here https://app.spark.fi/sdai/ . \n>\n>sFRAX is from the new Frax v3 ecosystem and can be utilized [here](https://app.frax.finance/sfrax/stake). \n\n**Motivation:**\n\n> Balancer users will have a more capital efficient place to provide stable coin liquidity routes. As core pools these will receive BAL incentives over time via the BIP-19 cycle. sDAI and sFRAX will overall earn the DAO more revenue and strengthen the routing for swaps on Balancer using the underlying tokens.  \n\n**Specifications:**\n \n1. **Governance:** Maker DAO is a complex and robust Defi ecosystem. Their current governance module can be seen [here](https://docs.makerdao.com/smart-contract-modules/governance-module). Frax governance is outlined [here](https://docs.frax.finance/frax-governance/frax-governance-overview). \n\n2. **Oracles:** This pool relies on the [SavingsDAIRateProvider](https://0xc7177B6E18c1Abd725F5b75792e5F7A3bA5DBC2c) to account for the yield accrued by sDAI. This have been reviewed and deemed SAFE by the integrations team [here](https://github.com/threerocks-defi/code-review/blob/main/rate-providers/SavingsDAIRateProvider.md). The sFRAX and wstETH oracles utilize the Chainlink feed factory or have been proven by being utilized for over a year on the platform. \n\n3. **Audits:** MakerDAO audit reports can be seen [here](https://security.makerdao.com/audit-reports). Frax Finance Audits can be seen [here](https://docs.frax.finance/other/audits). \n\n4. **Centralization vectors:** Maker Governance is decentralized and has no apparent centralization vectors. The underlying stablecoins USDT, DAI, and USDC are also exposed to their own centralization risks.\n\n5. **Market History:** sDAI history can be seen on [coingecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/savings-dai). sFRAX history can be seen [here](https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/pools/0xfef79304c80a694dfd9e603d624567d470e1a0e7?utm_source=coingecko&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=searchresults). \n \n6. **Value:** Yield bearing assets increase the value proposition for liquidity providers, and the revenue for the DAO when properly configured. These pools will grow stablecoin and wstETH liquidity for Balancer, while tapping into the yield source of sDAI and sFRAX.\n\nsDAI/3Pool - Mainnet\nPool: [0x49cbD67651fbabCE12d1df18499896ec87BEf46f](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0x49cbd67651fbabce12d1df18499896ec87bef46f00000000000000000000064a)\nGauge: [0xF6A7ad46b00300344C7d4739C0518db70e722DC4](https://etherscan.io/address/0xF6A7ad46b00300344C7d4739C0518db70e722DC4)\n\nsDAI/wstETH - Mainnet\nPool: [0x6aa6d7542310cdc75d1179b8729e1e6ec8d42bf1](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0x6aa6d7542310cdc75d1179b8729e1e6ec8d42bf100020000000000000000064b)\nGauge: [0x94981eB72dB7EBcAE91ABd5A810f34B1DBf21108](https://etherscan.io/address/0x94981eB72dB7EBcAE91ABd5A810f34B1DBf21108)\n\nsFRAX/4POOL - Arbitrum \nPool: [0x2CE4457aCac29dA4736aE6f5Cd9F583a6b335c27](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x2CE4457aCac29dA4736aE6f5Cd9F583a6b335c27#readContract)\nChild: [0x050fBe33699E56B577c3D6f090eCE9870A0966bd](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x050fBe33699E56B577c3D6f090eCE9870A0966bd)\nRoot: [0x62A82FE26E21a8807599374CaC8024fae342eF83](https://etherscan.io/address/0x62A82FE26E21a8807599374CaC8024fae342eF83)\n\nsFRAX/wstETH - Arbitrum\nPool:  [0xc757f12694f550d0985ad6e1019c4db4a803f160](https://app.balancer.fi/#/arbitrum/pool/0xc757f12694f550d0985ad6e1019c4db4a803f1600002000000000000000004de)\nChild: [0xeBF2d1995f9bBEa5CE689945b87CA4B5a033B653](https://arbiscan.io/address/0xeBF2d1995f9bBEa5CE689945b87CA4B5a033B653)\nRoot: [0xBE0FC6A0cc4eeeB168dfbDA75523c43dFE7D1F9C](https://etherscan.io/address/0xBE0FC6A0cc4eeeB168dfbDA75523c43dFE7D1F9C)\n\n**Specification:**\n\nThe Balancer Maxi LM Multisig eth:`0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd` and call the addGauge function with the following arguments:\ngauge(address): `0xF6A7ad46b00300344C7d4739C0518db70e722DC4`\ngaugeType(string): `Ethereum`\n\ngauge(address): `0x94981eB72dB7EBcAE91ABd5A810f34B1DBf21108`\ngaugeType(string): `Ethereum`\n\ngauge(address): `0x62A82FE26E21a8807599374CaC8024fae342eF83`\ngaugeType(string): `Arbitrum`\n\ngauge(address): `0xBE0FC6A0cc4eeeB168dfbDA75523c43dFE7D1F9C`\ngaugeType(string): `Arbitrum`\n\nThe pool will have the `core pool` status as per BIP-457",

        "body": "## PRs with Payloads\nhttps://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/168\nhttps://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/169\n\n**Summary:**\n> The initial gauge proposal for COIL/USDC passed as BIP-266 [here](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-266-enable-coil-usdc-gauge-w-2-cap-ethereum/4656). During the gauge creation process, there was concern regarding a 10% or 2% cap and a mistake occurred where the 2% cap gauge was made incorrectly. It directs to the 10% cap gauge itself, as opposed to the COIL/USDC pool. This oversight in process was caught during the execution* process by the Balancer Maxi team, but initial mistake was made by myself. I am proposing the approval of the gauge remade correctly to be activated, and killing of the current gauge based on the specifications below. \n> \n> In terms of preventive actions, @Tritium  has already made an automated script to check all gauges made in the future as payloads are made for them. How this would have worked if in place prior can be seen [here](https://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/blob/alll_prs_report/BIPs/BIP-265-267.report.txt). While this was one of our first mistakes with the gauge creation process, we will do everything in our power to be sure this cannot happen again. We value our partners and ecosystem greatly and want to be sure their experience with us is seamless. \n\n**References/Useful links:**\n\n> For all protocol, governance, and initial specifciation information please reference [BIP-266](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-266-enable-coil-usdc-gauge-w-2-cap-ethereum/4656).\n\n**Specification:**\n\nPart A:\nThe DAO Multisig `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` will interact with the AuthorizerAdaptor at `0x8F42aDBbA1B16EaAE3BB5754915E0D06059aDd75` and call performAction with the GaugeController at `0xC128468b7Ce63eA702C1f104D55A2566b13D3ABD` for the target(address) argument and using 0x3a04f900 followed by the gauge address `0x78a54C8F4eAba82e45cBC20B9454a83CB296e09E` and the corresponding gauge type for the data(bytes) argument.\n\ndata(bytes) :\n\n`0x3a04f90000000000000000000000000078a54c8f4eaba82e45cbc20b9454a83cb296e09e0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000002`\n\n**Killing Old Gauge**\n\nPart B:\nThe DAO Multisig `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` will interact with the AuthorizerAdaptor at `0x8F42aDBbA1B16EaAE3BB5754915E0D06059aDd75` and call performAction using `0xab8f0945` for the `data(bytes)` argument and `0x249034A0EA97E76c2b4AB7a1727CBC52548c531c` for the `target(address)` argument.",

As a reminder many of our current pools are no longer paying protocol fees but are otherwise completely safe - all fees are simply going to LP’s.\n\nThis first wave represents some of our higher priority pools and more will follow in at least one more wave to come. There will be two groups of transactions - group A will add the new gauges to the system and be executed immediately. Group B will kill the gauges for the existing pools and will be executed approximately on March 7th. This is to allow time for the next Aura voting cycle to complete to ensure any protocols providing voting incentives get the full value of those incentives.
