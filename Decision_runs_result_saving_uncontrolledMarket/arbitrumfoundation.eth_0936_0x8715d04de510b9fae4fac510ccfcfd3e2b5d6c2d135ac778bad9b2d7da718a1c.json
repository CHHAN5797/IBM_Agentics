The timeline metrics show unanimous support with strong early voting and stable leadership for the 'For' option. Market impact shows a modest positive price change with a slight TVL decrease. Forum sentiment is mixed, with 4 negative and 7 neutral comments; key concerns involve the appropriateness of funding Gauntlet's resource costs and Uniswap DAO participation costs. Adjacent historical proposal with similar timeline dynamics successfully increased liquidity but faced a TVL decline, offering lessons on incentive allocation.",
