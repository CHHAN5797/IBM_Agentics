        "body": "https://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/1138\n\n**Summary:**\n> Gains Network (gTrade) is a decentralized perpetual futures trading platform on Arbitrum. Gains Network aims to list gUSDC, a token that benefits from protocol fees, on Balancer to establish significant liquidity and integrations within the Arbitrum DeFi ecosystem.\n\n\n**References/Useful links:**\n\n> Link to:\n    • Website: https://gains.trade/ \n    • Documentation: https://gains-network.gitbook.io/docs-home \n    • Github Page: https://github.com/GainsNetwork-org    \n    • Other useful links: https://dune.com/gains/gtrade_stats \n\n**Protocol Description:**\n\n>Gains Network [(gTrade)](https://gains.trade/trading#BTC-USD) is a decentralized perpetual futures trading platform with a robust infrastructure featuring 181 trading pairs with high leverage [up to 150x for crypto, 250x for commodities, and 1000x on forex], deep liquidity, guaranteed order execution, and accurate pricing. Since inception, the protocol has generated $73B lifetime volume.\nThe asset Gains Network would like to list on Balancer is gUSDC. gUSDC is one of the gVault tokens that receives a share of the protocol fees by serving as a counterparty to trader wins & losses.\nThe history price of gUSDC can be publicly viewed on our dune dashboard linked above. It has generally been an “up-only” asset with the exception of a few dips shortly after the launch of the asset back in January.\nThe historical price of gUSDC can be found here: https://dune.com/queries/3385617/5681244\n\n**Motivation:**\n\n> Gains Network aims to enable a gauge for a gUSDC / USDC pool to significantly increase the liquidity for gUSDC on secondary markets to set the foundation for more integrations with the purpose of expanding its utility across Arbitrum DeFi.\n\n**Specifications:**\n \n>Gains Network will utilize a part of its STIP.B LP incentives budget to bootstrap more (sticky) liquidity for the [gUSDC](https://gains.trade/vaults/gUSDC) vault as it anticipates more USDC-collateral usage on gTrade over the coming months. Initially, the focus will be on building liquidity on partner DEXs for gUSDC/USDC pools, including this Balancer pool. This strategy aims to unlock various partnership opportunities, creating an ecosystem around gUSDC through lending markets, LP-strategy protocols, and more.\nGains Network is seeking to co-incentivize this pool with Balancer to establish the required liquidity as a foundation for said gUSDC integrations and consecutively form a long-term partnership with Balancer as one of the main venues for gUSDC since Gains Network believes Balancer is a pool that can largely be maintained beyond incentives through swapping fees post the bootstrapping phase.\n\n1. **Governance:** Provide current information on the protocol’s governance structure.     Provide links to any admin and/or multisig addresses, and describe the powers afforded to these addresses. If there are plans to change the governance system in the future, please explain.    \n\n>The incentives distributor is governed by the following Multisig address: [0xc5fCA2c19c5Ca269a10e15ee4A800ed82F53787D\n](https://arbiscan.io/address/0xc5fCA2c19c5Ca269a10e15ee4A800ed82F53787D)And, Gains Network is actively working towards being a DAO governed through the $GNS token.\n\n2. **Oracles:** Does the protocol rely on external oracles? If so, provide details about the oracles and their implementation in the protocol.\n\n> gTrade leverages their own custom-built Chainlink decentralized oracle network (DON) to provide real-time, aggregated prices for their leveraged trading products. Their oracle architecture uses a custom DON to supply on-demand prices to an aggregator contract while the official Chainlink Price Feeds serve as anchors, meaning if their price differs by more than 1.5% from Chainlink Price Feeds, a circuit breaker is triggered.\n\n3. **Audits:** Provide links to audit reports and any relevant details about security practices.\n\n> Audits are conducted with each upgrade Gains Network undergoes. With the release of [V8 in May](https://medium.com/gains-network/introducing-gtrade-v8-diamond-refactor-and-smart-contract-integration-a175b96ccb82), the entire codebase has been audited. Moreover, the release of [V9](https://x.com/GainsNetwork_io/status/1807877092836610406) [current version] has been audited as well.\n\n4. **Centralization vectors:** Is there any component of the protocol that has centralization vectors? E.g. if only 1 dev manages the project, that is a centralized vector. If price oracles need to be updated by a bot, that is a centralized vector. If liquidations are done by the protocol, that is also a centralization vector.\n\n> We will state our centralization vectors by giving insights into our most centralized facet: the DON. The current custom decentralized oracle network is operated by 8 independent chainlink node operators & 1 price feed from StorkOracle.\n\n5. **Market History:** Has the asset observed severe volatility? In the case of stablecoins, has it depegged? In the case of an unpegged asset, have there been extreme price change events in the past? Provide specific information about the Balancer pool: how long has it been active, TVL, historical volume? **You must provide a direct link to the pool AND a link to your pool's gauge.**\n\n>There’s no information available on the Balancer pool yet as it’s yet to be launched. \nHowever, the gUSDC asset is tradeable on a Ramses CL pool as per June 15th and started to get incentivized with $ARB from June 27th onwards. The pool is currently sitting at $2M TVL and can be found here: https://ramses.exchange/liquidity/v2/0xe9e3ef12f1f9dbaf7b7f57ab262c54117448884b \nSince the inception of this secondary market pool, Gains Network vaults have been consistently overcollateralized while the gUSDC asset has never been below peg and has not experienced significant volatility. Considering the ‘up-only’ nature of gTokens and gUSDC currently sitting at a 124.1% collateralization ratio, the price of gUSDC is expected to continue its upwards price action as time passes. \n\n \n6. **Value:** Is this pool intended to be the primary source of liquidity for the token(s)? If this is not the case, explain the expected value add to Balancer (can this pool generate consistent fees?) \n\n>The pool will not serve as the primary source of liquidity in the bootstrapping phase, but will be leveraged as the primary source of liquidity once the bootstrapping phase has passed. \nThe pool can generate consistent fees due to gUSDC depositors only being able to use Balancer as a means of exiting before our epoch system, looping through lending markets & liquidations through lending markets.\n\nPool: https://app.balancer.fi/#/arbitrum/pool/0xe8a6026365254f779b6927f00f8724ea1b8ae5e0000000000000000000000580\nChild Gauge: https://arbiscan.io/address/0x0CE9489bBD4bfA0Da7b5bb06E4dFa7a5947F76e8\nRoot Gauge: https://etherscan.io/address/0x5A482e8478d63219bC33C7F1d7Cdb599039ABad7\n\nThe Balancer Maxi LM Multisig eth:0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860 will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at 0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd and call the addGauge function with the following arguments:\n\ngauge(address): `0x5A482e8478d63219bC33C7F1d7Cdb599039ABad7`\ngaugeType(string): `Arbitrum`",

        "body": "### PR with Payload\nhttps://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/402\n\n**Summary:**\n\nEnable gauge for a boosted MAI-DOLA LP on Arbitrum. MAI to be boosted via Aave V3.\n\n**Protocol Descriptions:**\n\nMAI\n\nMAI is the most crosschain decentralized stablecoin. It is overcollateralized by decentralized collaterals. A detailed list of collaterals and risk profiles can be found here. \n\nMAI has a long history of supporting Balancer, through collateral integrations and direct emissions. MAI is currently incentivizing Aura voting for MAI-GHO on Ethereum with WETH.\n\nDOLA\n\nDOLA is a CDP stablecoin based primarily on Ethereum. It has a long track record in DeFi and a strong player in the L2 liquidity mining space.\n\n**Motivation**:\n\nWith the decline of certain DEXs on Arbitrum, both DOLA and MAI are looking for consistent liquidity base on Arbitrum. Both projects have committed to incentivizing the voting for this gauge with voting incentives. MAI will directly use protocol revenue from Arbitrum (denominated in WETH) for this purpose.\n\n**Specifications**:\n\n**Governance**: Provide current information on the protocol’s governance structure. Provide links to any admin and/or multisig addresses, and describe the powers afforded to these addresses. If there are plans to change the governance system in the future, please explain.\n\nBoth protocols are DAOs and are governed by their communities.\n\n**Oracles**: Does the protocol rely on external oracles? If so, provide details about the oracles and their implementation in the protocol.\n\nBoth protocols use Chainlink oracles for pricing collaterals.\n\n**Audits**: Provide links to audit reports and any relevant details about security practices.\n\nMAI: The protocol has been audited twice. Audits can be found here: https://docs.mai.finance/risks/security\n\nDOLA: Seen the audit for DOLA here: https://docs.inverse.finance/inverse-finance/technical/audits\n\n**Centralization vectors**: Is there any component of the protocol that has centralization vectors? E.g. if only 1 dev manages the project, that is a centralized vector. If price oracles need to be updated by a bot, that is a centralized vector. If liquidations are done by the protocol, that is also a centralization vector.\n\nMAI: The protocol runs on decentralized systems such as competitive liquidations, and vote-based collateral onboarding. No single person has admin controls over the protocol. The treasury and some part of the protocol are secured by a multisig of doxxed team members. The Aave Guardians standard is currently being implemented at QiDao, with full implementation expected by the end of August.\n\nDOLA: The protocol runs on a decentralized infrastructure, as it is a community-run DAO. Multisigs used within DOLA are disclosed on their site and their holdings are listed.\n\n**Market History:** Has the asset observed severe volatility? In the case of stablecoins, has it depegged? In the case of an unpegged asset, have there been extreme price change events in the past? Provide specific information about the Balancer pool: how long has it been active, TVL, historical volume? You must provide a direct link to the pool AND a link to your pool’s gauge.\n\nMAI and DOLA have existed for several years, being some of the earliest decentralized stablecoins that are still active. Both stablecoins have experienced short periods of volatility in the past, but have been able to recover promptly.\n\n**Value**: Is this pool intended to be the primary source of liquidity for the token(s)? If this is not the case, explain the expected value add to Balancer (can this pool generate consistent fees?)\n\nThis pool will add to Balancer’s market growth within Arbitrum. MAI and DOLA are popular stablecoins in the L2 space and therefore can bring significant activity,\n\nThis move will also increase the amount of voting incentives being received by Balancer DAO.\n\nLink to pool: [0xA50f89e9f439Fde2a6Fe05883721a00475da3C45](https://arbiscan.io/address/0xa50f89e9f439fde2a6fe05883721a00475da3c45#code)\nLink to gauge: [0xa06893ee34F65039a7153A824A1eF399933cBB72](https://etherscan.io/address/0xa06893ee34F65039a7153A824A1eF399933cBB72#readContract)\n\n**Specification:**\n\nThe Balancer Maxi LM Multisig `eth:0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the `GaugeAdderv4` at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd` and call the addGauge function with the following arguments:\ngauge(address): `0xa06893ee34F65039a7153A824A1eF399933cBB72`\ngaugeType(string): `Arbitrum`",

Future pxETH yield and pxETH withdrawals can be tokenized and used within DeFi. Further details about pxETH can be found in the whitepaper [here](https://github.com/redacted-cartel/pirex-eth-whitepaper/blob/master/pxETH_whitepaper.pdf).\n\nIn addition to the DEX liquidity for pxETH incentivized by Redacted DAO, the Dinero protocol has additional mechanisms to improve pxETH liquidity and support the pxETH:ETH peg in both normal and adverse market conditions allowing for greater pxETH DeFi composability.\n\npxETH can be redeemed for ETH from the Dinero protocol either instantaneously for ETH which has yet to be staked or via ETH which is unstaked from validators. In the future a novel incentivized withdrawal pool will facilitate quicker pxETH withdrawals when there is an ETH unstaking queue and/or adverse market conditions.\n\nThe governance token for pxETH is BTRFLY.\n\n**Motivation:**\n\nRedacted has a long and close relationship with Balancer and Aura. Because of this close relationship and Redacted’s vlAURA governance power, we want to have Balancer as the one of our primary venues for crucial pxETH liquidity.\n\nAn LST is only as good as its peg. Therefore for pxETH to be successful, significant liquidity is required. With a gauge, Redacted plans to use its governance power and bribes to direct emissions to the gauge and incentivize crucial pxETH liquidity on Balancer, allowing for higher volumes in the LP and also generating fees for veBAL holders.\n\n**Specifications:**\n\n1. **Governance:**\n\nRedacted’s governance is currently off-chain using [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/redactedcartel.eth). The multisig address is: 0xA52Fd396891E7A74b641a2Cb1A6999Fcf56B077e. Decisions relating to inflation, liquidity, partnership or DAO treasury go through a DAO vote, and then are executed by the multisig. On-chain governance will come at a later stage.\n\n2. **Oracles:** Does the protocol rely on external oracles? If so, provide details about the oracles and their implementation in the protocol.\n\nNo oracles are currently used.\n\n3. **Audits:** Provide links to audit reports and any relevant details about security practices.\n\nLink to all audits can be found [here](https://dineroismoney.com/docs/security).\n\n4. **Centralization vectors:** Is there any component of the protocol that has centralization vectors? E.g. if only 1 dev manages the project, that is a centralized vector. If price oracles need to be updated by a bot, that is a centralized vector. If liquidations are done by the protocol, that is also a centralization vector.\n\n4/7 multisig (0xA52Fd396891E7A74b641a2Cb1A6999Fcf56B077e) controls the pushing of validators public keys to the contract.\n\n5. **Market History:** Has the asset observed severe volatility? In the case of stablecoins, has it depegged? In the case of an unpegged asset, have there been extreme price change events in the past? Provide specific information about the Balancer pool: how long has it been active, TVL, historical volume? **You must provide a direct link to the pool AND a link to your pool's gauge.**\n\nThe pxETH/ETH pool has not yet been seeded. As explained above, pxETH has redemption mechanisms which allow the peg to be maintained/ arbitraged. Since launch on 2023/12/13, the main liquidity for pxETH is on Maverick (in anticipation of a gauge on Balancer).\n\n6. **Value:** Is this pool intended to be the primary source of liquidity for the token(s)? If this is not the case, explain the expected value add to Balancer (can this pool generate consistent fees?)\n\nWith a gauge, Redacted plans to use its governance power and bribes to direct emissions to the gauge and incentivize crucial pxETH liquidity on Balancer, allowing for higher volumes in the LP and also generating fees for veBAL holders.\n\n**Specification:**\n\nThe Balancer Maxi LM Multisig eth:`0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd` and call the addGauge function with the following arguments:\ngauge(address): `0xdee29b7b6dF3576280bFBbC088ee9eBAA767C0Bd`\ngaugeType(string): `Ethereum`",

        "body": "Gauge Proposal Template:\n\n**Summary:**\n\nAdd a a gauge for MAI/USDC on Ethereum.\n\n**References/Useful links:**\n\n> Link to: (cant put more than 2 links on a proposal, so linked in a reply)\n\n\n**Protocol Description:**\n\nMAI is the most crosschain decentralized stablecoin. It is overcollateralized by decentralized collaterals. MAI has been tested and maintained its peg during several market downturns, notably in May 2022.\n\nThe protocol is currently the #1 external use case for BAL on Polygon. It also incentivizes the main Balancer stablecoin pool on Polygon as well as other pools on Arbitrum and Fantom (Beethoven).\n\n**Motivation:**\n\nMAI is the only means to bridge large sums of capital across the broader crosschain universe. This is a good opportunity for Balancer to capture volume from whales bridging in and out of Ethereum.\n\n**Specifications:**\n \n1. **Governance:** Provide current information on the protocol’s governance structure.     Provide links to any admin and/or multisig addresses, and describe the powers afforded to these addresses. If there are plans to change the governance system in the future, please explain.    \n\nMAI is controlled by a DAO. More info can be found here: https://docs.mai.finance/tokenomics-1/qi-token\n\n2. **Oracles:** Does the protocol rely on external oracles? If so, provide details about the oracles and their implementation in the protocol.\n\nWe use Chainlink oracles to price collateral assets.\n\n3. **Audits:** Provide links to audit reports and any relevant details about security practices.\n\nThe protocol has been audited twice. Audits can be found here: https://docs.mai.finance/risks/security\n\n4. **Centralization vectors:** Is there any component of the protocol that has centralization vectors? E.g. if only 1 dev manages the project, that is a centralized vector. If price oracles need to be updated by a bot, that is a centralized vector. If liquidations are done by the protocol, that is also a centralization vector.\n\nThe protocol runs on decentralized systems such as competitive liquidations, and vote-based collateral onboarding. No single person has admin controls over the protocol. The treasury and some part of the protocol are secured by a multisig of doxxed team members.\n\n5. **Market History:** Has the asset observed severe volatility? In the case of stablecoins, has it depegged? In the case of an unpegged asset, have there been extreme price change events in the past? Provide specific information about the Balancer pool: how long has it been active, TVL, historical volume? **You must provide a direct link to the pool AND a link to your pool's gauge.**\n\nMAI has remained stable over the last 12 months, despite adverse market conditions. MAI has held Curve pools for several months, for most of which it has provided a considerable share of volume on Polygon and Fantom.\n\nThe pool in question on this proposal was created recently with the aim of launching QiDao on Ethereum.\n \n6. **Value:** Is this pool intended to be the primary source of liquidity for the token(s)? If this is not the case, explain the expected value add to Balancer (can this pool generate consistent fees?) \n\nThis will be the only intial incentivized liquidity on Ethereum for MAI.\n\npool link: [Balancer ](https://app.balancer.fi/#/pool/0xf3aeb3abba741f0eece8a1b1d2f11b85899951cb000200000000000000000351)\n\ngauge address: [Vyper_contract | Address 0x91a75880b07d36672f5c8dfe0f2334f086e29d47 | Etherscan ](https://etherscan.io/address/0x91a75880b07d36672f5c8dfe0f2334f086e29d47)",
