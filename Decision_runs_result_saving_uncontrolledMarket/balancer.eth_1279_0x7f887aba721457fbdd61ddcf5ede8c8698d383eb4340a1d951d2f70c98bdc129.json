The protocol fee shall kick in as soon as rewards start. With a lower protocol fee LP yield can be sustainably increased, helping to bootstrap the specified Rehype Pools.\n\n### References/Useful links\n* [Documentation of Rehype Pools](https://docs.gyro.finance/gyroscope-protocol/concentrated-liquidity-pools/rehype-e-clps)\n* [Website](https://gyro.finance/)\n* [Github](https://github.com/gyrostable)\n* [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/2vnqnS7wE6)\n* [X](https://twitter.com/GyroStable)\n\n---\n\n### Protocol description\n* stataArbUSDT (or in short, aUSDT) is the wrapped, static version of the rebasing Aave lending deposit token for aUSDT on Arbitrum. - [Aave ](https://github.com/bgd-labs/static-a-token-v3)\n* stataArbUSDCn (or in short, aUSDC) is the wrapped, static version of the rebasing Aave lending deposit token for aUSDC on Arbitrum. - [Aave ](https://github.com/bgd-labs/static-a-token-v3)\n* GYD is a USD denominated stablecoin, issued by the [Gyroscope protocol](https://gyro.finance/)\n---\n\n### Motivation\nGyroscope wants to obtain the option to participate in voting markets for two previously deployed pools.\n\n---\n\n### Specifications\n#### Governance\nThe Gyroscope Protocol will be governed by a DAO and relevant stakeholder with the full launch on Ethereum.

As per previous arrangements between Balancer and Gnosis this pool shall not bear any protocol fees for the time being.\n\n**References/Useful links:**\n\n> * [Documentation of E-CLPs](https://docs.gyro.finance/gyroscope-protocol/concentrated-liquidity-pools/e-clps)\n> * [Website](https://gyro.finance/)\n> * [Github](https://github.com/gyrostable)\n> * [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/2vnqnS7wE6)\n> * [X](https://twitter.com/GyroStable)\n\n**Protocol Description:**\n\n> * [When staking ETH with RocketPool] you will be given a token called rETH. rETH represents both how much ETH you deposited, and when you deposited it. The ratio includes rewards that Rocket Pool node operators earn from: The Beacon Chain itself, Priority fees from block proposals, and MEV rewards from block proposals. - [RocketPool](https://docs.rocketpool.net/guides/staking/overview.html#the-reth-token)\n> * WETH is a wrapper-token and an ERC-20 token representing ETH at a 1:1 ratio.\n>* The E-CLP uses an internal conversion to avoid a unit drift of yield-accruing tokens.\n\n**Motivation:**\n\n> Gyroscope is expanding to Gnosis Chain.\n\n**Specifications:**\n \n**Governance:**\n> The Gyroscope Protocol will be governed by a DAO and relevant stakeholder with the full launch on Ethereum. For now, the FTL Labs multi-sig can pause the pool, change the swap fee and set the protocol fee. As a custom pool by Gyroscope, the E-CLP will be controlled by Gyroscope governance upon its launch.\n\n**Oracles:**\n\n> * ‘rateProvider0’: WETH rate provider on Gnosis Chain: 0x00\n> * ‘rateProvider1’: rETH rate provider on Gnosis Chain: [0xdc90e2680094314CEaB45CE15100F6e02cEB7ceD](https://gnosisscan.io/address/0xdc90e2680094314CEaB45CE15100F6e02cEB7ceD)\n\n**Audits:**\n\n> Audit reports by Nethermind, Trail of Bits, and Runtime Verification can be accessed here (the E-CLP is called the “CEMM” in these reports). In addition, the E-CLP code has been live in production on Polygon since November 2022.\n\n**Centralization vectors:**\n\n> No centralization vectors. The FTL Labs team’s multi-sig can - currently - pause the pool, change the swap fee and set the protocol fee.\n\n**Market History:**\n\n> The Gyroscope Protocol is live on Ethereum since EOY23, with E-CLPs on several other chains. Details available [here ](https://dune.com/gyro_finance/gyroscope-e-clps).\n \n**Value:**\n\n> As per “Motivation”.\n\n\n**Contracts**\n\n> * E-CLP: [0x71E1179C5e197FA551BEEC85ca2EF8693c61b85b](https://gnosisscan.io/address/0x71E1179C5e197FA551BEEC85ca2EF8693c61b85b)\n> * Childchain gauge on Gnosis Chain: [0x25F822EB509177e393a32181182ae3981eeE6E53](https://gnosisscan.io/address/0x25F822EB509177e393a32181182ae3981eeE6E53)\n> * Gnosis Chain root gauge on Ethereum: [0xBf4116cEf22D4565A16696427Eaefc248F47Beb6](https://etherscan.io/address/0xBf4116cEf22D4565A16696427Eaefc248F47Beb6)\n\nTechnical Specification: \n\nTransaction: The Balancer Maxi LM Multisig `eth:0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd` and call the `addGauge` function with the following arguments:\n\ngauge(address): `0xBf4116cEf22D4565A16696427Eaefc248F47Beb6`\n\ngaugeType(string): `Gnosis`",
