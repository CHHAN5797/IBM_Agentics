They enable trading along the curve of an ellipse. This pool type is ideally suited for liquid staking tokens, is typically more capital efficient and could thus generate significant trading volume.\n> * **The pool shall be a ‘Core’ pool with a swap fee of 1 basis points, i.e., 0.01% at pool inception.** The fee split is as follows: 50% of all collected fees will go to liquidity providers, while the remaining 50% will go towards Balancer. At pool inception, no fees will go towards Gyroscope. As a Core pool it will be eligible for fee recycling.\n\n> ## References/Useful links\n> \n> * [Slidedeck on E-CLPs](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/16Qt-8PaLJ_1FkaNnI4rocEYUDrG1ktW3u4R6yeSwY68/edit#slide=id.g208e5b00ffd_0_95)\n> * [Documentation of E-CLPs](https://docs.gyro.finance/gyroscope-protocol/concentrated-liquidity-pools/e-clps#description-of-e-clps)\n> * [Website](https://gyro.finance/)\n> * [Github](https://github.com/gyrostable)\n> * [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/2vnqnS7wE6)\n\n> ## Protocol description\n> \n> * stETH is a token that represents staked ether in Lido, combining the value of initial deposit + staking rewards. stETH tokens are minted upon deposit and burned when redeemed. stETH token balances are issued 1:1 to the ethers that are staked by Lido. stETH token’s balances are updated when the oracle reports change in total stake every day. - [Lido](https://help.lido.fi/en/articles/5230610-what-is-steth)\n> * wstETH is a wrapped version of regular stETH, while wETH is a wrapped version of Ethereum.\n> * swETH is an ERC-20 token that represents a user’s staked ETH in the Ethereum blockchain inclusive of any accrued rewards and penalties from the consensus layer, and MEV and ‘tips’ from the execution layer. The amount of swETH held will not change over a period of time but the underlying value of the token will increase as the rewards accrue on chain. - [Swell](https://docs.swellnetwork.io/swell/system-design/staking-with-sweth/sweth-token)\n> * The E-CLP uses an internal conversion to avoid a unit drift of yield-accruing tokens.\n\n> ## Motivation\n> \n> **We expect the E-CLP to improve capital efficiency significantly.** The E-CLP’s efficiency gains are possible due to:\n> \n> * **Customizable liquidity profiles:** Using the curve of an ellipse enables highly customizable liquidity profiles. E-CLPs can be calibrated to approximate most trading curves that would be desired. E-CLP curves can be tailored to have certain regions of low price impact and other regions of high price impact.\n> * **Price bounds:** The E-CLP concentrates liquidity within price-bounds that enable the E-CLP to be highly capital-efficient. Functionally, this works by enabling arbitrary truncation of liquidity profiles from a given trading curve. In effect, the capital efficiency comes from bounding the trading curve to an expected trading range of the assets.\n> \n> For an overview of previously deployed E-CLPs view: https://dune.com/gyro_finance/gyroscope-e-clps\n> \n> E-CLPs have been developed for stablecoin pools that include the upcoming Gyroscope stablecoin, GYD. However, they can find broader application, whenever the expected trading range of the included assets can be informed by external business logic (e.g. from arbitrage loops of mints/ redemptions in the case of LSTs).\n\n## Specifications\n\n> ### Governance\n> \n> The Gyroscope Protocol is in limited production live on Polygon. The Gyroscope Protocol will be governed by a DAO and relevant stakeholder with the full launch on Ethereum. For now, the FTL Labs multi-sig can pause the pool, change the swap fee and set the protocol fee. As a custom pool by Gyroscope, the E-CLP will be controlled by Gyroscope governance upon its launch.\n\n> ### Oracles\n> \n> * rateProvider0 (for wstETH): [0x72D07D7DcA67b8A406aD1Ec34ce969c90bFEE768](https://etherscan.io/address/0x72D07D7DcA67b8A406aD1Ec34ce969c90bFEE768#code)\n> * rateProvider1 (for swETH): [0xf951E335afb289353dc249e82926178EaC7DEd78](https://etherscan.io/address/0xf951E335afb289353dc249e82926178EaC7DEd78)\n> * (allows to control for a price drift from accruing yield by using rate providers to first convert from yield accruing tokens to the underlying)\n\n> ### Audits\n> \n> Audit reports by Nethermind, Trail of Bits, and Runtime Verification can be accessed here (the E-CLP is called the “CEMM” in these reports). In addition, the E-CLP code has been live in production on Polygon since November 2022.\n\n> ### Centralization vectors\n> \n> No centralization vectors. The FTL Labs team’s multi-sig can - currently - pause the pool, change the swap fee and set the protocol fee.\n\n> ### Market History\n> \n> C.f. contracts.\n\n> ### Value\n> \n> As per “Motivation”. Other Ethereum Balancer pools with these assets exist, but none of them feature asymmetrically concentrated liquidity. Asymmetric concentrated liquidity for these assets could become a substantial driver of trading volume and total value locked.\n\n> ### Contracts\n> \n> * swETH/wstETH E-CLP: [0x127ECc2318d002664cc4515C9f2B22B09b6aea85](https://etherscan.io/address/0x127ecc2318d002664cc4515c9f2b22b09b6aea85#readContract)\n> \n> * Mainnet gauge: [0x17748Aa07A6a1Be2ACE8bCC546919C006B40De34](https://etherscan.io/address/0x17748Aa07A6a1Be2ACE8bCC546919C006B40De34)\n\nSpecifcation:\n\nThe Balancer Maxi LM Multisig eth:`0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd` and call the addGauge function with the following arguments:\ngauge(address):`0x17748Aa07A6a1Be2ACE8bCC546919C006B40De34`\ngaugeType(string): `Ethereum`",

The stacked area chart shows how the E-CLP already reached up to 55% of the total market share of stMATIC on Polygon soon after inception, with only a fraction of total TVL.*\n> \n>  ![gyro1.png](ipfs://bafkreifpe3brj7btgkabof7if2zrm2huyd62xjky223schjnnkzo5d6fia)\n> \n>  ![gyro2.png](ipfs://bafybeifiprubxky4vdikxilkbt5joms4aaihk2b2r25jruimh6jb6xf6bu)\n> \n> * E-CLPs have been developed for stablecoin pools that include the upcoming Gyroscope stablecoin, GYD. However, they can find broader application, whenever the expected trading range of the included assets can be informed by external business logic (e.g. from arbitrage loops of mints/ redemptions in the case of LSTs).\n\n> ## Specifications\n> \n> > * **Governance**\n> > \n> >   The Gyroscope Protocol is in limited production live on Polygon. The Gyroscope Protocol will be governed by a DAO and relevant stakeholder with the full launch on Ethereum.

There is more than USD3.7mil ETH staked at the time of writing.\n\n**Protocol Description**\n\nBedrock's native tokenized version of staked Ether is known as uniETH.\n\nuniETH represents the staked ETH in Bedrock plus all future staking rewards. uniETH is non-rebasing, i.e. does not grow in quantity over time but grows in value instead. In other words, 1 uniETH will be worth more than 1 ETH as time goes on, and its value will continue to increase as more time passes. uniETH’s non-rebasing model allows users to hold uniETH on centralized exchanges and use it in decentralized financial applications seamlessly.\n\nLaunched by RockX, Bedrock is a non-custodial solution that satisfies the requirements of institutions seeking a basis for large-scale liquid staking. By bringing new levels of transparency and security to liquid staking, Bedrock allows institutions to unlock liquidity safely by adhering to regulations while leveraging a true crypto-native solution.\n\nReferences/Useful links\n\n[[uniETH DApp](https://bedrock.rockx.com/unieth/stake)]\n[[Learn more about uniETH](https://bedrock.rockx.com/unieth)]\n[[uniETH audit report](https://github.com/RockX-SG/stake/blob/main/PeckShield-Audit-Report-RockXStaking-v1.0.pdf)]\n[[Learn more about Bedrock](https://www.rockx.com/liquid-staking)]\n[[Bedrock DAO Twitter](https://twitter.com/bedrock_dao)]\n[[RockX Twitter](https://twitter.com/rockx_official)]\n[[Discord]()]\n\n**Motivation**\n\nBalancer’s ability to increase capital efficiency using composable pools is taking shape across the industry. The uniETH-wETH pool fits Balancer’s initiative to be a protocol where Liquidity Pools can safely tap into external yield sources while maintaining effective liquidity for swapping:\n\n* uniETH-wETH pool will earn yield for both liquidity providers and Balancer\n* uniETH-wETH pool also provides Bedrock with a place for its tokens to be swapped and deposited easily as the pool increases in TVL\n\n**Specifications**\n\n**Governance**: The BedrockDAO is slated to launch in the coming months with a DAO token that utilizes the vote escrow model for its token holders to participate in protocol governance and more. An update regarding the DAO token can be found [here](https://medium.com/@bedrock_dao/bedrock-1-month-update-whats-next-spoiler-airdrop-e8872425d23d) \n\n**Oracles**: This pool relies on on-chain data calculations, and not on rate providers, to determine uniETH’s balance and estimated rewards.\n\n**Audits**: See uniETH’s smart contract audit by Peckshield [here](https://github.com/RockX-SG/stake/blob/main/PeckShield-Audit-Report-RockXStaking-v1.0.pdf).\n\n**Centralization Vectors**: See the architecture of uniETH [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RockX-SG/stake/main/doc/uniETH_ETH2_0_Liquid_Staking_Explained.pdf). All treasury contracts and protocol upgrades have multi-signature wallets in place.\n\nThe multisignature account is the owner of the following contracts\n\nUNIVERSAL_ETH_ADDRESS: '0xF1376bceF0f78459C0Ed0ba5ddce976F1ddF51F4'\n\nSTAKING_ADDRESS: '0x4beFa2aA9c305238AA3E0b5D17eB20C045269E9d'\n\nREDEEM_ADDRESS: '0x98169228cB99Ed26c1043eD8Ca53A5Cb371D3B8D'\n\nPROXY_ADMIN: '0xa5F2B6AB5B38b88Ba221741b3A189999b4c889C6'\n\nThe manager role to withdraw manager’s rewards: ‘0x4beFa2aA9c305238AA3E0b5D17eB20C045269E9d’\n\n**Market History**: The uniETH token and Bedrock product only went live after our team was able to rigorously test the functionality of staking and unstaking ETH on-chain after the Shapella upgrade. Since its launch, uniETH has been one of the fastest growing liquid staking tokens with more than 2176 ETH (> USD3.7mil) staked on Bedrock.\n\n**Value:** uniETH is poised to drive great value to the Balancer ecosystem because Balancer will serve as the main liquidity provider for the uniETH-wETH swap pair. Balancer provides uniETH holders the option to swap their uniETH for wETH immediately and in amounts of less than 32 ETH, as opposed to observing a 2-10 day unstaking period if executed through the Bedrock product.\n\nBedrock’s uniETH follows AML protocols with KYC/KYB checks required for users who intend to mint more than 32 ETH equivalent of uniETH.\n\n* With this built-in AML capability, uniETH expects to see an influx of institutional funds\n* This will increase the demand for immediate uniETH liquidity on Balancer.\n\nAs a result, liquidity providers will earn the protocol fee on underlying uniETH as well as swap fees.\n\nIn addition, liquidity providers may be entitled to the upcoming Bedrock DAO token airdrop and have access to all its corresponding utilities.\n\n**Pool Address**: 0xbFCe47224B4A938865E3e2727DC34E0fAA5b1D82\n\n**Gauge Address**: 0x6AF7bCA454f3C8165225Ed46FD4d78cc90E81fAA\n\n**Transaction Specification:**\n\nThe Balancer Maxi LM Multisig `eth:0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the `GaugeAdderv4` at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd` and call the addGauge function with the following arguments:\n\ngauge(address): `0x6AF7bCA454f3C8165225Ed46FD4d78cc90E81fAA`\ngaugeType(string): `Ethereum`",
