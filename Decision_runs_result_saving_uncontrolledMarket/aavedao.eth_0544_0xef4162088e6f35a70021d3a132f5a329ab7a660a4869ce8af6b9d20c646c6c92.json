The prospect of becoming a paid delegate has emerged and this publication seeks to define the relationship between delegate and service provider in the context of receiving payment from Aave.\n\nAt the core of the topic, should a Service Provider that offers a Delegation Platform receive additional payment for providing the Delegation Platform service. Similarly, should Delegation Platforms who progress to becoming a service provider continue to receive delegation platform payments. How could Aave remunerate delegates who offer more than governance participation. Are these mutually exclusive payments or is the same entity able to receive payment for being both a delegate and Service Provider.\n\nAs Aave does not offer payment for providing a Delegation Platform, this conversation is pre-empting a future state within the community. By having this conversation now, it will provide clear indication of the communities sentiment to be factored into various contributors future plans whilst not adversley affecting any current contributor. \n\n# Motivation\n\nA quick summary of Delegation Platforms which are either current or proposing to become a Service Provider:\n\n* [ACI Delegation Platform](https://governance.aave.com/t/aave-chan-initiative-delegate-platform/10877)\n* [ACI 6 Month Budget](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-aave-chan-initiative-6-month-budget-proposal/12344/12)\n* [Llama Delegation Platform](https://governance.aave.com/t/delegate-to-llama/9043)\n* [Llama <> Aave](https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/104/)\n\nAt the time of writing neither of the teams mentioned above are seeking payment for being a delegate.\n\nThere are numerous delegates within the Aave ecosystem which are supportive of delegates receiving payment for the service they are offering Aave. This has been mentioned in the comments on this [thread](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-aave-chan-initiative-6-month-budget-proposal/12344/6). Through passing conversations and reading over other governance threads, several current delegates are intending or considering contributing to Aave beyond participating in governance decisions. \n\nWith the emergence of the prospect for paid delegation and there already being service proviers with delegations platforms, there is the potential for Aave to provide payment to the same entity for being both Service Provider and Delegate. This publication does not present an opinion, as it affects the author, but seeks to kick start the conversation and will continue to update the post based upon community feedback.\n\nFrom a budget perspective, Aave needs to consider the prospect of remunerating delegates and how this affects service providers with delegation platforms. Similarly, how would Aave reward delegates who provide a service beyond participating in governance. \n\nTo help kick start conversation, a few considerations are shared below:\n\n* Delegation Platforms are providing a service to Aave and therefore should be considered service providers and thus rewarded for there efforts.\n* Service Providers are sufficiently paid and any delegation platform should not receive additional payment.\n* Delegation platforms represent an additional time commitment for Service Providers and should be consider worthy of a separate payment.\n* Delegation Platforms may seek to submit AIPs and spearhead initiatives adding value beyond a voting service. Examples include supporting adoption of GHO and market marking services etc...\n* AGD can be used to provide incremental payments to delegates who perform a service beyond voting participation\n* Should Aave consider a potential voting delegation renumeration construct which recognises registered addresses with voting influence and how active they are within Aave governance. There are several iterations of this across the industry which can researched and tailored to suit Aave. Would this approach include or exclude Service Providers.\n* Delegation Platform may build a material voting base which then enables easier transition to becoming a Service Provider.\n* Service Providers require proposal power to submit AIP and the emergence of delegation platforms may lead to teams loosing proposal power preventing AIPs from being submitted. This may suggest a preference for Aave or stkAAVE holders to separate voting and proposal power delegation.\n\nThe above outlines some considerations for discussion in the comments.\n\n# Voting Options\n\n---\n\n**Option 1 - Delegate Gas Rebate Program**\n\nThis option reflects the proposal outline [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-gas-fee-rebate-for-on-chain-votes/12559) and no additional funding outside of this proposal is to be allocated to delegates for governance participating during the next 6 months. After the 6 month window has passed Aave DAO is then able to review this decision. \n\n---\n\n**Option 2 - Incentivised Delegates Program excluding Service Providers**\n\n@Llama shall design an Incentivised Delegate Program, which only recognised delegates are eligible for inclusion within, for the community to review and comment on. This will include a review of existing programs already implemented in the industry, with the a recommended program being published as a TEMP CHECK for the Aave DAO to review and iterate on.\n\nDo note, Service Providers are excluded from receiving economic reward for being a recognised delegate platform.\n\n---\n\n**Option 3 - Incentivised Delegate & Service Providers including Service Providers**\n\nSimilar to Option 2, with the only difference being Service Provider are to receive payment as a Recognised Delegates.\n\n---\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

        "body": "## ***Summary***\n\nThe London Business School (LBS) Blockchain Society, in alliance with Flipside Governance (@fig), FranklinDAO (@PennBlockchain), the University of Michigan (@Michigan_Blockchain), and Columbia University (@BlockchainAtColumbia), proposes to institute a gas fee rebate mechanism for recognised delegates voting on-chain on Aave.\n\n## ***Motivation***\n\nGas fees on Ethereum have been increasing recently. As shown by data from Dune Analytics, median gas prices sit at around 30 gwei, with intradaily spikes often far exceeding that level. The amount of gas fees required for voting on-chain has therefore risen proportionally, increasing the cost of on-chain governance for delegates (particularly in light of the heavier recent proposal load at Aave).\n\n**![|537x363](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/oDESh98-zthvbro3LnZuiQcCRWRRqMXRcC_HzQNnbdKmKLZ40BN5_Zes9fmVp2kg7tMLV7uAmJKMqHvl-IAH45Ycf17xD-XRzrphEo_oUpREx-AtZYZ6cg0IRjiRB7AjKMPVI9bfyfHxjtr2ybCclrE)**\n\nTo find out more about gas costs on Aave, refer to the following dashboards created by Flipside here:\n\n* https://flipsidecrypto.xyz/janan/aave-delegates-rayk2E\n* https://flipsidecrypto.xyz/alitaslimi/aave-delegates-gas-usage-9LderL\n* https://flipsidecrypto.xyz/Ali3N/aave-delegates-gas-usage-136ks0\n* https://flipsidecrypto.xyz/panda-gXSkiX/aave-gas-usage-on-votes-_zF8ba\n\nLBS Blockchain Society, like other peer universities, is a not-for-profit, student-run organisation that depends on sponsorships and stipends to finance its operations. We currently receive monthly compensation for participating in MakerDAO governance, but otherwise receive no other form or income. Other schools like FranklinDAO (Penn Blockchain) are in very similar states. So far, we have been using this to cover gas costs at Aave, but the cost of on-chain governance remains a growing concern for us.\n\nIn light of this, we see rebating delegates for their participation as having the following benefits:\n\n* Incentivise more active engagement of the delegate community by removing the disincentive to vote. Broader participation leads to better decision-making for Aave.\n* Create a more diverse voter base that includes student organisations such as ours. Reducing the barrier to entry for voting creates a more open, collaborative delegate ecosystem. This in turn drives participation.\n* Retain the best delegates to drive growth of the Aave ecosystem. Aave should remain competitive with its peers (e.g., Maker) to attract and retain the best delegate talent. The fundamental cost of being a great Aave delegate should not be at a net cost to the delegate with regards to spending ever-increasing gas costs.\n* Achievable at relatively low cost. We also outline measures to reduce the administrative burden for Aave below.\n\n## ***Specification***\n\n*Participation Criteria*\n\nTo incentivise maximal voter participation, we propose a participation-based rebate system. Participation is defined by the proportion of proposals, being the sum total of Snapshot polls and AIPs, voted on by a Recognized Delegate over the lesser of: 1) the previous 90 days, or 2) since becoming a Recognized Delegate. A Participation score of 100% would mean that a Delegate has voted on all polls and AIPs over this period. Moreover, only delegate platforms with 10k+ AAVE in voting power will be eligible for gas fee rebates, in order to avoid spam - the 10k is a small enough number to allow for enough delegate participation but filters out any spam.\n\n*Note*: A Recognized Delegate is one with an Aave Delegate Platform, such as the LBS Blockchain Society, University of Michigan, FranklinDAO, Flipside, Llama, Aave Chan Initiative, Stablelabs, etc. The list of Recognized Delegates is open to change over time. A list of Aave Delegate Platforms can be found here, but note that there are a few new platforms and all of them may not have the required 10k AAVE voting power.\n\n|Participation Rate over Previous 90 days|Gas Rebate|\n| --- | --- |\n|>80%|100%|\n|50% to 80%|50%|\n|<50%|0%|\n\n*Claiming Process*\n\nTo reduce the administrative burden for Aave, we propose the claiming process should be initiated by Recognized Delegates themselves. Every month, Recognized Delegates have the option to submit a Gas Rebate Application to Aave, which shall include:\n\n1. The list of transactions associated with voting on Aave proposals over that month\n2. The corresponding gas fees spent on each transaction\n3. Etherscan links detailing the above\n\nDelegates can also choose to batch their Gas Rebate Applications (i.e. submit a single application for multiple months). However, any gas fees not claimed over a 12 month period will be automatically forfeited.\n\nOnce an application has been submitted to Aave, an appointed Governance Facilitator will review the applications and submit an AIP to pay out the gas fees. To that end, we have created a Dune dashboard that the Governance Facilitator can use to calculate the gas costs paid by a specific address, i.e., the address used by delegates to vote. The dashboard can be found [here](https://dune.com/parkyeung/aave-governance-voting-gas-costs). Initially, we propose that the Aave Chan Initiative plays the role of Governance Facilitator.\n\nTo calculate the participation rate for delegates, we recommend using the following formula:\n\n*Number of Proposals Voted on Since First Vote / Total Number of Proposals Since First Vote*\n\nFor example, assume a Delegate Platform’s first vote was on Jan 1 2023. If they apply for a gas rebate on Feb 1 2023, and there have been 20 proposals between Jan 1 and Feb 1, out of which the Delegate has voted for 17 proposals, their participation rate is 85%.\n\nWe are working to publish a tool to easily calculate participation rate for the Governance Facilitator and will update this post once it is ready.\n\nWe propose the funds to be paid from the Ethereum v2 Collector Contract, but defer to the community for guidance on the most appropriate source of funds.\n\n*Gas Rebate Token*\n\nWe consider two options for the Gas Rebate Token: 1) ETH, the native asset in which gas fees are paid, and 2) stablecoins (e.g. USDC, DAI).\n\nThe list of holdings in the Ethereum v2 Collector Contract can be found [here](https://etherscan.io/tokenholdings?a=0x464c71f6c2f760dda6093dcb91c24c39e5d6e18c#assets-wallet).\n\nEach option above has associated trade-offs (for example certain assets may be deemed more strategic than others, or represent larger existing holdings). We would welcome community feedback on the most appropriate asset in advance of voting.\n\n## ***References***\n\nWe have taken inspiration from MakerDAO’s [MIP61: Recognized Delegate Compensation](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP61#performance-modifier).\n\nOther sources include Dune Analytics.\n\n## ***Copyright***\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

These proposals have caused disruptions in Aave’s off-chain governance and have resulted in a waste of time and resources.\n\nTo prevent these incidents from happening again, we propose modifying the Snapshot proposal threshold to 250 AAVE. \n\n## Motivation:\n\nWe recommend that the community update the proposal threshold to a level that would deter scammers and bad actors. The new threshold would require proposals to meet certain minimum requirements, in this case holding or delegated 250 AAVE (or equivalent.)\n\nThis level is 3.3X the previous proposal threshold as of 04/07/23. By updating this threshold, we can ensure that only legitimate proposals are considered and that the risk of scams, illegitimate, or fraudulent proposals is significantly reduced.\n\nHere is an example of recurring junk proposals:\n \n![Screen Shot 2023-05-01 at 4.12.43 PM.png](ipfs://bafkreibwvoifwhv6uqyeatkzt44rndspw75jm5lx2afcl23qghwgy37ajy)\n    \n\nBy modifying the proposal threshold required to post a Snapshot, there are many benefits for Aave’s off-chain Governance process.\n\nA few notable ones include:\n\n1. *Better quality proposals:* By setting a higher threshold, we will receive proposals from more experienced and qualified professionals and delegates\n2. *Reduced risk of fraud:* Increasing the proposal threshold will help to reduce the risk of scams and fraudulent proposals.\n3. *Improved efficiency:* By setting a higher threshold, we will have fewer proposals to review, which will help us to be more efficient with our time and resources.\n\n## Specification:\n\nTo implement this proposal, an Aave Snapshot admin will need to update the space’s proposal threshold to 250 AAVE and communicate these new requirements.\n\nA list of existing admins with this ability:\n\n* @monet-supply \n* @marczeller\n* 0xc8E0345596D7196941E61D3aB607E57Fe61F85E7\n* 0x2357df661D0E56140dF30c3ad0b2B426fB4666e6\n* 0x60C8dC4762b217b4A00FF1824111077f331B1FbF\n* 0x2D0D6A8553993a3E9eD1D86415358D1EDEfa82F1\n\n\n## Next Steps\n\nNext steps to ensure a successful upgrade of Snapshot’s proposal threshold:\n\n1. Gather feedback and input from the Aave community on the proposed threshold\n2. Incorporate and refine the proposal based on feedback from the community\n3. Upgrade and communicate the new requirements to potential proposers\n\n\n## Conclusion:\n\nIncreasing the proposal threshold is a simple but effective way to prevent scammers and bad actors from submitting proposals.\n\nBy doing so, we can ensure that we receive better quality proposals, reduce the risk of fraud, and be more efficient with our time and resources.\n\nFlipside will work with community stakeholders like @MatthewGraham (TokenLogic) @MarcZeller (ACI) @bgdlabs to create related proposals which revamp and updates the Snapshot space and permissions.\n\nThis is the first of a series to come.\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.",

Era empowers users with more security and embeds into the familiar infrastructure and ecosystem of EVM.\n\nzkSync Era has launched with a diverse array of DeFi offerings, listed in its ecosystem documents – and others on the way. Deploying Aave V3 on zkSync Era could provide opportunities for growth and collaboration between the Aave and zkSync communities.\n\nEra provides key EVM features, such as smart contract composability - leading to easier deployment of Aave V3 and requiring minimal development work.\n\n## Motivation\nThe Aave community has previously voted to deploy the Aave V3 codebase on zkSync’s v2 Testnet, approved by this off-chain vote. With the release of Era Mainnet, it is possible to re-invest the work of developers, empowering Aave as a hub for mainnet activity and liquidity.\n\nzkSync has the potential to benefit the Aave ecosystem by introducing new users into DeFi, and cementing Aave as the premier borrowing platform within this growing zk ecosystem. zkSync would benefit from having a flagship DeFi project like Aave on its platform, further diversifying and growing the DeFi options available to its users.\n\nContributing teams like the ACI have described this benefit well before: “EVM-equivalence allows deployment with little development work needed to adapt Aave to [a] new network.”\n\nAdditionally, ecosystem developers note “zkSync will further Aave’s expansion cross-chain, reinforcing Aave’s place as the top liquidity market.”\n\n## Specification\nThis TEMP CHECK presents the Aave governance with the opportunity to deploy Aave V3 on the zkSync Era Mainnet with a limited deployment of initial assets: USDC and ETH.\n\nSuggested risk parameters for these assets are provided in the table below.\n\nFlipside Crypto invites risk service providers ( such as @Pauljlei & @ChaosLabs) to provide feedback on these assets - as teams wait to confirm native or non-native versions of their token.\n\nWe hope this list grows as the network matures with more users and integrations:\n\n|Risk Parameter|WETH|USDC|\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|Isolation Mode|NO|NO|\n|Enable Borrow|NO|YES|\n|Enable Collateral|YES|YES|\n|Stable borrowing|N/A|NO|\n|Emode Category|N/A|N/A|\n|Loan To Value|80%|82.5%|\n|Liquidation Threshold|82.5%|85%|\n|Liquidation Bonus|5%|5%|\n|Reserve Factor|10%|10%|\n|Liquidation Protocol Fee|10%|10%|\n|Borrow Cap|N/A|10,000,000|\n|Supply Cap|25,000|25,000,000|\n|Debt Ceiling|N/A|N/A|\n|Base|0%|0%|\n|Slope1|7%|4%|\n|Uoptimal|45%|90%|\n\n## Disclaimer\nFlipside Crypto is not compensated in any form by zkSync or Matter Labs for creating this Temperature Check proposal. This TEMP CHECK has been prepared solely to facilitate community discussion.\n\n## Next Steps\n\n**ARFC**: If the Temperature Check Snapshot indicates positive sentiment, proceed to the ARFC stage for further discussion, risk parameter evaluation network analysis, and finalization of the proposal.\n\n**AIP**: If the ARFC stage Snapshot is successful, submit the proposal as an AIP for voting and on-chain governance approval.\n\n## Copyright\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.",

        "title": "[TEMP CHECK] Aave Chan Initiative 6-Month Budget Proposal",
        "author": "0x329c54289Ff5D6B7b7daE13592C6B1EDA1543eD4",
        "body": "## **Introduction**\n\nThe Aave Chan Initiative (ACI) is a delegate platform dedicated to actively participating in Aave governance and contributing to the protocol's success. As the Aave ecosystem matures, it is essential to have diverse and independent delegate platforms to drive the protocol forward.\n\nTo continue our efforts and effectively serve the Aave community, we are seeking a 6-month budget allocation. This budget will support our ongoing initiatives and enable us to expand our team and resources for maximum impact.\n\n## **ACI's current & future areas of focus**\n\n1. **Governance and AIP Development**\n    - Active participation in Aave governance discussions & votes\n    - Developing and submitting snapshot votes & AIPs\n    - Engaging with the community on forum discussions\n    - Collaborating with other delegates and stakeholders\n2. **Treasury Efficiency and Management**\n    - Collaborate with DAO service contributors, such as Llama, to enhance Aave DAO treasury management.\n    - Support initiatives and actively participate in efforts to improve treasury efficiency, led by Llama and other contributors.\n    - Drive the adoption of strategic investments, diversification, and risk mitigation in treasury allocation.\n    - Establish a cost-conscious culture and ensure responsible spending from the treasury for the benefit of the Aave protocol and its users.\n3. **Protocol and Ecosystem Development**\n    - Support the onboarding of new stablecoins, strategic assets, and LSDs\n    - Explore synergies with other DeFi platforms (e.g., Curve, Balancer, Arrakis)\n    - Promote the use of yield-bearing assets and LP tokens as collateral\n    - Participate in discussions around GHO and Safety Module improvements and advocate for “Real Yield” revenue for the Safety module paid in GHO\n    - Support the expansion of Aave markets in “new Frontiers” networks\n4. **Research and Analysis**\n    - Conduct in-depth research on DeFi trends and developments\n    - Provide insights and recommendations to the Aave community\n    - Analyze the performance and impact of Aave governance decisions\n    - Assess new risk mitigation strategies and techniques\n5. **Team Expansion and Operations**\n    - Grow the ACI team to support the Aave ecosystem better\n    - Cover operational expenses, including tools, subscriptions, and infrastructure\n    - Foster a collaborative environment for continuous learning and improvement\n    - Start a “Meta-Governance” focus for ACI. While the ACI can be considered “Aave-Maximalist,” there’s a lot of potential for having an active presence in other DeFi DAOs and representing Aave-DAO interest there, compared to other “professional” delegates, the laser-focus of ACI on Aave DAO interest will allow to have a voice focused on Aave synergies with other actors of the ecosystem.\n6. **Independence & Transparency**\n    - While the ACI grew to become the largest Aave DAO delegate platform, we are proud that our voting power originates from hundreds of individuals from the community that decided to trust the ACI with their voting and proposal power.\n   - To the best of our knowledge, the ACI voting & proposal power is not linked to any specific entity, Investment firm, or third-party protocol, allowing the ACI to remain 100% independent & focus on the benefit of the Aave protocol.\n   - The ACI firmly declined any form of third-party compensation for creating proposals & publishing AIPs as it would be against our independence ethos. The ACI works for the Aave DAO solely & uniquely.\n   - The ACI created & self-imposed mandatory disclosure on every proposal and will continue to support a transparency culture within the Aave DAO.\n\n## **Previous Work**\n\nHere are some notable achievements and contributions made by the Aave Chan Initiative:\n\n- **Governance Coordination**: The ACI actively supported governance participation & coordination; since the Launch of the ACI, exactly **ZERO** AIPs have failed to meet a 320k AAVE vote participation, while it was unfortunately common in 2022.\n- **AIPs**: The ACI presented and created numerous AIPs that have successfully been implemented to improve the Aave protocol. Since the Launch of the ACI, The AAVE DAO is now the most Active major DeFI DAO in the ecosystem. Q1 2023 was the most active quarter in terms of governance ever for Aave.\n    \n- **Governance improvement**: The ACI is actively involved in improving governance efficiency by providing the community with new frameworks, templates, fast-tracks & shortcuts to make Aave as efficient as possible.\n- **Delegators & contributor coordination:** The ACI actively worked with and supported other DAO delegates, contributors, community members & third-party actors by providing feedback on their proposals, technical support when needed, and doing numerous “co-authorship” synergies with other DAO actors.\n\n## **Requested Budget**\n\nWe are requesting a total budget of $250,000 for 6 months period to support our initiatives, team expansion, and operations. This budget will help us:\n\n- Sustainably continue our current work\n- Cover operational expenses, including tools, subscriptions, and infrastructure required to support our work\n- Grow the ACI team, allowing us to better serve the Aave community and expand our areas of focus. While the “One-Man Army” meme is fun, the current workload and ambitions for the future are not compatible with a single-person operation\n- Establish an active presence in other DeFi DAOs, representing Aave-DAO interests and exploring synergies with other actors in the ecosystem\n\nBy securing this budget, the Aave Chan Initiative will be in a sustainable position to continue to provide value to the Aave ecosystem.\n\n## **Next Steps**\n\nIf the TEMP CHECK is successful and the community supports our proposal, we will move forward with a formal ARFC submission detailing the proposal's specifics such as technical implementation of the proposal.\nWe commit to maintaining transparency throughout the process and regularly updating the community on our progress.\n\nThank you for considering our proposal. We appreciate your support and look forward to working together to drive the success of the Aave protocol.",
