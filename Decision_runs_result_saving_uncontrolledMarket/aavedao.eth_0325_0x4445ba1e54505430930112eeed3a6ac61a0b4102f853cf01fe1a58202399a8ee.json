        "body": "Discussion: \n\nhttps://governance.aave.com/t/arc-aave-deployment-to-bittorrent-chain-bttc/6813 \n\nSummary\n\nThe BitTorrent DAO Community asks for signaling from the Aave community to accept a deployment of the Aave Protocol into BitTorrent Chain (known as BTTC), which can expand lending to the BitTorrent community and, with the provision of incentives, bootstrap the launch of Aave on a new ecosystem.\n\nProposer\n\nBitTorrent Chain is an open-source, EVM-compatible blockchain that offers high concurrency, higher submission speed, lower transaction fees, and smoother operations. Since BTTC is fully-compatible with TRON, Ethereum, and Binance Smart Chain, users are able to transfer mainstream assets among TRON, Ethereum, and BSC in a decentralized manner. Openness and accessibility are core values that we practice through our cross-chain strategy, and we find that aligns well with Aave goals.\n\nWe seek to support Aave in its multichain expansion and invite Aave to enable the Aave v2 front-end for BTTC. We believe that BTTC is ready-made to support Aave: BTTC offers a secure infrastructure (multi-node validation), heterogeneous cross-chain solution, faster transaction confirmation (PoS consensus mechanism with an average block time between 2-3 seconds) , and lower transaction fees (<$0.01 on average).\n\nAs the Layer 2 of TRON, BTTC inherits the advanced technology and resources from TRON, as well as $1.1bn TRON Ecosystem Fund. Since TRON’s MainNet release on May 31, 2018, TRON has risen to become the world’s fastest-growing public chain and the world’s largest network in terms of stablecoin settlement. Currently TRON boasts a staggering $70 billion worth of assets, over 66 million TRON accounts, and more than 39.9 billion TRC20-USDT in circulation on its network.\n\nMoreover, BTTC integrates with Binance Smart Chain, which has one of the strongest deflationary mechanisms and currently has more daily active addresses than the rest of all layer 1s combined. That compatibility makes BTTC a better fit for DeFi applications like Aave.\n\nWe are convinced that BTTC is key to ushering in an era of connecting all chains, helping achieve rapid growth across the DeFi space, especially the Aave community.\n\nRationale\n\nCurrent status of the BitTorrent Chain\n\nBitTorrent Chain’s vision is to provide a high-performance, highly scalable, low-cost solution for blockchain platforms that delivers a superior user experience for decentralized applications without sacrificing decentralization while leveraging the existing developer ecosystem.\n\nBTTC is scalable to tens or hundreds of thousands of participants due to the performance of consensus. As the first heterogeneous cross-chain interoperability protocol in the industry, users can transfer assets within TRON, Ethereum, BSC without any limits. The PoS consensus network can deal with high throughput and provides instant finality in 2-3 seconds, making the network an incredible homecourt for DeFi and other EVM applications.\n\nWhy is it good for the Aave ecosystem?\n\nBTTC is well-suited for building DeFi applications due to scalability, high throughput, economic, and instant finality. The BitTorrent DAO Community has allocated up to $1bn for users of the Aave protocol. This program will bring new users to the platform, and reach more users from the established TRON community. Having the Aave community embrace deployment on BTTC will allow more users to access Aave’s offerings across the DeFi ecosystem.\n\nThere is great potential for synergy between BTTC and Aave. As a close partner of TRON, BTTC will be able to contribute more than $1bn on Aave, and there are already more than $800mn assets of BTTC community on the Aave. The TRON DeFi ecosystem is thriving: Total Value Locked across TRON DeFi protocols is $5.39bn and growing. Many well-known protocols such as JustLend, Sunswap, amongst others, have deployed on TRON. On BTTC, Aave would find many users eager to participate in lending markets and add value to the Aave network.\n\nBesides, as BTTC integrates more mainstream public chains like BSC, it will ease down the process of interacting between users and Aave, and that will definitely catapult the Aave ecosystem to the next level.\n\nWhy is signaling necessary?\n\nConsistent with the ethos of the Aave ecosystem, we believe that all deployments of the Aave protocol should be voted on–and accepted by – Aave governance prior to deployment. Deploying the Aave protocol on BTTC will support growth and synergies between the communities, ultimately leading to a stronger DeFi ecosystem.\n\nReference: \nHomepage: https://bt.io/\nGithub: https://github.com/bttcprotocol\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/BitTorrent\nMedium: https://medium.com/@BitTorrent\nTelegram: https://t.me/BitTorrentChain\n\n\n",

        "body": "---\n\nTitle: [TEMP CHECK] Add PYUSD to Aave v3 Ethereum Market \n\nAuthor: [@mv_Trident]\n\nCreated: 2023-12-18\n\n---\n\n# Summary\n\nThis AIP proposes the onboarding of the PYUSD stablecoin, minted by Paxos Trust Company, into the Aave V3 Ethereum pool.\n\n# Motivation\n\nPYUSD is a USD-pegged stablecoin minted through Paxos. While it’s still young, it has grown to a circulating supply of over $230M with strong peg resilience. Onboarding this asset into Aave will:\n\n- Build synergies between Aave and PYUSD.\n- Offer Aave users an additional stablecoin option.\n- Strengthen the relationship between the PYUSD & the GHO stablecoin. (Trident may explore the deployment of a PYUSD/GHO pool)\n\nWe propose a PYUSD onboarding outside isolation mode but without collateral properties.\n\nIf the community deems that PYUSD as collateral is immediately viable we stand ready to support that role on day one; otherwise following PYUSD maturity, the Aave governance can propose a collateral activation for PYUSD at a later stage.\n\n# Specification\n\nTicker: PYUSD\nContract address: [0x6c3ea9036406852006290770bedfcaba0e23a0e8])https://etherscan.io/token/0x6c3ea9036406852006290770bedfcaba0e23a0e8)\nPrice Feed: [0x8f1df6d7f2db73eece86a18b4381f4707b918fb1](https://etherscan.io/address/0x8f1df6d7f2db73eece86a18b4381f4707b918fb1)\n\nChainlink Oracle: [https://data.chain.link/ethereum/mainnet/stablecoins/PYUSD-usd](https://data.chain.link/ethereum/mainnet/stablecoins/pyusd-usd)\n\nWe propose the following parameters for a PYUSD onboarding:\n\nParameter\tValue\nIsolation Mode\tNo\nBorrowable\tYes\nCollateral Enabled\tNo\nSupply Cap (PYUSD)\t25M\nBorrow Cap (PYUSD)\t20M\nDebt Ceiling\tN/A\nLTV\tN/A\nLT\tN/A\nLiquidation Bonus\tN/A\nLiquidation Protocol Fee\t10.00%\nVariable Base\t0.00%\nVariable Slope1\t7.00%\nVariable Slope2\t80.00%\nUoptimal\t80.00%\nReserve Factor\t10.00%\nStable Borrowing\tDisabled\nStable Slope1\t13.00%\nStable Slope2\t300.00%\nBase Stable Rate Offset\t3.00%\nStable Rate Excess Offset\t8.00%\nOptimal Stable To Total Debt Ratio\t20.00%\nFlashloanable\tNo\nSiloed Borrowing\tNo\nBorrowed in Isolation\tNo\n\n*Liquidity and Market Cap*\n\nThe PYUSD token was introduced a few months ago, and since its launch, its market cap has increased to approximately $230million. Over the coming weeks the pool will be scaled further with incentives in order to reach the necessary liquidity to support the proposed market parameters.\n\n![PayPal USD Price Chart.png](ipfs://bafkreihqq36bcffddfsnmcz4m4gda4pcopqktjs4rdneanq4q4pggkesfm)\n    \nWhen analyzing market cap and trading volumes of assets for listing, we look at the available historical data. The 30 Day average Market Cap of PYUSD is $170M with a 30 day average volume of $4.7M. Over the last 7 days, the average Market cap has climbed to $209M with the same period seeing an average volume of $8.7M, the volume and aum increase is on the back of prior stakeholder efforts and we expect both to grow meaningfully in the coming weeks.\n\n \n![coming weeks.png](ipfs://bafkreifqcajvizwsxvoiinqyppnncfzmdqk56dirdnwlfolhlwamonktva)\n    \n\nWith peg holding well since inception, an average intra-day volatility of ~0.01%, and the ability of onboarded institutional investors to redeem PYUSD 1:1 with Paxos, we see low risk related to the stability of PYUSD’s price.\n\n*Initial Supply and Borrow Caps*\n\nPYUSD circulating supply is ~$230M. Given PYUSD is a new asset listing, we recommend adopting a conservative approach for setting supply and borrow caps for PYUSD, which gives room to expand caps should cap usage be elevated. We recommend a supply cap of 25M and a borrow cap of 20M.\n\n*Variable Borrow Rate*\n\nWe recommend setting slope 1 to 7% due to current on-chain stable yield opportunities which we believe will remain viable for the foreseeable future.\n\n*Borrowable in Isolation*\n\nWe do not see excess risk with enabling PYUSD being borrowable in isolation. If the community wishes to take a more conservative stance, it may wish to only limit PYUSD borrowing to non-isolated collateral.\n\n# Next Steps:\n\n1. Gather community feedback on this TEMP CHECK.\n2. If consensus is reached, escalate this proposal to TEMP CHECK snapshot stage.\n3. If TEMP CHECK snapshot outcome is YAE, escalate to ARFC stage.\n4. If consensus on ARFC stage is reached and risk service providers provide feedback on risk parameters, escalate to ARFC snapshot stage.\n5. If ARFC snapshot stage outcome is YAE, escalate to AIP stage\n\n#Disclosure\n@mv_Trident works with [Trident](https://www.tridig.io/) who has been contracted by Paxos in order to improve the on-chain liquidity and utility of its issued assets.\nThis TEMP CHECK is powered by Skywards.\nThe Aave Chan Initiative has not received any form of compensation from Trident Team for creating this proposal.\n\nCopyright\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0 .",
