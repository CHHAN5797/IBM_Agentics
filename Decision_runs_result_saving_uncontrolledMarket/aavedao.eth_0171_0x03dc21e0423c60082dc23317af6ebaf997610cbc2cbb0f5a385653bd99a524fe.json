This follows the original plans for further expansion on the network.\n\n### **Motivation**\n\nThe integration of sUSDe, USDe, and weETH into Aave v3 on zkSync is following the intitial plan for the zkSync network launch. With the successful launch of Aave v3 on zkSync, and some time for monitoring, we believe it is time to start expanding from the initial asset list. \n\nThese onboardings also include partnership with Ethena and EtherFi to add ZK token incentives to each market, which will contribute to Aave’s growth on zkSync.\n\n### **Proof of Liquidity and Deposit Commitments**\n\nAave DAO received an allocation of ZK during the network’s TGE. Ethena and EtherFi have both pledged to add additional incentives from their own ZK token allocations. These incentives will be used to grow the market with ACI acting as Emissions Manager.\n\n### **Specification**\n\n> Risk Parameters have been provided by Risk Service Providers and this ARFC has been updated based on their assessment. 2024-10-04\n\n| **Parameter** | weETH | USDe | sUSDe |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Isolation Mode | No | Yes | Yes |\n| Borrowable | Yes | Yes | No |\n| Collateral Enabled | Yes | Yes | Yes |\n| Supply Cap | 300 | 500,000 | 400,000 |\n| Borrow Cap | 150 | 50,000 | - |\n| Debt Ceiling | - | $500,000 | $400,000 |\n| LTV | 72.5% | 65% | 65% |\n| LT | 75% | 75% | 75% |\n| Liquidation Bonus | 7.5% | 8.5% | 8.5% |\n| Liquidation Protocol Fee | 10% | 10% | 10% |\n| Variable Base | 0% | 0% | - |\n| Variable Slope1 | 7% | 9% | - |\n| Variable Slope2 | 300% | 75% | - |\n| Uoptimal | 30% | 80% | - |\n| Reserve Factor | 45% | 25% | 20% |\n| Stable Borrowing | Disabled | Disabled | Disabled |\n| Flashloanable | Yes | Yes | Yes |\n| Siloed Borrowing | Disabled | Disabled | Disabled |\n| Borrowable in Isolation | No | No | No |\n| E-Mode Category | ETH-correlated | - | - |\n\n### **Disclaimer**\n\nThis proposal is powered by Skywards. ACI is not directly affiliated with Ethena or EtherFi and did not receive compensation for creation this proposal. ACI is a delegate in EtherFi. ACI and its members hold weETH.\n\n**Next Steps**\n\n1. If consensus is reached on this [ARFC], escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n2. If the ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, publish an AIP vote for final confirmation and enforcement of the proposal\n\n### **Copyright**\n\nCopyright and related rights waived under [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)",

This ARFC proposal suggests that Aave supports Lido Alliance efforts by deploying a new Aave V3 ETH market for Lido. This Aave v3 instance will be designed and tuned to support stETH leverage loopers. The deployment will only include wstETH and wETH assets with E-Mode enabled.\n\nLido has committed incentive programs and ecosystem support for this instance in order to bootstrap liquidity and promote additional programs within the Lido Alliance.\n\nThis market will be bootstrapped with wETH from the Ahab program to attract wETH liquidity.\n\nwETH suppliers will also be proposed to be eligible to a dedicated Merit Boost\n\nIncentives from Lido will be detailed ahead of the AIP deployment. \n\n## Specification\n\nThe Lido Alliance’s Aave v3 instance implements the following:\n\n- The borrow cap of wETH will be set to 90% of supplied wETH, with updates tightly controlled by the risk steward. This will ensure that stETH/wETH loops are consistently profitable and can't go into negative territory.\n- E-Mode LTV & LT are set 50 bps above all other Aave implementations, making it the most efficient loop venue in the industry.\n- For the first 6 months of the Lido Alliance Aave v3, wETH slope1 will be set at 2.50%, ((currently 2.7% on mainnet and on L2s) and wETH RF set at 10% (currently 15% on all markets). This will make it the most profitable venue to loop stETH & wETH.\n- wstETH RF will be 5%.\n\nThe deployment of the Aave V3 Lido Ecosystem Aave will be done by Catapulta on behalf of the Aave DAO.\n\n|Parameter|wstETH value|wETH value|\n|---|---|---|\n|Isolation Mode|No|No|\n|Borrowable|Yes|Yes|\n|Collateral Enabled|Yes|Yes|\n|Supply Cap|650K|900K|\n|Borrow Cap|12k|810K|\n|Debt Ceiling|NA|NA|\n|LTV|80.00%|82.00%|\n|LT|81.00%|83.00%|\n|Liquidation Bonus|6%|5%|\n|Liquidation Protocol Fee|10.00%|10.00%|\n|Variable Base|0.0%|0.0%|\n|Variable Slope1|3.5%|2.50%|\n|Variable Slope2|85%|85%|\n|Uoptimal|45%|90%|\n|Reserve Factor|5.00%|10%|\n|Stable Borrowing|Disabled|Disabled|\n|Flahloanable|Yes|Yes|\n|Siloed Borrowing|No|No|\n|Borrowed in Isolation|No|No|\n|E-Mode|Yes|Yes|\n|E-Mode LTV|93.5%|93.5%|\n|E-Mode LT|95.5%|95.5%|\n|E-mode Liquidation Bonus|1%|1 %|\n\n## **Useful Links:**\n\nLido Alliance proposal: https://research.lido.fi/t/lido-alliance-an-ethereum-aligned-ecosystem/7475\n\n https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-deploy-a-lido-aave-v3-instance/17930\n\n## Disclaimer:\n\nThe Aave Chan Initiative is not directly affiliated with Lido and did not receive compensation for creating this proposal.

Liquidity Enhancement: The inclusion of this widely-used stablecoin is expected to boost liquidity in the Lido Instance, potentially attracting more users and increasing overall platform activity.\n3. Strategic Alignment: This move aligns with Aave’s goal of offering a comprehensive suite of high-quality assets, keeping the protocol at the forefront of DeFi liquidity.\n\n### **Proof of Liquidity and Deposit Commitments**\n\nFRAX has pledged liquidity provision support. These will complement the ongoing incentives for the Lido Instance.\n\n### **Specification**\n\nContract addresses:\n\nFRAX: 0x853d955aCEf822Db058eb8505911ED77F175b99e\n\n> ARFC has been updated with Risk Parameters provided by Risk Service Providers 2024-10-08\n\n| **Parameter** | FRAX |\n| --- | --- |\n| Chain-Instance | Ethereum-Lido |\n| Isolation Mode | No |\n| Borrowable | Yes |\n| Collateral Enabled | No |\n| Supply Cap | 20,000,000 |\n| Borrow Cap | 18,000,000 |\n| Debt Ceiling | - |\n| LTV | - |\n| LT | - |\n| Liquidation Bonus | - |\n| Liquidation Protocol Fee | - |\n| Variable Base | 0% |\n| Variable Slope1 | 5.5% |\n| Variable Slope2 | 75% |\n| Uoptimal | 90% |\n| Reserve Factor | 20% |\n| Stable Borrowing | Disabled |\n| Flashloanable | Yes |\n| Siloed Borrowing | Disabled |\n| Borrowable in Isolation | No |\n| E-Mode Category | - |\n\n### **Disclaimer:**\n\nThis proposal is powered by Skywards.
