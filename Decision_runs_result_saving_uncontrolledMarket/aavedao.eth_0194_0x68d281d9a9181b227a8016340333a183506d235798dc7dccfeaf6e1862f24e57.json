In addition, anyone who deposits weETH into Aave will accumulate [ether.fi](http://ether.fi/) and EigenLayer points to be used for future incentives.\n\n### **Motivation**\n\nThis move is intended to improve asset diversity on Aave and increase liquidity in the ecosystem.\n\n[ether.fi](http://ether.fi) is the first decentralized, non-custodial delegated staking protocol with an LRT (eETH). One of the distinguishing characteristics of [ether.fi](http://ether.fi) is that stakers control their keys. Those who work on the protocol strive for the following:\n\n1. Decentralization is the primary objective. [ether.fi](http://ether.fi) will never compromise on the non-custodial and decentralized nature of the protocol. Stakers must maintain control of their ETH.\n2. The [ether.fi](http://ether.fi) protocol is a real business with a sustainable revenue model. The team is in this for the long haul. No ponzinomics f*ckery.\n3. [ether.fi](http://ether.fi) will do the right thing for the Ethereum community, always. If and when the team messes up, [ether.fi](http://ether.fi) will own it and course correct quickly.\n\n**Staking Primitives**\n\n[ether.fi](http://ether.fi) is working to advance innovation in the space by incorporating staking primitives that reward users and uphold values of decentralization. Distributed Validator Technology (DVT) is a core feature of Operation Solo Staker, an initiative that [ether.fi](http://ether.fi) helped launch in April 2023. Along with Obol Labs, dappnode and Avado, [ether.fi](http://ether.fi) assisted with the first instance of a solo staker cluster using DVT on Mainnet in August 2023. More recently, [ether.fi](http://ether.fi) became the first LSP to natively restake on EigenLayer.\n\n**Tokenomics & Governance**\n\neETH is an LRT that allows users to stake their ETH, accrue staking rewards, and receive additional rewards through native restaking on EigenLayer. As of February 3rd, approximately 290,310 ETH ($670M) in TVL has been deposited into the [ether.fi](http://ether.fi) protocol, and XX has been natively restaked in EigenLayer.\n\nUsers are given eETH on a 1:1 basis with a minimum deposit of 0.001 ETH. As mentioned above, [ether.fi](http://ether.fi) is also the first LSP to natively restake on EigenLayer — a move that helps improve network efficiency and provides stakers with additional rewards for their network contributions. [ether.fi](http://ether.fi) has also launched a series of partnerships with DeFi protocols to incentivize users and drive liquidity (weETH) to various platforms.\n\nThe goal of [ether.fi](http://ether.fi) is to make all aspects of the protocol 100% open sourced and ossify the smart contracts to prevent them from being upgraded. The protocol will eventually be governed by a DAO, and those who work on [ether.fi](http://ether.fi) have also committed to self-limiting the amount of ETH staked on the protocol to 25% of the total amount of ETH staked on the Beacon Chain.\n\n**Points System**\n\n[Ether.fi](http://Ether.fi) has amassed a following by offering users points based on their activity. Those who stake with [ether.fi](http://ether.fi) have the opportunity to earn both [ether.fi](http://ether.fi) and EigenLayer points that will be used for future incentives.\n\n**On-chain Metrics**\n\n* As of February 3rd, 2024\n* Total Value Locked (TVL): $669,826,357 (290,310.46 ETH)\n* 24-hr trading volume (TV): $4,051,395\n* Max daily deposit: 24,489 ETH (January 25, 2024)\n* Unique eETH holders: 49,858\n* Daily max weETH pools TV: Pendle ($10.33m), Curve ($811.70k), Uniswap ($1.88m), Balancer ($239.66k), Maverick ($4.18m) (January 29, 2024)\n\nYou can view additional [ether.fi](http://ether.fi) stats on [Dune](https://dune.com/ether_fi/etherfi).\n\n**Risk mitigation**\n\n[ether.fi](http://ether.fi)’s LRT eETH is 100% redeemable. Users who deposit ETH into the protocol can withdraw their stake at any time. The holdings are publicly auditable on-chain and the protocol retains healthy reserves to offset any losses.\n\n### Specification\n\n[Ether.fi site](https://www.ether.fi/)\n\nContract Address: [0x35fa164735182de50811e8e2e824cfb9b6118ac2](https://etherscan.io/token/0xcd5fe23c85820f7b72d0926fc9b05b43e359b7ee)\n\n### **Useful Links:**\n\n### Disclaimer:\n\nThis proposal is powered by Skywards.

If consensus is reached on this [TEMP CHECK], escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n2. If the Snapshot outcome is YAE, this proposal will be escalated to ARFC stage\n3. Publication of a standard ARFC, collect community & service providers feedback before escalating proposal to ARFC snapshot stage\n4. If the ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, publish an AIP vote for final confirmation and enforcement of the proposal\n\n### Copyright:\n\nCopyright and related rights waived under [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)",

        "body": "## [ARFC]  Add rsETH to Aave V3 Ethereum\n\n## Author: ACI (Aave Chan Initiative)\n\n## Date: 2024-08-12\n---\n\n> ARFC has been updated with Risk Parameters provided by both Risk Service Providers after having reservations with exchange rate oracles. 2024-08-12\n\n### **Summary**\n\n[Kelp DAO](https://www.kelpdao.xyz/) is seeking community support for adding its Liquid Restaking Token, rsETH, to Aave V3 on Ethereum. In addition, rsETH depositors into Aave will accumulate additional [Kelp miles](https://www.kelpdao.xyz/dashboard/) and EigenLayer points.\n\n### **Motivation**\n\n**KelpDAO** (https://www.kelpdao.xyz/restake/) is one of the largest liquid restaking protocol built on top of the Eigen Layer. Restakers on Kelp get access to multiple benefits like restaking rewards, staking rewards and DeFi yields.\n\n**Latest stats**:\n\n- USD 800 Mn+ (~270k Eth) TVL\n- 20K+ restakers onboarded\n- Accepts ETHx, stETH, sfrxETH, and Native ETH as collateral\n- Live across mainnet and L2s such as Arbitrum and Polygon zkEVM\n\nKelpDAO has undergone multiple security audits by top tier audit firms including Sigma Prime, Code4rena. More about KelpDAO’s security here: [Kelp DAO Audit reports](https://kelp.gitbook.io/kelp/audits).\n\nThe motivation for this proposal is to introduce a new asset class LRT (Liquid restaking tokens) to Aave and add to the diversity of LST/ LRT category.\n\n**Restaking Innovation**\n\nKelpDAO’s innovation in the restaking ecosystem has been focused on bringing about the following benefits to users and services-\n\n- Restakers\n    - Liqudity for restaked assets (stETH, ETHx, sfrxETH and Native ETH)\n    - Access to additional staking rewards\n    - Participate in DeFi using rsETH\n- AVSs\n    - Bootstrap economic security\n    - Lowered incentive spends\n- Operators\n    - Higher revenue earning potential\n    - Service onboarding and community support\n    - Marketing for node delegation\n\n### Specification\n\n*> Risk Parameters have been provided by Risk Service Providers on 2024-08-09 and ARFC has been updated.* It is recommended listing rsETH using an exchange rate oracle. \n\n\n| Parameter | Value |\n| --- | --- |\n| Isolation Mode | No |\n| Borrowable | Yes |\n| Collateral Enabled | Yes |\n| Supply Cap | 19,000 |\n| Borrow Cap | 1,900 |\n| Debt Ceiling | - |\n| LTV | 72% |\n| LT | 75% |\n| Liquidation Penalty | 7.5% |\n| Liquidation Protocol Fee | 10.00% |\n| Variable Base | 0.0% |\n| Variable Slope1 | 7.00% |\n| Variable Slope2 | 300.00% |\n| Uoptimal | 45.00% |\n| Reserve Factor | 15.00% |\n| Stable Borrowing | Disabled |\n| Flashloanable | Yes |\n| Siloed Borrowing | No |\n| Borrowable in Isolation | No |\n| E-Mode Category | ETH-Correlated |\n\n### CAPO\n\n| maxYearlyRatioGrowthPercent | ratioReferenceTime | MINIMUM_SNAPSHOT_DELAY |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 9.83% | monthly | 14 days |\n\n\nDetailed explanation on Kelp’s technical architecture - [Technical Architecture - Kelp](https://kelp.gitbook.io/kelp/technical-architecture)\n\nKelpDAO will have its own token $Kelp that will be the main governance token of Kelp protocol. Kelp token holders will be able to participate in governance related matters including Whitelisting/ delisting of Assets, Node operators, AVS’, setting and updating fees for Kelp protocol.\n\nKelp’s on-chain stats can be viewed on [Dune](https://dune.com/kelp_dao/dashboard-catalogue).\n\n**Liquidity Pools for rsETH**\n\nFollowing are liquidity stats for rsETH:\n\n- rsETH has >55 Mn USD liquidity across several DEXs on the mainnet including\n    - [Balancer](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0x58aadfb1afac0ad7fca1148f3cde6aedf5236b6d00000000000000000000067f) - $38 Mn\n    - [Uniswap V3](https://app.uniswap.org/explore/pools/ethereum/0x059615EBf32C946aaab3D44491f78e4F8e97e1D3) - $12.42 Mn\n    - [Balancer](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0x7761b6e0daa04e70637d81f1da7d186c205c2ade00000000000000000000065d) - $5 Mn\n    - Few others\n- ~$10 Mn+ average daily trading volume (Last 7 days on 12th May)\n\n**Oracles**:\n\nrsETH is supported by Chainlink and Redstone oracles. Posted links below to the Oracle contracts:\n\nChainlink calculated price feed: https://etherscan.io/address/0x78C12ccE8346B936117655Dd3D70a2501Fd3d6e6\n\nChainlink market feed: https://data.chain.link/feeds/ethereum/mainnet/rseth-eth\n\nRedstone market feed:\n\n[https://app.redstone.finance/tokens#/app/token/rsETH\\\\\\\\ETH](https://app.redstone.finance/tokens#/app/token/rsETH%5C%5C%5C%5CETH)\n\n**rsETH exchange rate mechanism:**\n\nrsETH exchange rate is defined based on the underlying assets and rewards generated by those assets.\n\nAccepted assets include ETH, stETH, ETHx, sfrxETH.\n\nExchange rate calculation -\n\nA → Total ETH + Staking rewards accumulated from the chain\n\nB → [Amount of ETHx] * [Value of 1 ETHx in ETH]\n\nC → [Amount of sfrxETH] * [Value of 1 sfrxETH in ETH]\n\nD → [Amount of stETH] * [Value of 1 stETH in ETH]\n\nE → Total supply of rsETH\n\nExchange rate (rsETH / ETH) = [A + B + C + D] / E\n\n**Withdrawals and risks**\n\nPrior to this ARFC, the only way to exit rsETH was via DEXs. \n\nNevertheless, KelpDAO users can now unstake rsETH, with an unbonding period of 7 to 8 days, due to Eigenlayer withdrawal period. That also means that any of the LST’s including stETH, ETHx or sfrxETH from Eigenlayer can be unstaked as well.\n\n### Proof of Liquidity and Deposit Commitments:\n\nAnyone who deposits rsETH into Aave will accumulate additional [Kelp miles](https://www.kelpdao.xyz/dashboard/) and EigenLayer points.\n\n### **Useful Links:**\n\n* [KelpDAO’s Dapp](https://www.kelpdao.xyz/)\n* Contract Address:[ 0xA1290d69c65A6Fe4DF752f95823fae25cB99e5A7](https://etherscan.io/token/0xA1290d69c65A6Fe4DF752f95823fae25cB99e5A7)\n* [GitHub Docs](https://kelp.gitbook.io/kelp)\n\n### Disclaimer:\n\nThis proposal is powered by Skywards.

        "body": "---\n### [TEMP CHECK] Onboard osGNO to Aave v3 Gnosis\n### Author: ACI\n###  Date: 2024-07-29\n---\n\n### **Summary**\n\nThis proposal aims to Onboard osGNO, the Liquid Staking Token (LST) of StakeWise V3 into the GnosisMarket. By integrating osGNO, Aave users will be provided with additional liquidity and yield opportunities while supporting the growth of LSTs within the DeFi ecosystem on Gnosis Chain.\n\n### **Motivation**\n\nGNO is used for governance within the GnosisDAO and acts as a staking token for Gnosis Chain. \n\nosGNO is a Liquid Staking Token (LST) representing GNO staked in StakeWise V3 on Gnosis Chain. It can be minted from any Vault created in StakeWise on Gnosis in order to make a user’s stake liquid. Users have the option of staking in one of the Vaults in the Marketplace to mint osGNO, creating their own Vault as a solo staker and minting osGNO from there, or purchasing osGNO directly on a DEX.\n\nCreating Vaults and staking in them is a permissionless process on StakeWise, and so is access to osGNO. For additional protection, every minted osGNO has an excess backing of staked tokens, provided by the minters themselves.  \n\nosGNO increases in value relative to GNO as staking rewards accrue, it can be redeemed for the underlying GNO within Vaults using the redemption mechanism detailed [here](https://docs.stakewise.io/protocol-overview-in-depth/oseth#redemption-mechanism). If there are not sufficient liquid reserves available for redemption, there may be delays in unstaking and redeeming the osGNO for underlying GNO which could result in a temporary depeg.\n\nosETH was recently added as collateral on Aave v3 Ethereum and has seen good adoption. In order to improve Aave’s marketshare on Gnosis Cchain, and support the Gnosis and StakeWise ecosystems it is proposed to also Onboard osGNO into Gnosis Market.\n\n### **Proof of Liquidity and Deposit Commitments**\n\nPotential POL and Deposit Commitments will be discussed at ARFC stage.\n\n### **Specification**\n\nContract address: 0xF490c80aAE5f2616d3e3BDa2483E30C4CB21d1A0\n\nRisk Parameters will be provided at ARFC Stage by Risk Service Providers.\n\n### **Useful Links:**\n\nosGNO announcement post: https://stakewise.medium.com/announcing-the-launch-of-stakewise-v3-on-gnosis-chain-0231285bd8e3\n\nosGNO Vaults: https://app.stakewise.io/vaults\n\n### **Disclaimer:**\n\nThis proposal is powered by Skywards. ACI is not directly affiliated with StakeWise and did not receive compensation for creation this proposal.\n\nACI and some ACI team members are holders of GNO.\n\n### **Next Steps**\n\n1. If consensus is reached on this [TEMP CHECK], escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n2. If the Snapshot outcome is YAE, this proposal will be escalated to ARFC stage\n3. Publication of a standard ARFC, collect community & service providers feedback before escalating proposal to ARFC snapshot stage\n4. If the ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, publish an AIP vote for final confirmation and enforcement of the proposal\n\n### **Copyright:**\n\nCopyright and related rights waived under [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)",

This is a logical extension of the work Steakhouse is doing as Lido DAO’s Finance Workstream, and is a work in progress proof of the crucial role that Lido stETH can play in helping restaking become more efficient, while preserving the decentralization of Ethereum.\n\nThe onboarding of steakLRT to the Aave v3 Lido instance aims to enhance the diversity and robustness of the Aave ecosystem by integrating a novel restaking token. \n\nsteakLRT, built on Mellow and Symbiotic, brings unique value propositions and additional yield opportunities through boosted points programs. By including steakLRT, we can continue to attract user deposits from restaking narratives and support the further growth of a Lido instance. Further, beacuse steakLRT accepts wstETH deposits, there are strategic programs that can be run to increase wstETH deposit yield through looping strategies and liquidity mining. These will continue to make the Aave v3 Lido Instance the best place to deposit wstETH as collateral. \n\n### **Proof of Liquidity and Deposit Commitments**\n\nMellow and Symbiotic deposits held as LRTs like steakLRT earn Symbiotic and Mellow points. \n\nMellow will do an additional boosted points program for deposits into the Aave v3 Lido instance. \n\n### **Specification**\n\nContract address: [0xbeef69ac7870777598a04b2bd4771c71212e6abc](https://etherscan.io/address/0xbeef69ac7870777598a04b2bd4771c71212e6abc)\n\nRisk Parameters will be provided at ARFC Stage by Risk Service Providers.\n\n### **Useful Links:**\n\nsteakLRT announcement post: https://hackmd.io/@SteakhouseFi/steakLRT\n\nsteakLRT Mellow Vault: https://app.mellow.finance/restake/ethereum-steaklrt\n\n### **Disclaimer:**\n\nThis proposal is powered by Skywards.

As productive assets, staking tokens are high quality collateral to borrow against.\n\nGiven their high correlation to ETH, LRTs are commonly used as collateral to borrow ETH and engage in yield leveraged staking, with several communities having built products that automate such strategies on top of Aave. The introduction of eMode only made such strategies more popular.\n\nThe onboarding of ezETH will consequently create increased ezETH demand and increased revenues for both Aave and Renzo Protocol, whilst also bolstering the liquidity and peg stability of ezETH.\n\n## **Chain to be deployed/listed**\n\nEthereum mainnet.\n\n## **Relevant KPI & Points Rewards**\n\nRenzo awards ezPoints and EigenLayer Restaked Points based on users’ ezETH holdings. Every user that deposits ezETH as collateral in Aave will also be awarded ezPoints and EigenLayer points 1:1.\n\nAs relevant KPI for the Protocol:\n\n- Total Value Locked: $1.9 billion\n\n- Total supply: 526K+ Renzo Restaked ETH\n\n- 24H trading volume: $80,203,780\n\n## **Useful Links**\n\n[Renzo Protocol](https://www.renzoprotocol.com/)\n\n[Documentation](https://docs.renzoprotocol.com/docs)\n\n[Github](https://github.com/Renzo-Protocol)\n\n[Audits](https://github.com/Renzo-Protocol/contracts-public/blob/master/Audit/Renzo_Protocol_EVM_Contracts_Smart_Contract_Security_Assessment.pdf)\n\n[Chainlink Data Feed](https://data.chain.link/feeds/ethereum/mainnet/ezeth-eth)\n\n[Composable Stable Pool](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0x596192bb6e41802428ac943d2f1476c1af25cc0e000000000000000000000659)\n\n## **Disclaimer**\n\nThe Aave-chan Initiative is not presenting this TEMP CHECK on behalf of any third party and is not compensated by Renzo Protocol for creating this proposal.\n\n## **Next Steps**\n\n1. If consensus is reached on this [TEMP CHECK], escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n2. If the Snapshot outcome is YAE, this proposal will be escalated to ARFC stage\n3. Publication of a standard ARFC, collect community & service providers feedback before escalating proposal to ARFC snapshot stage\n4. If the ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, publish an AIP vote for final confirmation and enforcement of the proposal\n\n## **Copyright**\n\nCopyright and related rights waived under [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",
