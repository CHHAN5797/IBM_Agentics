        "body": "## Simple Summary\n\nA proposal to adjust five (5) total risk parameters, including LTV, Liquidation Threshold, and Liquidation Bonus across four (4) Aave V2 assets. \n\n## Abstract\nThis proposal is a batch update of risk parameters to align with the [Moderate risk level](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/QmT9T4Rfnh1Z2HYmMPXvtFotMK2vSxiXK8dKStg2b6n4gi) chosen by the Aave community. These parameter updates are a continuation of Gauntlet's regular parameter recommendations.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\n\nThis set of parameter updates seeks to maintain the overall risk tolerance of the protocol while making risk trade-offs between specific assets.\n\nGauntlet's parameter recommendations are driven by an optimization function that balances 3 core metrics: insolvencies, liquidations, and borrow usage. Parameter recommendations seek to optimize for this objective function. Our agent-based simulations use a wide array of varied input data that changes on a daily basis (including but not limited to asset volatility, asset correlation, asset collateral usage, DEX / CEX liquidity, trading volume, expected market impact of trades, and liquidator behavior). Gauntlet's simulations tease out complex relationships between these inputs that cannot be simply expressed as heuristics. As such, the input metrics we show below can help understand why some of the param recs have been made but should not be taken as the only reason for recommendation. The individual collateral pages on the [Gauntlet Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/aave) cover other key statistics and outputs from our simulations that can help with understanding interesting inputs and results related to our simulations. \n\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/KyHcQWS.png)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/s0gAXAE.png)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/9uV45Nk.png)\n\nFor more details, please see [Gauntlet's Parameter Recommendation Methodology](https://medium.com/gauntlet-networks/gauntlets-parameter-recommendation-methodology-8591478a0c1c) and [Gauntlet's Model Methodology](https://medium.com/gauntlet-networks/gauntlets-model-methodology-ea150ff0bafd). \n\n\n**Top SNX non-recursive supplies and collateralization ratios:**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/zw1Q12L.png)\n\n**Top STETH non-recursive supplies and collateralization ratios:**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/kGz9tM3.png)\n\n**Top UNI non-recursive supplies and collateralization ratios:**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/fjcsOec.png)\n\n**Top USDC non-recursive supplies and collateralization ratios:**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/B2c4b68.png)\n\n\n\n## Specification\n\n\nOur recent [market downturn report](https://governance.aave.com/t/market-risk-monthly-february-2022-updates-and-review/7476) showed that many collaterals are resilient to insolvencies, as our simulation models have predicted. We will continue to adjust risk parameters to drive increases in capital efficiency while maintaining protocol risk at safe levels. \n\n\n\n\n| Parameter | Current Value | Recommended Value |\n| -------- | -------- | -------- |\n| SNX Loan To Value     | 45%     | 49%     |\n| STETH Loan To Value     | 70%     | 73%     |\n| UNI Liquidation Bonus    | 7.5%     | 9.0%     |\n| UNI Liquidation Threshold    | 70%     | 75%     |\n| USDC Liquidation Threshold    | 86%     | 88%     |\n\n\n\nSee below volatility and exchange volume data from 03/31 to 04/20. These are valuable metrics to build intuition but are not the only inputs our simulations take into account to make parameter recommendations. \n\n|Symbol| 04-20 Volatility| 03-31 Volatility| Volatility Change| Weekly Average Daily Volume Change (%)  |\n| ------ | ---------------- | --------------- | ----------------- | ----------- |\n| SNX   | \t 1.157743939      |  1.229825464   | \t -0.072081525    |  -0.369436026    |\n| STETH    |  0.551022399     |   0.683796281    | \t-0.132773882    |  1.594020929 |\n| UNI    |   0.862907161    |  0.82903728     |  0.033869881   |  \t-0.702985756   |\n| USDC    |   0.033054958    |   0.029199586      |  0.003855372    |  \t0.062185316   |\n\n\n\n\n\n## Risk Dashboard\n\n\n\nThe community should use Gauntlet's [Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/aave) to understand better the updated parameter suggestions and general market risk in Aave V2. \n\nValue at Risk represents the 95th percentile **insolvency value** that occurs from simulations we run over a range of volatilities to approximate a tail event. \n\nLiquidations at Risk represents the 95th percentile **liquidation volume** that occurs from simulations we run over a range of volatilities to approximate a tail event.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/lk2ySHr.png)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Next Steps\n* Targeting an AIP on 2022-04-26",

        "body": "## Simple Summary\n\nA proposal to adjust nine (9) total risk parameters, including LTV, Liquidation Threshold, and Liquidation Bonus across five (5) Aave V2 assets. \n\n## Abstract\nThis proposal is a batch update of risk parameters to align with the [Moderate risk level](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/QmT9T4Rfnh1Z2HYmMPXvtFotMK2vSxiXK8dKStg2b6n4gi) chosen by the Aave community. These parameter updates are a continuation of Gauntlet's regular parameter recommendations.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\n\nThis set of parameter updates seeks to maintain the overall risk tolerance of the protocol while making risk trade-offs between specific assets.\n\nGauntlet's parameter recommendations are driven by an optimization function that balances 3 core metrics: insolvencies, liquidations, and borrow usage. Parameter recommendations seek to optimize for this objective function. Our agent-based simulations use a wide array of varied input data that changes on a daily basis (including but not limited to asset volatility, asset correlation, asset collateral usage, DEX / CEX liquidity, trading volume, expected market impact of trades, and liquidator behavior). Gauntlet's simulations tease out complex relationships between these inputs that cannot be simply expressed as heuristics. As such, the input metrics we show below can help understand why some of the param recs have been made but should not be taken as the only reason for recommendation. The individual collateral pages on the [Gauntlet Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/aave) cover other key statistics and outputs from our simulations that can help with understanding interesting inputs and results related to our simulations. \n\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/QFU5271.png)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/xl3fvhe.png)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/1QUP6m2.png)\n\nFor more details, please see [Gauntlet's Parameter Recommendation Methodology](https://medium.com/gauntlet-networks/gauntlets-parameter-recommendation-methodology-8591478a0c1c) and [Gauntlet's Model Methodology](https://medium.com/gauntlet-networks/gauntlets-model-methodology-ea150ff0bafd). \n\n\n**Top BAL non-recursive supplies and collateralization ratios:**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ZY6r2QJ.png)\n\n**Top DAI non-recursive supplies and collateralization ratios:**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/hZksKVb.png)\n\n**Top STETH non-recursive supplies and collateralization ratios:**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/BwEkhCQ.png)\n\n**Top SUSHI non-recursive supplies and collateralization ratios:**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/bIzuOhu.png)\n\n**Top YFI non-recursive supplies and collateralization ratios:**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/qUuOvtd.png)\n\n## Specification\n\nOur recent [market downturn report](https://governance.aave.com/t/market-risk-monthly-february-2022-updates-and-review/7476) showed that many collaterals are resilient to insolvencies, as our simulation models have predicted.

Note that, on our dashboard, the Value at Risk (VaR) metric for Aave Arc is currently $0. This low risk of insolvencies is reflective of the fact that the majority of borrowing on the platform is collateralized by the same asset as the assets being borrowed. As lending market usage grows, our platform will continue to ingest up-to-date data, re-run risk simulations, and make future parameter change recommendations.\n\n| Parameter | Current Value | Recommended Value |\n| -------- | -------- | -------- |\n| USDC Loan To Value     | 85.5%     | 87.5%     |\n| USDC Liquidation Threshold     | 88%     | 90%     |\n\n\n\n\n## Risk Dashboard\n\n\n\nThe community should use Gauntlet's [Aave V2 Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/aave) to understand better the updated parameter suggestions and general market risk in Aave V2. Gauntlet has also launched the [Aave Arc Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/aave_arc).\n\nValue at Risk represents the 95th percentile **insolvency value** that occurs from simulations we run over a range of volatilities to approximate a tail event. \n\nLiquidations at Risk represents the 95th percentile **liquidation volume** that occurs from simulations we run over a range of volatilities to approximate a tail event.\n\n### Aave V2 Dashboard\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Vdil33O.png)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Next Steps\n* Targeting an AIP on 2022-05-31\n\n*By approving this proposal, you agree that any services provided by Gauntlet shall be governed by the terms of service available at gauntlet.network/tos.*\n\n",

These parameter updates are a continuation of Gauntlet's regular parameter recommendations.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\n\nThis set of parameter updates seeks to maintain the overall risk tolerance of the protocol while making risk trade-offs between specific assets.\n\nGauntlet's parameter recommendations are driven by an optimization function that balances 3 core metrics: insolvencies, liquidations, and borrow usage. Parameter recommendations seek to optimize for this objective function. Our agent-based simulations use a wide array of varied input data that changes on a daily basis (including but not limited to, asset volatility, asset correlation, asset collateral usage, DEX / CEX liquidity, trading volume, expected market impact of trades, and liquidator behavior). Gauntlet's simulations tease out complex relationships between these inputs that cannot be simply expressed as heuristics. As such, the input metrics we show below can help understand why some of the param recs have been made, but should not be taken as the only reason for recommendation. The individual collateral pages on the [Gauntlet Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/aave) cover other key statistics and outputs from our simulations that can help with understanding interesting inputs and results related to our simulations. \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/lsnS8uc.png)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ZUtV48H.png)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/8z2buJD.png)\n\n\nFor more details, please see [Gauntlet's Parameter Recommendation Methodology](https://medium.com/gauntlet-networks/gauntlets-parameter-recommendation-methodology-8591478a0c1c) and [Gauntlet's Model Methodology](https://medium.com/gauntlet-networks/gauntlets-model-methodology-ea150ff0bafd). \n\n## Specification\n\nOur recent [market downturn report](https://governance.aave.com/t/market-risk-monthly-february-2022-updates-and-review/7476) showed that many collaterals are resilient to insolvencies, as our simulation models have predicted. We will continue to adjust risk parameters to drive increases in capital efficiency while maintaining protocol risk at safe levels. \n\n| Parameter | Current Value | Recommended Value |\n| -------- | -------- | -------- |\n| AAVE Loan To Value     | 60%     | 62.5%     |\n| DPI Liquidation Bonus     | 8.5%     | 7.5%     |\n| ENJ Liquidation Bonus    | 7.5%     | 6.5%     |\n| FEI Loan To Value    | 60%     | 65%     |\n| FEI Liquidation Threshold    | 70%     | 75%     |\n| MANA Loan To Value    | 65%     | 61.5%     |\n\n\nSee below volatility and exchange volume data from 02/24 to 03/17.

The below recommendations drive increases in capital efficiency while maintaining risk at safe levels.\n\n\n| Parameter | Current Value | Recommended Value |\n| -------- | -------- | -------- |\n| DPI Liquidation Bonus     | 8.5%     | 7.5%     |\n| FEI Loan To Value    | 60%     | 65%     |\n| FEI Liquidation Threshold    | 70%     | 75%     |\n\n\nSee below volatility and exchange volume data from 02/10 to 02/24. These are useful metrics to build intuition but are not the only inputs our simulations take into account to make parameter recommendations. \n\n|Symbol| 02-24 Volatility| 02-10 Volatility| Volatility Change| Weekly Average Daily Volume Change (%)  |\n| ------ | ---------------- | --------------- | ----------------- | ----------- |\n| DPI    | 0.767483446      | 0.952875317     | -0.185391871      | 4.8907976   |\n| FEI    | 0.05450812       | 0.072266895     | -0.017758775      | -41.5184138 |\n\n\n\n\n## Risk Dashboard\n\n\n\nThe community should use Gauntlet's [Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/aave) to better understand the updated parameter suggestions and general market risk in Aave V2. \n\nValue at Risk represents the 95th percentile **insolvency value** that occurs from simulations we run over a range of volatilities to approximate a tail event. \n\nLiquidations at Risk represents the 95th percentile **liquidation volume** that occurs from simulations we run over a range of volatilities to approximate a tail event.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/0UZoeQX.png)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Next Steps\n* Targeting an AIP on 2022-03-01\n",
