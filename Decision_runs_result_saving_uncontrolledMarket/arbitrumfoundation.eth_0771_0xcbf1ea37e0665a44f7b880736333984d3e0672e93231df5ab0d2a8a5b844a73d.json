        "body": "**Abstract**\n\nOn June 12th 2024, the DAO held an election for the role of STEP program manager to oversee ~$30 million diversified into liquid, stable and yield bearing RWAs. Steakhouse Financial won the vote with 60% in favor of their selection, with fees of $174,000 quoted in their application. \n\nThe Tally proposal in April 2024 listed 100k ARB as program management costs, which converted to $86,581 in June-July 2024 by the Arbitrum Foundation. This is insufficient to cover one year of Steakhouse Financials fees. Note: even if the ARB price had gone up, they would not have earned more - all applicant fees were quoted in dollar value and not ARB.\n\nThis proposal seeks input on the right way forward, with the options to\n- Approve only a 6 month contract from available funds\n- Earmark additional funds from yield earned so they complete the one year tenure\n- Not have a program manager, which will result in liquidation of the RWAs\n- Conduct a new RFP to select a program manager for one year at $86,581\n- Abstain\n\n**Motivation** \n\nOn April 10th 2024, the DAO approved 35 million ARB for diversification into RWAs. Of this, 100,000 ARB was budgeted for the role of program manager. The Arbitrum Foundation got an average price of 87 cents per ARB, resulting in $86,581 to pay the program manager.\n\n \n![2024-09-12 23.22.46.jpg](ipfs://bafkreicuaeyplf7wz2ayqzy33iailoxby5zohrg4gngmda4h5q3ja5otei)\n    \n\nIn June 2024, applications for the program manager role opened up where all applicants listed their fees in dollars. Given the funds received from the 100,000 ARB sale ($86,531) are less than the amount necessary to pay the $174,000 listed in Steakhouse Financials application, we need to either shorten their term to 6 months or approve an additional 6 months pay (from yield earned via the program). We can also declare the earlier election null and void while putting out a call for program managers willing to serve at $86,581 for a year. If there is no program manager to oversee investments, assets are liquidated and returned to the DAO.\n\n**Rationale** \n\nWhile writing the Tally proposal, 100k ARB was budgeted for the program manager role based on a sample quotation received from another provider and the prevailing ARB price at the time.\n\nSteakhouse financial and the other applicants prepared their budget in dollar value based on the sample provided instead of in ARB. As a result, the program manager role in the STEP program became under-budgeted and now needs approval from the DAO on provisioning either a shortened tenure of 6 months or additional funding to complete the one year. The additional funds will be requested from the yield earned on the RWAs (estimated at between $1-2 million per year) to prevent ARB liquidations. Alternatively, we can hold a new RFP seeking program managers at a fixed price of $86,581 for the year and invalidate the earlier election.\n\n**Specifications**\n\nThe STEP program is one of the largest diversification initiatives at any DAO, seeking to diversify our treasury while simultaneously growing the RWA ecosystem. Given the complications that can arise in managing the large sums of money, it is imperative that the DAO have a capable program manager to recommend liquidations ,conduct firedrills, monitor interest payments to the DAO treasury, and track underlying changes in service providers.\n\n**Steps to Implement**\n\nAfter ratification of Steakhouse Financials role as STEP program manager and whether it is 6 months or 1 year, the Arbitrum foundation will sign an agreement with Steakhouse Financial and begin investments into selected RWA providers.\n\n**Timeline**\n\n\nPost on forum\n\nUpload on Snapshot (Thursday, 12th September)\n\nFoundation negotiates agreement with Steakhouse and pays the first 6 months of their payment from the initial 100,000 ARB budgeted for in the STEP proposal\n\nAfter RWA yield is returned to the treasury, this proposal is taken to Tally requesting balance of $87,419 (provided one year tenure is approved in the snapshot)\n\n**Overall Cost**\n\nIf the entire one year tenure is ratified, the cost to the DAO is $87,419 paid via yield earned from the program. If 6 month tenure is approved, the cost is needing another election for program manager in a shortened time. If the proposal is rejected, we liquidate all $30 million and return assets to the DAO. If a new RFP is held seeking program manager services for $86,581 for a year, we delay the start of the STEP program and possibly get a less capable pool of applicants at the lower price point.\n\nThere is no budget required for work done on this proposal as it has been paid for through a Thrivecoin ThankArbitrum firestarter grant to the treasury and sustainability working group",

        "title": "[Non-Constitutional]: Arbitrum Stable Treasury Endowment Program",
        "author": "0x1B686eE8E31c5959D9F5BBd8122a58682788eeaD",
        "body": "TL;DR : This framework supports the budding RWA ecosystem on Arbitrum by diversifying 35 million ARB from our treasury (~1%) into stable & liquid bills or money market instruments earning a rate of return roughly equivalent to US Treasuries (hereby called ‘stable RWAs’)\n\nThis proposal is a trial run for a larger investment policy of the ArbitrumDAO treasury, both in: \n1. Creating a legal and infrastructural pipeline that future diversification proposals can take guidance from and\n2. Proof of concept that we can diversify our treasury in a way that supports ecosystem growth\n\nThis is NOT a grant; it is an investment that Arbitrum governance can exercise control over and recall, subject to agreed-upon conditions with a successful applicant.\n\n### Overview\n\nThe Stable Treasury Endowment Program (STEP) is the first proposal floated by the Treasury WG before the DAO. We are targeting stable RWAs backed by t-bills or money market instruments as the 1st step towards larger treasury diversification for several reasons;\n1. Once we figure out how to hold stable RWAs on our books, we can easily diversify based on best practices rather than procedural considerations. The stable coins we use today in De-Fi are mostly backed by t-bill RWAs; creating our own exposure can increase capital efficiency and mitigate risk.\n2. An insight from the Arbitrum Days workshop at Istanbul was the DAO needs a strategy/program for different verticals - RWAs, gaming, NFTs, De-Fi, DeSo, DeSci, etc. Another way of looking at STEP 1 is that it’s a proposal boosting the stable RWA vertical on Arbitrum, with the added advantage that it’s in the form of an investment rather than a grant.\n\n    More generally, stable RWAs have an attractive risk-reward ratio for Arbitrum in terms of sectors we should be nurturing. The total US treasury market is over $20 trillion, some of which is expected to come onchain to satisfy demand from wealthy investors. As the home of De-Fi, we should not cede space to [Base](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/12/12/coinbase-debuts-rwa-platform-built-on-base-under-abu-dhabi-regulators-oversight/) or [Mantle](https://snapshot.org/#/bitdao.eth/proposal/0x26884fce58b66e82fa74735a2e255f76654618278432897f4ca2430702e95dcd) that have their own RWA support program.\n\n3. Although protocols on Arbitrum and governance might wish to hold stable RWAs, they are limited by having to conduct due diligence on providers they can trust. This proposal creates a qualified screening committee that evaluates applicants and prepares a Assessment Report on them, providing a roster of vetted service providers that anyone can use for investing assets into RWAs\n\nIn conclusion, we expect that lessons learned from implementation of this proposal can pave the way for a new form of an ecosystem support program, where the ArbitrumDAO supports projects not with grants but purchases of financial products built on our chain that also diversify our treasury holdings.\n\n### Timeline and Procedure\n\n1. Snapshot temperature check and [if successful] an on-chain vote via Tally to fully implement this framework in February 2024;\n2. Screening committee publishes RFP with specific information requested from applicants and minimum criteria they must satisfy to be considered;\n3. Receive applications from service providers (30-day submission window);\n4. Screening committee reviews each application, and where needed, conduct additional due diligence and research;\n5. Assessment report on eligible service providers released by screening committee (April);\n6. ARB token holders divide their voting power among approved service providers to allocate sanctioned amount using the [Snapshot Weighted Voting](https://docs.snapshot.org/user-guides/proposals/voting-types) strategy. Providers receive an allocation proportionate to their support from ARB holders, provided they clear a threshold of 10% of all eligible votes.\n\n### Additional Considerations\n\n1. The Arbitrum foundation will act as the legal entity and face the service provider during the KYC process. They shall also hold any tokens/NFTs received in exchange of investments and have authority to withdraw assets from the service provider should any risks be discovered; however an explanation for the same shall be posted on the forum within 3 days of taking such an action. They will also periodically sweep interest earned from these assets to our treasury. Fire Drills will be periodically conducted to test solvency and clear out any AML delays in returning investments\n2. Interest earned from RWAs will be swept to our treasury for increasing our bridged USDC holdings (currently at 10 cents). For reference, $20 million in t-bills currently returns roughly $1 million in annual interest. Delay of more than 60 days in returning interest earned will result in liquidation of an investment from a service provider.\n3. Proposals to utilize interest earned will follow the same process as requesting funds from the treasury\n4. The screening committee will comprise of 6 members: Karpatkey, GFX Labs Steakhouse Financial, Nethermind and North Lake Legal, & the Treasury WG acting as facilitator and tie-breaking vote\n    * Karpatkey is a DeFi-native organisation specialising in professional DAO finance through industry-leading research and tooling since 2020. We’ve been working with GnosisDAO, Balancer, ENS, CoW Protocol, and Lido on financial planning, operations, and strategy, diversifying their treasuries into sustainable portfolios of DeFi investments designed to support DAOs in executing their missions.\n    * GFX Labs is the leading provider of professional governance services in DeFi. We are most known for our extensive past and present contributions at Uniswap, MakerDAO, Compound, and Optimism. GFX focuses on operational improvements and improving organizational quality and structure, with strong relevant experience in real-world asset onboarding and stablecoins.\n    * Steakhouse Financial is the leading CFO-as-a-service consulting company for DAOs. We specialize in stablecoins and RWAs. Our team has been merging TradFi and DeFi for years – our team met as contributors to the Strategic Finance Core Unit at MakerDAO.\n\n        We’ve contributed extensively to asset-liability management research and structuring MakerDAOs RWA portfolio, including its exposure to treasuries. We specialize in deep due-diligence reports of tokenized issuers and publish the leading research report and Dune dashboards covering the space https://dune.com/steakhouse/tokenized-securities\n\n    * *Nethermind* is a blockchain research and software engineering company empowering enterprises and developers worldwide to work with and build upon decentralized systems. Our work touches every part of the Web3 ecosystem, from fundamental cryptography research to security, node infrastructure, DeFi, and application-layer protocol development. We have a team of over 220, with more than 180 engineers on board. Nethermind is a key contributor to the development of Ethereum, with our execution client representing over a quarter of all synced nodes. Additionally, we actively build the Starknet ecosystem and support our institutional and enterprise partners in advanced blockchain, digital assets, and decentralized finance (DeFi) fields.\n    * North Lakes Legal is a law firm at the leading edge of bridging decentralized finance, DAOs and Real World Assets. North Lakes Legal implemented the standards for the initial high-profile real- world asset (“RWA”) financings in the DeFi space. Christian Petersen is the principal of North Lakes Legal and has 26 years of cross border project and structured finance experience. In support of Maker DAO, North Lakes Legal has structured, negotiated, and implemented the following:\n        -  Société Generale – DAI 40 million, tokenized French covered bonds\n        - Huntingdon Valley Bank – DAI 100 million vault to acquire RWA loan participations\n        - BlockTower Credit – DAI 150 million vault utilizing Tinlake for various RWAs\n        - Monetalis Clydesdale – DAI 500 million to acquire U.S. treasury ETF\n        - Most recently, North Lakes Legal advised Ondo Finance in the development, structuring and launch of Ondo USDY.\n\n5. The Assessment Report prepared by the screening committee on eligible service providers will be used to inform delegates and ARB holders in casting their weighted snapshot vote dividing sanctioned ARB among providers. Details in the Assessment Report include schedule for returning interest, relationship with Arbitrum (debtor or custodian), maturation period of asset, legal structure (bankruptcy remote assessment), solvency, Arbitrum alignment, turnaround time for returning investment, transparency level (proof of reserves/read only access to accounts), and fees charged.\n6. 200,000 ARB for implementation of this proposal; unused funds returned to treasury\n\nAnticipated expenditures include\n* 6 month third party audit on selected providers\n* Honorarium of 500 ARB per application for each of the 6 screening committee members (NB: this * may * be supplemented with a small application fee not exceeding $1000 to prevent spam proposals;\n* Engaging external experts and due diligence specialists where relevant.\n* Full account of fund utilization will be posted on the forum. \n\n7. Eligibility: Full RFP will be created by screening committee post Snapshot approval. Some preliminary considerations;\n* Tokenized tbills launched or bridged to Arbitrum are NOT a hard requirement to apply.\n* Attested for verifiability of assets by a 3rd party\n* Strong reputation with relevant team experience, evidence of managing assets, and regulatory compliance\n* Fully liquid, secured, and safe investments that can be called back by the DAO with 3 working days notice\n* Between 0.15-0.4% (15-40 bps) of total amount in fees with no bonuses, \n* Liquid t-bills or money market instruments approximating the so called “risk-free rate of return”",

        "author": "0x2e3BEf6830Ae84bb4225D318F9f61B6b88C147bF",
        "body": "**Non-Constitutional Proposal**\n\n**AUTHORS**\n[Iron Boots](https://twitter.com/SirBootsOfIron) (BD Lead), [Myrddin](https://twitter.com/0xmyrddin) (Dev Lead)\n\n...\n\n## Abstract\n\nThis post proposes granting 1.5M ARB per month to Camelot DAO for the next 6 months to fund liquidity incentives for Arbitrum-focused projects on Camelot, including the onboarding of new and multi-chain protocols entering the ecosystem. Camelot strives to support the native ecosystem through collaborative relationships and has a proven track record of allocating incentives to enable sustainable growth and long-term liquidity for ecosystem protocols. This proposal will therefore support deeper spot liquidity for Arbitrum native builders, as well as supporting integration partners and the launch of new protocols, thereby enabling significant growth through an approach that prioritizes Arbitrum’s core values. Most importantly, this will further the adoption of ARB as a base asset within liquidity pools and partner integrations.\n\n...\n\n## Motivation\n\nCamelot is not just a DEX - it’s the infrastructure that enables native protocols to build sustainable and efficient liquidity. As Arbitrum’s first major native DEX, Camelot strives to support the ecosystem with a long-term and collaborative approach that moves beyond the traditional role of DEXs as simple ‘yield farms’.\n\nIn just over 6 months of being live, Camelot has achieved over $2,500,000,000 total volume traded, highs of $100m TVL, and the successful onboarding of countless protocols to the Arbitrum ecosystem. The Round Table is the hub for Camelot’s official long-term partners, and the initial members consisted of the core Arbitrum protocols such as Vela, Jones, Pendle, Plutus, GMX, Sperax, and more. On average, Round Table partners have over 90% of their total DEX liquidity and volume on Camelot.\n\nSince then, the Round Table now consists of over 25 official partner protocols, and through its launchpad Camelot has supported over 9 protocols to raise funds in a community-focused and decentralized way. Most importantly, Camelot is home to numerous community builders that leverage the custom-built features to manage their liquidity, with a combined reach of over 40 native protocols present on Camelot and over 15 integrations being built on top of its infrastructure. Camelot is one of the most used dapps in the ecosystem, with over 300,000 unique users since launch. Camelot is not a fork, and is custom-built code that has been thoroughly tested and audited by Paladin. In addition, Camelot has no private investors and was launched in a truly community-focused and decentralized way. The ownership of Camelot has been spread through the key Arbitrum players, thereby making the protocol truly part of the ecosystem and community.\n\nThis grant would have a significant impact on the growth of the Arbitrum ecosystem in several ways:\n\n* Deep spot liquidity is the foundation for DeFi protocols to thrive, enabling further innovation and use cases for Arbitrum native protocols. For example, deeper spot liquidity unlocks the potential for tokens to be used in lending markets, options and perps protocols, structured products, and much more. Whilst other DEXs also tackle this for blue chip tokens, Camelot is uniquely positioned to most effectively support the native ecosystem builders. This proposal will specifically focus on Arbitrum protocols throughout their lifecycle, whilst leveraging the network and community of Camelot to generate sustainable growth with real users. Deepening pools that already have significant liquidity is not our only focus, as Camelot is positioned to ensure the distribution of ARB tokens materializes into a stronger ecosystem. Most importantly, Camelot can work with partners to pair their tokens with ARB as a base asset. This will advance ARB as a foundational asset of the ecosystem, providing it with direct value and utility.\n\n* Camelot has a proven track record of effectively allocating rewards in a sustainable and economical way. Therefore, not only will this grant proposal deepen liquidity, it will also ensure that the most active and aligned builders on Arbitrum directly benefit from it too. As an ecosystem hub for native builders, Camelot will leverage this grant to support and incentivise new protocols launching in the ecosystem, further cementing Arbitrum’s position as the go-to layer 2 for innovation and DeFi. Through its launchpad and network of Round Table partners, Camelot additionally offers protocols marketing, BD, and general support.\n\n* In addition to liquidity, Camelot is one of the largest Arbitrum governance delegates and has continued to foster collaboration in the ecosystem. Therefore, this proposal would also focus on integration partners that enable more efficient liquidity management and further use cases. These protocols also build on top of our partner liquidity pools, therefore multiplying the network effects of the allocated Arb incentives. Camelot currently has over 15 integration partners, ranging from advanced liquidity management apps, leveraged yield farming, derivatives, structured products, and more.\n\n...\n\n## Rationale\n\nCamelot was conceived to help deliver Arbitrum’s goal of scaling and revolutionizing the future of Ethereum. Through its commitment to supporting native builders, Camelot strives to build the foundation of sustainable liquidity and collaboration that will allow Arbitrum and its diverse ecosystem to thrive.\n\nSince its inception in December 2022, Camelot has maintained a robust upward trajectory, steered by a long-term, sustainable incentives approach. We've avoided the common pitfalls of being a ‘yield-farm for mercenary capital,’ and our proven track record of allocating incentives effectively to yield maximum returns for our community, protocol, and ecosystem stands testament to our potential. We plan to harness the power of Arbitrum grant incentives to maintain this growth trajectory.\n\nThough past performance doesn't necessarily predict future success, it does offer valuable insights into the potential of this proposal. Over the period from December 2022 to May 2023, Camelot experienced an impressive average monthly increase in volume and Total Value Locked (TVL) of 275% and 79% respectively. Even more noteworthy is that during this period, Camelot generated over $10m in protocol fees, with a significant proportion of these channelled back to our token holders. This strongly suggests that, with the additional Arbitrum incentives, we can stimulate significant growth and capture substantial long-term value across a large number of native protocols. Moreover, we can achieve this while ensuring a decentralized and sustainable token ownership distribution. Camelot also received an airdrop of over 2,000,000 ARB, which has so far been fully dedicated to being an active governance participant.\n\nTo allocate the Arbitrum incentives even more effectively we will distribute it across 4 different categories: Ecosystem Builders, Integration Partners, Core Pairs, and Liquid Staking Derivatives.\n\n![image](ipfs://bafkreicjatrrpsk2u22lkmiqwklpmnk5jqkacc45odyf7npqib3hrgydse)    \n\n### Ecosystem Builders\n\nCamelot is home to many of Arbitrum’s favourite protocols, and this category will distribute incentives to builders that are fully aligned with Camelot’s approach to sustainable liquidity and long-term collaboration. As detailed in the ‘Specifications’ section below, Camelot is one of the most effective hubs to distribute incentives, due to the large and expansive network of long-term partners.\n\n### Integration Partners\n\nBy providing incentives to partners that are building on top of Camelot’s infrastructure, we are diversifying the use of incentives to fuel even further innovation and growth that benefits all partners and the broader ecosystem, whilst also deepening the underlying liquidity at the same time. These partners would include concentrated liquidity managers, leveraged yield protocols, lending markets, liquidity management dapps and more.\n\n### Core pairs\n\nWhilst Camelot’s primary focus is on the native Arbitrum builders, ensuring Camelot can offer deep liquidity for the most actively traded tokens like ETH and USDC is also important as the native DEX. With the number of protocols actively building on Camelot, deep liquidity for core pairs will be an important piece to ensure we have a strong foundation that can expand to longer-tail tokens too.\n\n### Liquid staked derivatives\n\nLiquid staked derivatives are seeing rapid growth as they unlock significant liquidity on Ethereum whilst securing the network at the same time. The majority of LSD liquidity is currently on Ethereum, and we think it’s an important catalyst for the broader Arbitrum ecosystem to support LSD adoption natively too. Deeper LSD liquidity will allow Arbitrum native builders to tap into a highly productive asset to build on top of, leading to further growth, utility, and products for the ecosystem.\n\n### Velodrome on Optimism as Precedent\n\nWhile Arbitrum is a unique ecosystem which is difficult to compare to other networks, the effect of Optimism’s grant to Velodrome in July of 2022 supports that a similar grant to Camelot could have a positive effect on the Arbitrum ecosystem. Velodrome received a 3M OP grant from the Optimism Foundation in July of 2022 that was meant to last 4-5 months. As seen in the visual below, Velodrome had around $14M in TVL, generated around $3.3k in weekly fees, and had $2M in daily volume before the grant. In the last 3 months, Camelot has averaged over $80M in TVL, $450,000 in weekly fees, and $18M in daily volume. While TVL and volume numbers can be skewed by low fee-generating mercenary TVL, fees paid are less biased, and Camelot has been earning over 100x more fees than Velodrome before incentives.\n\n![image](ipfs://bafkreidwm2wtosajdmpiqyryhwv3wvbrr634fp2zavgebk5z7jjl6igwdu)    \n\nCamelot has surpassed Velodrome by nearly every metric by using novel, long-term emission incentives. Thus, we’re asking for 1.5M ARB per month vs Velodrome’s 3M OP over 4-5 months. Because Camelot is currently in a much better position than pre-grant Velodrome, we expect that the ARB grant will increase liquidity depth on Camelot and the general ecosystem expansion even more, supercharging the network to a new level.\n\nTo provide additional perspective, the Arbitrum DAO treasury currently holds 3,527,046,084 ARB tokens. Assuming a hypothetical 10-year runway of treasury spending, this would be equivalent to 352m ARB tokens a year. Camelot’s grant proposal for a total of 9m ARB tokens would therefore represent 2.56% of the annual budget, with the expectation of significant ecosystem growth and expansion.\n\n***Camelot TVL, Volume and Fees before ARB Grant***\n![image](ipfs://bafkreiflwh7et2aybm4bhk2aunxtlloz6h3yxtxdd4gffgawyhajcno4l4)\n\n...\n\n## Specifications\n\nCamelot will distribute 1,500,000 ARB tokens per month as incentives across a broad range of Arbitrum liquidity pools and integrations. The distribution of these incentives will adhere to the Proposal Objectives, the proposal parameters, and the Transparency Report. \n\nThe transparency report will ensure that Camelot has clearly documented where every $ARB token has been allocated, the relevant growth metrics achieved, and most importantly the progress for its broader Arbitrum objectives. You can see the objectives and parameters below and a template of the transparency report attached. This report will be provided at the latest 72 hrs before the following month’s incentives are to be distributed.\n\n### Proposal Objectives\n*(As measured and tracked within the transparency report, attached below)*\n\n* To grow the liquidity of Arbitrum builders, bringing new users into the ecosystem and directly supporting the growth of ecosystem protocols\n* To use the incentives to bring new protocols into the Arbitrum ecosystem\n* To support the launch of native builders and their liquidity requirements\n* To advance the adoption of ARB as a base asset in liquidity pools\n* To advance the adoption of ARB within integration partner strategies\n* To provide marketing and community support to the ecosystem builders included in the incentive programme\n\n### Proposal Parameters\n*(As measured and tracked within the transparency report, attached below)*\n\n* Incentives will be distributed to a minimum of 30 partner pools, as documented in the transparency report. Any new pool or integration needs to be clearly documented beforehand in the transparency report.\n* No single pool or partner (excluding core $ARB pools) can receive more than 5% of the total incentives (as measured over a 30-day period)\n* No single pool or integration partner can receive more than 5% of its TVL in monthly incentives (as measured over a 30-day period)\n* A pool must maintain a minimum trading volume of $1,000,000 annualized to be valid to receive rewards (as measured over a 30-day period).\n* A minimum of 33% of the total incentives will be used on liquidity pools with $ARB as the base asset. On top of this minimum, Camelot will provide bonus incentives to teams that actively transition their liquidity to ARB as a base asset too. This will be included and measured within the aforementioned transparency report.\n* The partner integration section has now been merged into the “Ecosystem Builders” section, with the relevant parameters above being applicable.\n* If at any point the Arbitrum community or DAO is not satisfied with the performance or delivery, they can move forward with a governance vote to end the grant early.\n\nCamelot will distribute the incentives across the following categories and pools detailed below. The distribution across these various pools will adhere to the Proposal Objectives and parameters, please reference the transparency report for a more in-depth breakdown:\n\n[TRANSPARENCY REPORT](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_os6yN7G2kdoeoXNotX0nqsYXQyJ0bakGXavmLNIXdc/edit?usp=sharing)\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreifbxdwctnf335rkwqpw7k5dejulbgc3wbcmjxew45pkxxttyamhrq)\n\n* Ecosystem Builders 75%\n  * Liquidity incentives for partner pools such as Vela, Pendle, Plutus, Jones and a diverse range of Arbitrum protocols. This will include integration partners that build on top of Camelot liquidity pools, such as Gamma and DeFi Edge, following the same parameters and guidelines shared above.\n  * The transparency report contains a broader breakdown of the ecosystem pools that this will be focused on. In addition, these incentives will be used to encourage the adoption of ARB as a base asset for ecosystem protocol liquidity pools.\n\n* Core Pairs 15%\n  * These represent the core liquidity pools such as ARB/ETH, ETH/USDC, and USDC/USDC. Further examples are included in the transparency report.\n\n* Liquid Staking Derivatives 10%\n  * Focusing on a diverse range of LSDs, most of which have little liquidity on Arbitrum. This will therefore target protocols such as unshETH, Lido, Rocket Pool, Swell, Stafi and more.\n\nCamelot will utilize its Nitro Pools technology to release the granted ARB in combination with $GRAIL and $xGRAIL emissions to liquidity providers. Nitro Pools are custom-built permissionless solutions to distribute incentives to any liquidity pool, with the ability to add custom requirements also. Along with the rest of the protocol, Nitro Pools have been audited by Paladin, and used by Camelot and numerous partners over the previous 8 months.\n\n\n...\n\n## Steps to implement\n\nCamelot will receive 1,5000,000 monthly over a period of 6 months, for a total of 9m ARB. In order to most transparently receive the tokens requested, Camelot will use a new multisig that will have several ecosystem players from other Arbitrum protocols. The makeup of this multisig, including the protocol affiliation(s) of each signer will be made public upon the creation of the multisig (before the proposal is moved to snapshot), and all changes to the makeup of the multisig will be announced in advance. This multisig will be governed by a multisig participation agreement wherein each signer will agree to use their signing authority only to further the interest of the wallet itself, using the ARB tokens to incentivise liquidity in approved nitro pools. By structuring the multi-sig with signers representative of the broader Arbitrum ecosystem, Camelot will ensure that the ARB tokens granted by the Arbitrum DAO will be leveraged to support new protocols, DAOs, and projects that are broadly value additive for Arbitrum.\n\nCamelot currently has [2,189,094 ARB tokens](https://debank.com/profile/0x03ff2d78afb69e0859ec6beb4cf107d3741e97ab) in its treasury, which it has used entirely for governance purposes. As an additional safeguard and sign of assurance, Camelot commits to placing its own ARB into the grant multisig for the duration of the 6 month proposal, therefore at any given time, Camelot will have “guaranteed” more ARB than it would receive from the Arbitrum DAO. Once the grant is over, Camelot will receive its own 2,189,094 ARB tokens back.\n\nOnce the ARB tokens have been distributed to the intended multisig wallet, Camelot will bear the full responsibility and workload to ensure the effective allocation of these tokens. Camelot will actively manage and continuously analyze the effectiveness of the incentives being used, following the aforementioned proposal objectives and parameters, and clearly documenting any changes or adjustments in the transparency report.\n\nMore information on the mechanics of Camelot’s nitro pools is available [here](https://docs.camelot.exchange/protocol/nitro-pools). Once the ARB tokens have been distributed to the grant multisig, Camelot will then further distribute them to internal wallets where the tokens will be used as incentives for the pools and partner integrations mentioned above under ‘Specifications’.\n\n* Camelot will receive 1,500,000 ARB tokens per month for 6 months, which it will distribute in accordance to the proposal objectives and parameters.\n* Camelot will detail how every ARB token is allocated and the progress towards the proposal objectives within the [transparency report](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_os6yN7G2kdoeoXNotX0nqsYXQyJ0bakGXavmLNIXdc/edit?usp=sharing).\n* The transparency report will be shared no later than 72 hours before the next month's incentives are distributed.\n* Camelot will hold a bi-weekly public community call to discuss the performance and progress of the grant and the transparency report in further detail.\n\n...\n\n## Timeline\n\nCamelot will begin the grant distribution from the date this proposal is passed and the ARB is delivered until 6 months after. The 1.5M ARB will be distributed monthly to the relevant ecosystem multisig mentioned above, for a total of 6 months.\n\nOnce the grant is active, Camelot will provide the subsequent transparency reports no later than 72 hours before the next month's incentives are to be distributed. The transparency report will follow the template that is attached and will include all relevant information. Following the conclusion of the grant, Camelot will provide a comprehensive analysis of the performance of the grant and its impact.\n\n...\n\n## Overall cost\n\n1,500,000 ARB distributed monthly over 6 months, for a total of 9M ARB tokens.",

        "body": "Please find the full proposal on the forums, several sections have been removed to adhere to character limits: https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rfc-fund-the-stylus-sprint/26437?u=entropy\n\n## Abstract\n\nThe [ArbOS 31 “Bianca”](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/108288822474129076868455956066667369439381709547570289793612729242368710728616) onchain vote on Tally has passed quorum, signaling the DAO’s approval to activate Arbitrum Stylus on Arbitrum One and Nova. To bolster the impact of this upgrade, this proposal presents the one-time \"Stylus Sprint\" program, aimed at encouraging the early development of Stylus smart contracts and tooling by awarding up to 5,000,000 ARB to teams who build with Stylus. Applications will be open for 8 weeks and the program will run for 1 year. The Sprint will include a mix of open applications where teams are encouraged to be creative in their ideas as well as invitational/RFQs with strategically targeted objectives. The requested funding is intended to cover development costs, including hiring talent, training teams, adopting new tools, infrastructure expenses, and audits at the discretion of the recipient. This campaign's primary objectives are to engage new and existing Arbitrum protocol teams with this novel technology, showcase use cases only feasible with Stylus, and create foundational Stylus building blocks for widespread use.\n\nInterested teams must apply through a designated application process and grant recipients will be selected by an Evaluation Committee based on specific criteria detailed in this proposal. As the program progresses, participating teams will receive staged funding as they reach predefined and agreed-upon milestones, culminating in the deployment and long-term upkeep of their projects.\n\n## Specifications\n\n### Application Process & RFP Details:\n\nAs mentioned, the Stylus Sprint program invites teams to submit applications either in the open-applications track or in response to lightweight Request for Proposals (RFPs, listed below) that target specific verticals, published by the Evaluation Committee. The below lists are non-exhaustive and serve as inspiration. Participants in the open track will have ample opportunity for innovation and creativity. All requests for both the open-application track and RFPs must be denominated in ARB.\n\nThe application approach described above for both open applications and RFPs ensures a structured yet flexible framework for harnessing the potential of Stylus technology. Not all funds will necessarily be deployed, and even if an RFP has quotes, there is no guarantee that any will be deemed satisfactory and chosen. The above categories are non-exhaustive and meant to be viewed as examples. If this proposal passes, the Evaluation Committee will cement an official list before applications open.\n\nTeams are required to submit a detailed application outlining their plans for utilizing the funding. These applications will be thoroughly reviewed by the Evaluation Committee, which will also approve them. Upon approval, milestone payments will be systematically allocated to the teams based on their progress. If no satisfactory applications are received, as decided at the discretion of the Evaluation Committee, 0 ARB will be spent, and all unspent funds will be returned to DAO.\n\n### Evaluation Committee and Committee Advisors\n\nTo effectively administer the program, it is essential to establish an Evaluation Committee composed of Stylus experts. Additionally, a group of advisors will provide consultative support to the committee. Given the innovative nature and specific technical nuances of Stylus, we propose that the committee be primarily made up of members from Offchain Labs and OpenZeppelin, the two entities responsible for developing Stylus thus far. Currently, there are limited experts qualified to assess Stylus applications effectively. However, should the DAO prefer to engage in a broader selection process that we believe would be inefficient and lead to a less successful program, Entropy Advisors is more than happy to facilitate an RFP process instead, contingent upon a DAO vote to define and appoint these roles.\n\nEvaluation Committee\n\n1. Stylus Team Members - Offchain Labs (Waiving Payment)\n2. Dev Team - Arbitrum Foundation (Waiving Payment)\n3. Entropy Advisors (Waiving Payment)\n4. Michael Lewellen - OpenZeppelin (5000 ARB per month)\n5. Gustavo Gonzalez - OpenZeppelin (5000 ARB per month)\n\nCommittee Advisors\n\n1. Entropy Advisors (Waiving Payment)\n\nThe Committee Advisors’ main role will be facilitating discourse with the DAO, applicants, and general project management in order to reduce the burden on the Evaluation Committee where possible. **Members of the Evaluation Committee and Committee Advisors will not be eligible to apply to the program in any capacity due to conflicts of interest.**\n\nJudges and Advisors will serve for approximately 14.5 months. In the first 2 weeks, they will work together to refine the application and evaluation criteria as well as specifics around the RFPs to kickstart the process. The following 2 months will be used to review proposals as they come in. Subsequent 2 weeks will be taken to officially accept and reject projects. **Both accepted and rejected applications will receive public rationale from the Evaluation Committee as to why the choice was made so that the DAO may have a view into the decisions and the teams can adjust accordingly in the future.** In the next 12 months, contributors will greenlight milestone payments as projects achieve their goals and periodically give guidance to participants. Advisors will report back to the DAO through monthly updates over the lifespan of the program.\n\n### Multisig Setup\n\nThe Stylus Sprint multi-sig will be created and allocated 5M ARB for the Stylus Sprint Program and 150K ARB for payments to judges. Funds will be sent to an MSS-secured multisig. The funds in the multisig belong to the DAO and the signers act as grant managers on behalf of the DAO in coordination with the Arbitrum Foundation. Funds held in the multisig are explicitly banned from usage in DAO governance, including delegation.\n\n### Funding Levels and Disbursement\n\nTeams will apply for their appropriate levels of funding. Suggested levels in ARB are 1M, 750K, 500K, 250K, 100K, or 50K. If teams want a different amount of funding, they must specify why in their application. These funding levels have been set to streamline the review process. However, teams are encouraged to request specific amounts of funding best suited to their needs. Teams will have 1 year to deploy their project and meet their 2 post-deployment milestones.\n\nUnallocated funds will be returned to the DAO treasury after all applications have been reviewed and grant sizes have been determined. An additional dispersal to the DAO could occur if projects don’t manage to hit their goals within the 1-year timeline and if the budget has remaining ARB. There is absolutely no need to allocate all funds, and it will only be done if more than 5M in exemplary proposals are received during the 8-week application cycle.\n\nFunding will be distributed based on achieving certain development milestones. 50% of funds will be distributed after deployment to encourage teams to think about growth and sustainability post-launch. The criteria for these 2 checkpoints will be proposed by teams in their applications.\n\nAll projects will be required to use milestones in order to ensure progress is being made before funds are fully allocated. The above milestone structure, however, is not required. For RFPs, custom milestone payments can be included in the quotes provided by service providers. Approved projects will submit requests as they reach milestones. The judges, with help from their advisors, will be responsible for ensuring validity and greenlighting payment to be sent as milestones are hit, in accordance with the Evaluation Criteria mentioned above. The evaluation committee will have the autonomy and authority to expel projects from the program at any point in their life cycle and stop all future milestone payments.\n\n## Timeline\n\n1. Stylus Sprint Forum Post - August 20, 2024\n2. Snapshot Vote Begins - August 29, 2024\n3. On-Chain Vote - Sept 12, 2024\n6. Stylus Sprint Begins - Oct 4, 2024\n\nThe program will begin on the Monday following the onchain proposal’s passing. The first 2 weeks will be used to refine and post the RFPs, followed by open applications for 8 weeks, then a 2-week application review process. Feedback between the Evaluation Committee and applicants will be conducted on an ongoing/continuous basis over the next 10 weeks. KYC with the foundation will then begin and first milestone payments may be allocated upon completion. The MSS chairs, Arbitrum Foundation, and Entropy Advisors will need to work closely to ensure a strict payment process.\n\n## Overall Cost\n\n**5,180,000 ARB**\n\nUp to 5M to be awarded to projects building on Stylus\n\n75,000 ARB payment in total over 14.5 months per committee member for 2 committee members = 150,000 ARB\n\n30,000 ARB paid up front to Questbook.",

        "body": "# Abstract\nThis proposal requests 250 million ARB to enable The Arbitrum Foundation (a.k.a ‘The Foundation’) to further foster key strategic partnerships. All expenditures will follow The Foundation’s well-established practices and evaluation criteria when pursuing partnership deals. Should the proposal be approved by the ArbitrumDAO, the Foundation will update its next annual transparency report due in Q1 2025 to include and detail this additional budget.\n\n# Motivation\nIn line with its mission as seen in its [bylaws](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/assets/files/The%20Arbitrum%20Foundation%20Bylaws%2020%20July%202023-d992cde49b3207e89bdec76322e29048.pdf), The Foundation is committed to fostering ecosystem growth through strategic partnerships. All agreements are designed to support projects that can grow the Arbitrum ecosystem and provide value to the ArbitrumDAO. By seeking projects that advance or contribute to the adoption of Arbitrum technology, the Foundation aims to grow activity on the Arbitrum networks.\n\nAgreements typically last for a few years in order to align a project’s interests with the long-term objectives of the Arbitrum ecosystem. This results in significant capital locked in commitments and reserved for projects based on the agreed performance milestones. This restricts the Foundation’s ability to pursue new partnerships and stay ahead of the competition. Given the aggregate size of Foundation’s current budget, it is difficult for us to pursue multiple large deals simultaneously.\n\n# Challenges\nThe Foundation runs two funding programs:\n\n* Arbitrum Foundation Grant Program\n* Strategic Partnership’s Program\n\nBoth programs invite applicants from the ecosystem while actively pursuing new opportunities by participating in competitive bids to prospective partners. In both cases, The Foundation signs milestone-based agreements with the recipient that are often multi-year contractual commitments. To date, agreements for our strategic partnerships program typically exceed 2M ARB with an average duration of 2.1 years.\n\n*Table: Capital Commitments to Grants, Strategic Partnerships and Infrastructure Service Providers*\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreibub2zxpre2wwuuetnzxqnwuea4yrjtfknh5mb6p3jebvvk7sd76q)\n\n*1) Includes payments made in ARB converted to USD using the ARB spot price at the time of payment*\n*2) Includes both [confidential and non-confidential grants](https://arbitrumfoundation.notion.site/d8de51f4a1b84b18ab33b2c9d14c69ae?v=4b8df83cbb7e4da9ad1e9b0e9354389a)*\n*3) Includes items that fall outside the scope of the rows above*\n\nThis table provides an overview of The Foundation’s outstanding capital commitments since its inception, as of June 30th 2024. Based on the stage of commitment, we can classify all existing deals into two categories:\n\n* **Signed agreements.** The Foundation and the grant recipient or service provider have entered into an agreement. Most grant recipients will be entitled to grant payouts as milestones and/or other criteria are reached. The amounts in the table reflect the value of future financial obligations related to signed agreements.\n\n* **Pre-agreement offer.** An agreement has not yet been reached but is in negotiation. The Foundation has reserved funds to ensure we can act upon the commitment when an agreement is reached. The amounts in the table reflect the full value of the agreement.\n\nIn both cases, The Foundation must have adequate reserves available before it can make an offer to a potential partner. Given the competitive landscape, The Foundation must be able to make multiple offers to different partners simultaneously, and be prepared for all offers to be accepted and reserve amounts accordingly even if negotiations fail at a later stage.\n\nWith the above in mind, The Foundation is at a distinct disadvantage from extending competitive offers to strategic partners due to the size of our overall allocation from the DAO. The three major financial challenges currently facing The Foundation from extending continued support to ecosystem expansion are:\n\n* **Tight budget.** Relative to competitors, the budget that the Foundation can allocate for strategic partnerships is small and puts the Arbitrum ecosystem at a significant disadvantage. For example, if we consider allocations relative to token supply, Starknet has allocated ~20% to its Foundation and grants, Optimism has 25% for ecosystem funding, ZkSync has 19.9% for ecosystem initiatives, while The Arbitrum Foundation has 7.5% allocated, but to date, The Arbitrum Foundation has only had access to approximately 1.8% because of the vesting contract. \n\n* **Vesting.** The Foundation can only make offers based on the ARB that has vested to date. This is because the ArbitrumDAO can clawback the funds at any time and we must have the ARB available to pay milestones. The Foundation is committed to being solvent at all times, so our assets should always exceed our contractual liabilities.\n\n* **Capital lockup.** All committed ARB in a milestone-based agreement must be allocated until the agreement terminates. Additionally, some agreements require capital lockup (like RWAs), in projects where the funds belong to the Foundation, but they are utilized by the strategic partner’s protocol.\n\nTogether, The Foundation does not yet have access to its full budget which has caused issues over the past year, but even if the vesting was complete, our budget still remains the smallest amongst all rollups. This impacts all programs run by The Foundation including strategic partnerships, technical advancement, educational and community activities.\n\nWe believe the most straightforward approach to ensuring The Arbitrum Foundation can pursue competitive deals is by increasing our budget for strategic partnerships.\n\n# Proposed Solution\n\n**Funding Request: 250 million ARB**\n\nIn light of the aforementioned challenges, here are the reasons why we believe that increasing our budget to specifically better support strategic partnerships is essential:\n\n* **High costs of pursuing partnerships.** Strategic partnerships are essential for the Arbitrum ecosystem’s growth, and these partnerships often come with significant capital investments from The Foundation. For example, onboarding RWAs is both challenging and capital-intensive, as experienced by the DAO as well.\n\n* **Expanding Orbit Chains.** Despite more than 50 chains publicly announcing their intent to build using Orbit since the launch of the Arbitrum Expansion Program in January 2024, the rollup as a tech stack ecosystem is still in its early stages. Additional funding is required to enable The Foundation to pursue major Orbit partnerships and allow the Arbitrum ecosystem to access new markets, use cases and communities.\n\n* **Gateway to DAO.** The DAO has previously contributed to onboarding partners via programs like STEP, however, the experience has been that most institutions are not inclined toward engaging and participating in public forums, and even when they do it is after extensive conversations with The Foundation and its service providers, who are making them aware of the opportunities and encouraging them to get involved. As front-line enablers, The Foundation actively builds relationships with partners and encourages all partners to engage with the DAO. Most recent examples include Securitize (via BlackRock BUIDL) and Franklin Templeton.\n\n* **Proven track record.** The Foundation has a proven track record of managing and allocating funds effectively for various initiatives, as evidenced by the [2024 Biannual Progress Report](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/assets/files/ArbitrumFoundationBiannualReport2024H1-c8e9ab997fe68ad09c0105181f9826d8.pdf) and successful collaborations with industry-leading projects. Additionally, The Foundation has capitalized on emerging opportunities such as LRTs, RWAs and onchain gaming, ensuring the Arbitrum ecosystem remains competitive and innovative.\n\nWe also believe the current vesting schedule for our entire budget is still critical to remain as is for setting expectations for The Foundation and holding us accountable for how we execute our mission statements. This sets a good example that all programs approved by the DAO must remain accountable and should not assume they can receive all their funding immediately.\n\nWith the above in mind, we are requesting 250 million ARB from the ArbitrumDAO, to focus on agreements fulfilling the following 3 criteria:\n\n* Key opportunities exceeding 2 million ARB\n* New agreements signed after approval of this proposal\n* Contractual commitments lasting 1 year or longer\n\nSome foreseeable capital-intensive areas include but are not limited to, expanding the Orbit Chain ecosystem, securing new RWA opportunities, and onboarding well-known TradeFi institutions on Arbitrum. Tokens will only be allocated on an as-needed basis and will only be exchanged as contractual obligations need to be fulfilled.\n\nThe Foundation plans to expand on the special strategic partnership allocation in our future Transparency Reports. Our goal is to enhance visibility into how these collaborations are structured and how resources are allocated, giving the DAO a clearer understanding of the impact on the Arbitrum ecosystem. At the same time, we remain committed to respecting any confidentiality provisions stipulated in such agreements. By balancing transparency with confidentiality, The Foundation aims to balance both the sensitivity of onboarding traditional institutions to Arbitrum and also providing updates to the DAO on how the funds are being spent.\n\nOur goal with this proposal is not to maintain the status quo, it is to ensure that we can continue to foster ecosystem growth through strategic partnerships. The funds will not be used for Arbitrum Foundation operating expenses, including marketing, operations, service providers, or existing signed agreements.",
