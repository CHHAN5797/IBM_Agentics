        "body": "[TEMP CHECK] Add FBTC to Aave v3 Main Instance on Ethereum\nAuthor: @ACI\nDate: 2024-11-01\n\nSummary\nThe proposal aims to onboard Ignition’s FBTC, to the Aave v3 protocol Main Market on Ethereum.\n\nMotivation\nFBTC is a cross-chain BTC protocol that uses the Threshold Signature Scheme network to enable secure, decentralized Bitcoin scalability across multiple blockchains. By leveraging multi-party computation, FBTC strengthens bridge security, safeguarding user assets and ensuring robust cross-chain interoperability. This setup also integrates a cross-chain hub, allowing seamless BTC transfers while reducing issues linked to Bitcoin L2 growth.\n\nThis new asset will broaden opportunities for Bitcoin holders aiming to participate in DeFi on Aave v3. The introduction of FBTC offers users more flexibility in leveraging their Bitcoin, enhancing liquidity and driving increased engagement within the Aave protocol.\n\nWith $480M in total value locked (TVL), FBTC is emerging as a compelling solution in Bitcoin bridging, supported by its upcoming Chainlink Oracle integration to accelerate growth across EVM networks. Aave stands to gain significantly as a primary partner in this expansion, following the successful playbook of cbBTC, which quickly scaled through similar collaborative efforts.\n\nSpecification\nTicker: FBTC\n\nContract address on mainnet: 0xC96dE26018A54D51c097160568752c4E3BD6C364\n\nChainlink oracle: upcoming\n\nProject: https://fbtc.com/\n\nReserves addresses: Bitcoin Reserve Address | FBTC\n\nProof of Assets dashboard: FBTC proof of assets dashboard\n\nGitHub: GitHub - fbtc-xyz/fbtc-contract\n\nDocs: https://docs.fbtc.com/\n\nAudit: fbtc-contract/audits at main · fbtc-xyz/fbtc-contract · GitHub\n\nTwitter: x.com\n\nRisk Parameters will be provided by Risk Services Providers at the earliest possible and ARFC will be updated with that feedback.\n\nDisclosure\nThe ACI is not directly affiliated with Ignition and did not receive compensation for creation this proposal.\n\nNext Steps\nIf consensus is reached on this [TEMP CHECK], escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\nIf the Snapshot outcome is YAE, this proposal will be escalated to ARFC stage.\nPublish a standard ARFC, collect community & service providers feedback before escalating proposal to ARFC snapshot stage.\nIf the ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, publish an AIP vote for final confirmation and enforcement of the proposal\nCopyright\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.",

        "body": "## Author: @Trident Digital Technologies\n## Date: 2024-11-05\n\n---\n\n### Summary\n\nThe proposal aims to onboard Paxos PAXG stablecoin, to the Aave v3 protocol Main Instance on Ethereum. $25K in lending incentives will be available over the three months following launch of the initiative, additionally further rewards may be made made available based on performance and/or utilization targets of the pool if for ex. significant TVL milestones are hit.\n\n### **Motivation**\n\nPAXG, a gold backed digital currency offered by Paxos is NYDFS approved and has a multi year track record on chain. With Paxos as a centralised and trusted entity in the cryptocurrency industry, PAXG brings a unique value proposition focused as the premier on chain gold asset\n\nOnboarding Paxos's PAXG extends Aave Protocol's already diverse collateral offering to its users. PAXG users on Aave Protocol will be able to utilize the value of their holdings without giving up their exposure to gold. Introducing PAXG is expected to increase liquidity and engagement within the protocol.\n\nOnboarding PAXG aligns with Aave DAO commitment to offering diversification across widely held and in-demand resources. It will enable users to tap into Paxos’s liquidity and reputation while benefiting from Aave’s established lending and borrowing functionalities. PAXG is expected to benefit from a major integration like Aave Protocol and over time is expected to attract more mainstream users to Aave, contributing to the overall growth and adoption of both on-chain gold and the Aave protocol.\n\n### **Specification**\n\nTicker: PAXG\n\nContract address: 0x45804880De22913dAFE09f4980848ECE6EcbAf78\n\nRisk Parameters will be provided by Risk Services Providers at the earliest possible and ARFC will be updated with that feedback.\n\n### **Disclosure**\n\nTrident is affiliated with Paxos and may receive compensation for efforts undertaken herein. ACI (Aave Chan Initiative) is not afiliated with Paxos and has not received compensation for escalating this proposal.\n\n### **Next Steps**\n\n1. If consensus is reached on this [TEMP CHECK], escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n2. If the Snapshot outcome is YAE, this proposal will be escalated to ARFC stage.\n3. Publication of a standard ARFC, collect community & service providers feedback before escalating proposal to ARFC snapshot stage.\n4. If the ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, publish an AIP vote for final confirmation and enforcement of the proposal.\n\n### **Copyright**\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.",

        "body": "---\n\nTitle: [TEMP CHECK] Onboard RSR to Aave v3 \n\nAuthor: Reserve Protocol Core Team & ACI (Aave Chan Initiative)\n\nCreated: 2024-01-24\n\n---\n\n# Summary:\n\nThe Reserve Protocol Core Team proposes adding Reserve Rights (RSR) as an asset in AAVE V3 on Ethereum Mainnet. Reserve drives liquidity on AAVE lending markets through the underlying baskets of RToken collateral and demand for borrowing RSR will bring additional fees to AAVE. Reserve will also make available Curve ecosystem voting power to deepen GHO liquidity through a GHO-eUSD Curve pool.\n\n# Motivation:\n\nReserve is a free, permissionless platform on Ethereum mainnet to build, deploy and govern asset-backed currencies referred to as “RTokens.” RTokens are always 1:1 asset-backed, allowing for permissionless minting and redeeming on-chain by users without the need for any middlemen. The Reserve Protocol launched on Ethereum mainnet in Oct 2022, Base in Oct 2023, and completed its fifth audit in Feb 2023.\n\nRSR is the governance token for Reserve Protocol and can be staked on a particular RToken, where it has two roles:\n\n1. RToken Overcollateralization: Staked RSR receives a portion of the RToken collateral’s revenue in exchange for being the first capital-at-risk in the case of collateral default\n\n2. RToken Governance: Staked RSR proposes and votes on changes to the RToken’s configuration\n\nRSR contract has been live on ethereum for 1.5 years, has undergone audits by Solidified, and the dev team recently burned the multisig Pause Transfer functionality, making it immutable. RSR currently has a marketcap of $139m.\n\nThree of the RTokens already live on the protocol are High Yield USD (hyUSD) is a secure high yield savings dollar with up to 8% APY expected to outpace the rate of inflation in over 100 countries around the world. ETHPlus (ETH+) is a safety-first diversified ETH staking index with up to 4.5% APY. Electronic Dollar (eUSD) is a hyper-resilient stablecoin built to endure black swan events, recently proving itself during the run on Silicon Valley Bank.\n\n## Benefits of listing RSR:\n\nAn RSR lending market would fuel Reserve Protocol growth and TVL across Ethereum and Base networks. As the Reserve ecosystem expands, AAVE TVL grows because a portion of RToken collateral assets are held on AAVE lending markets for example, the largest RToken is currently eUSD ($17.7m TVL) which holds 50% of its collateral basket in USDC and USDT lending on AAVE.\n\nAdditionally, demand for RSR borrowing could create more fees for Aave.\n\nReserve Protocol is also open to providing seed liquidity for the asset.\n\n# Useful Links:\n\nProject: https://reserve.org/\nProtocol Documentation: Reserve Protocol Docs\nRSR Documentation: Reserve Protocol Docs | RSR\nGithub/Source Code: Reserve · GitHub\nRSR Contract (Ethereum): Reserve Rights: RSR Token | Address 0x320623b8E4fF03373931769A31Fc52A4E78B5d70 | Etherscan\nRSR Oracle: Chainlink: RSR / USD Price Feed | Address 0x759bBC1be8F90eE6457C44abc7d443842a976d02 | Etherscan\nDune Dashboard: https://dune.com/reserve-protocol/reserve-protocol-overview\nBlog: https://blog.reserve.org/\nAudits: Reserve has been audited 5 times, RSR was audited by Solidified\nCommunities: Discord 3K, Twitter 111K, 104 GitHub stars\nRSR Price: CoinGecko, CoinMarketCap\n\n\n# Disclaimer:\n\nThis proposal is powered by Skywards.

This is a logical extension of the work Steakhouse is doing as Lido DAO’s Finance Workstream, and is a work in progress proof of the crucial role that Lido stETH can play in helping restaking become more efficient, while preserving the decentralization of Ethereum.\n\nThe onboarding of steakLRT to the Aave v3 Lido instance aims to enhance the diversity and robustness of the Aave ecosystem by integrating a novel restaking token. \n\nsteakLRT, built on Mellow and Symbiotic, brings unique value propositions and additional yield opportunities through boosted points programs. By including steakLRT, we can continue to attract user deposits from restaking narratives and support the further growth of a Lido instance. Further, beacuse steakLRT accepts wstETH deposits, there are strategic programs that can be run to increase wstETH deposit yield through looping strategies and liquidity mining. These will continue to make the Aave v3 Lido Instance the best place to deposit wstETH as collateral. \n\n### **Proof of Liquidity and Deposit Commitments**\n\nMellow and Symbiotic deposits held as LRTs like steakLRT earn Symbiotic and Mellow points. \n\nMellow will do an additional boosted points program for deposits into the Aave v3 Lido instance. \n\n### **Specification**\n\nContract address: [0xbeef69ac7870777598a04b2bd4771c71212e6abc](https://etherscan.io/address/0xbeef69ac7870777598a04b2bd4771c71212e6abc)\n\nRisk Parameters will be provided at ARFC Stage by Risk Service Providers.\n\n### **Useful Links:**\n\nsteakLRT announcement post: https://hackmd.io/@SteakhouseFi/steakLRT\n\nsteakLRT Mellow Vault: https://app.mellow.finance/restake/ethereum-steaklrt\n\n### **Disclaimer:**\n\nThis proposal is powered by Skywards. ACI is not directly affiliated with Steakhouse and did not receive compensation for creation this proposal.\n\nSome ACI team members are investors in Mellow.\n\n### **Next Steps**\n\n1. If consensus is reached on this [TEMP CHECK], escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n2. If the Snapshot outcome is YAE, this proposal will be escalated to ARFC stage\n3. Publication of a standard ARFC, collect community & service providers feedback before escalating proposal to ARFC snapshot stage\n4.
