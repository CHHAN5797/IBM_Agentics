Users can freely mint BNBx in exchange for BNB deposits and earn yield from staking.\n\nThe Aave-Chan Initiative supports LST diversity in Aave V3 and looks to add more LST to the new BNB Chain deployment.\n\n## **Specification**\n\nContract address: [0x1bdd3cf7f79cfb8edbb955f20ad99211551ba275](https://bscscan.com/token/0x1bdd3cf7f79cfb8edbb955f20ad99211551ba275)\n\nDetailed risk parameters will be formulated and shared in the ARFC phase, after positive community feedback from this TEMP CHECK.\n\n**Useful Links**\n\n- Website: https://www.staderlabs.com/\n- BNBx docs: https://binance.docs.staderlabs.com/\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThe ACI is not presenting this TEMP CHECK on behalf of any third party and is not compensated for creating this ARFC.\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. If consensus is reached on this [TEMP CHECK], escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n2. If the Snapshot outcome is YAE, this proposal will be escalated to ARFC stage\n3.

It currently has over $250m in TVL and is one of the largest Mellow restaking vaults. \n\nAdding rstETH to the Aave v3 Prime instance brings additional synergies for all stakeholders.\n\nrstETH will add additional demand for wstETH borrowing, making the wstETH looping more favorable for the main users. Incentives from P2P and other members of the Symbiotic and Mellow ecosystem can bring additional wstETH liquidity to the Prime instance, bolstering the existing liquidity mining campaigns.\n\n## **Chain to be deployed/listed**\n\nAave v3 Prime instance on Ethereum\n\n### **Proof of Liquidity and Deposit Commitments**\n\nStakeholders in the ecosystem have expressed support for liquidity commitments and incentives. We invite relevant members of the community to provide further details on these during the TEMP CHECK comment phase. \n\n## Specification\n\nrstETH: [0x7a4EffD87C2f3C55CA251080b1343b605f327E3a](https://etherscan.io/address/0x7a4EffD87C2f3C55CA251080b1343b605f327E3a)\n\n### Risk Parameters:\n\nInitial Risk Parameters will be provided by Risk service providers during the ARFC phase.\n\n## **Useful Links**\n\n[P2P](https://p2p.org)\n\n[Documentation](https://docs.p2p.org)\n\n[Github](https://github.com/p2p-org)\n\n## **Disclaimer**\n\nThe Aave Chan Initiative is not directly affiliated with P2P and did not receive compensation for creation this proposal.\n\n## **Next Steps**\n\n1. Period of comment on this TEMP CHECK.\n2. TEMP CHECK Snapshot vote for this proposal. \n3.

With Paxos as a centralised and trusted entity in the cryptocurrency industry, PAXG brings a unique value proposition focused as the premier on chain gold asset\n\nOnboarding Paxos's PAXG extends Aave Protocol's already diverse collateral offering to its users. PAXG users on Aave Protocol will be able to utilize the value of their holdings without giving up their exposure to gold. Introducing PAXG is expected to increase liquidity and engagement within the protocol.\n\nOnboarding PAXG aligns with Aave DAO commitment to offering diversification across widely held and in-demand resources. It will enable users to tap into Paxos’s liquidity and reputation while benefiting from Aave’s established lending and borrowing functionalities. PAXG is expected to benefit from a major integration like Aave Protocol and over time is expected to attract more mainstream users to Aave, contributing to the overall growth and adoption of both on-chain gold and the Aave protocol.\n\n### **Specification**\n\nTicker: PAXG\n\nContract address: 0x45804880De22913dAFE09f4980848ECE6EcbAf78\n\nRisk Parameters will be provided by Risk Services Providers at the earliest possible and ARFC will be updated with that feedback.\n\n### **Disclosure**\n\nTrident is affiliated with Paxos and may receive compensation for efforts undertaken herein. ACI (Aave Chan Initiative) is not afiliated with Paxos and has not received compensation for escalating this proposal.\n\n### **Next Steps**\n\n1. If consensus is reached on this [TEMP CHECK], escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n2. If the Snapshot outcome is YAE, this proposal will be escalated to ARFC stage.\n3. Publication of a standard ARFC, collect community & service providers feedback before escalating proposal to ARFC snapshot stage.\n4. If the ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, publish an AIP vote for final confirmation and enforcement of the proposal.\n\n### **Copyright**\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.",
