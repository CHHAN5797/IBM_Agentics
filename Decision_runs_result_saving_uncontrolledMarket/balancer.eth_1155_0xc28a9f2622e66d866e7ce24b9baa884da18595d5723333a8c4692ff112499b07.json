Future pxETH yield and pxETH withdrawals can be tokenized and used within DeFi. Further details about pxETH can be found in the whitepaper [here](https://github.com/redacted-cartel/pirex-eth-whitepaper/blob/master/pxETH_whitepaper.pdf).\n\nIn addition to the DEX liquidity for pxETH incentivized by Redacted DAO, the Dinero protocol has additional mechanisms to improve pxETH liquidity and support the pxETH:ETH peg in both normal and adverse market conditions allowing for greater pxETH DeFi composability.\n\npxETH can be redeemed for ETH from the Dinero protocol either instantaneously for ETH which has yet to be staked or via ETH which is unstaked from validators. In the future a novel incentivized withdrawal pool will facilitate quicker pxETH withdrawals when there is an ETH unstaking queue and/or adverse market conditions.\n\nThe governance token for pxETH is BTRFLY.\n\n**Motivation:**\n\nRedacted has a long and close relationship with Balancer and Aura. Because of this close relationship and Redacted’s vlAURA governance power, we want to have Balancer as the one of our primary venues for crucial pxETH liquidity.\n\nAn LST is only as good as its peg. Therefore for pxETH to be successful, significant liquidity is required. With a gauge, Redacted plans to use its governance power and bribes to direct emissions to the gauge and incentivize crucial pxETH liquidity on Balancer, allowing for higher volumes in the LP and also generating fees for veBAL holders.\n\n**Specifications:**\n\n1. **Governance:**\n\nRedacted’s governance is currently off-chain using [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/redactedcartel.eth). The multisig address is: 0xA52Fd396891E7A74b641a2Cb1A6999Fcf56B077e. Decisions relating to inflation, liquidity, partnership or DAO treasury go through a DAO vote, and then are executed by the multisig. On-chain governance will come at a later stage.\n\n2. **Oracles:** Does the protocol rely on external oracles? If so, provide details about the oracles and their implementation in the protocol.\n\nNo oracles are currently used.\n\n3. **Audits:** Provide links to audit reports and any relevant details about security practices.\n\nLink to all audits can be found [here](https://dineroismoney.com/docs/security).\n\n4. **Centralization vectors:** Is there any component of the protocol that has centralization vectors? E.g. if only 1 dev manages the project, that is a centralized vector. If price oracles need to be updated by a bot, that is a centralized vector. If liquidations are done by the protocol, that is also a centralization vector.\n\n4/7 multisig (0xA52Fd396891E7A74b641a2Cb1A6999Fcf56B077e) controls the pushing of validators public keys to the contract.\n\n5. **Market History:** Has the asset observed severe volatility? In the case of stablecoins, has it depegged? In the case of an unpegged asset, have there been extreme price change events in the past? Provide specific information about the Balancer pool: how long has it been active, TVL, historical volume? **You must provide a direct link to the pool AND a link to your pool's gauge.**\n\nThe pxETH/ETH pool has not yet been seeded. As explained above, pxETH has redemption mechanisms which allow the peg to be maintained/ arbitraged. Since launch on 2023/12/13, the main liquidity for pxETH is on Maverick (in anticipation of a gauge on Balancer).\n\n6. **Value:** Is this pool intended to be the primary source of liquidity for the token(s)? If this is not the case, explain the expected value add to Balancer (can this pool generate consistent fees?)\n\nWith a gauge, Redacted plans to use its governance power and bribes to direct emissions to the gauge and incentivize crucial pxETH liquidity on Balancer, allowing for higher volumes in the LP and also generating fees for veBAL holders.\n\n**Specification:**\n\nThe Balancer Maxi LM Multisig eth:`0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd` and call the addGauge function with the following arguments:\ngauge(address): `0xdee29b7b6dF3576280bFBbC088ee9eBAA767C0Bd`\ngaugeType(string): `Ethereum`",

As a result, users have an opportunity cost when providing liquidity since the other half of the ETH they provide does not generate any yield.\n> Therefore, the goal of this proposal is to utilize BAL incentives,Swap Fees and auto-bribes in order to mitigate this capital inefficiency effect.\n\n**Specifications:**\n\n> 1. **Governance:** ANKR token-holders can propose and vote for changes to the Ankr Staking system. If a change receives enough votes, the Ankr team implements the agreed-upon changes to the platform.

Pool deployed [here](https://etherscan.io/address/0xf16aEe6a71aF1A9Bc8F56975A4c2705ca7A782Bc). Gauge with 2% emissions cap deployed [here](https://etherscan.io/address/0x183D73dA7adC5011EC3C46e33BB50271e59EC976). \n\n**References/Useful links:**\n\n> Link to:\n    • [Website](https://alchemix.fi/)\n    • [Documentation](https://alchemix-finance.gitbook.io/user-docs/)\n    • [Github](https://github.com/alchemix-finance)   \n    • [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/alchemix)\n    • [Twitter](https://twitter.com/AlchemixFi)\n    • Other useful links: https://alchemix-stats.com\n\n**Protocol Description:**\n\n> Alchemix is a future-yield-backed synthetic asset protocol that gives users advances on various yield strategies via a synthetic token. Alchemix loans are self-repaying, interest-free and non-liquidating. Today, Alchemix offers various strategies to borrow against select USD-pegged stablecoins (alUSD) and ETH (alETH), with the intention of launching other synthetic tokens in the future.\n\n> ALCX is the governance token for the community DAO.  \n\n**Motivation:**\n\n> As part of the planned roll-out of veALCX, Alchemix would like to request a gauge for the newly created ALCX/ETH 80/20 pool. \n\n> The Alchemix veALCX system will have a few differences in comparison to existing ve-models - details can be found [here](https://alchemixfi.medium.com/vealcx-update-272e8900ac5a). The basis of the system will be staking for veALCX through 80/20 Balancer Pool Tokens. As such, the 80/20 ALCX/ETH pool will become the primary source of liquidity for ALCX on-chain, and it should drive significant volume and fees to Balancer and veBAL holders. For reference, the current primary pool on [Sushiswap](https://www.sushi.com/earn/eth:0xc3f279090a47e80990fe3a9c30d24cb117ef91a8) had (before migrating POL to Balancer) $8m TVL and, on average, generates >$500k in volume per day. While the new pool composition will likely affect these numbers, the total TVL in the pool should grow as well with the introduction of the ve-model.\n\n> Deployment of veALCX is still a while away; the exact launch date will depend on audit results. However, Alchemix would like to already start migrating the existing liquidity pool to the new 80/20 ALCX/ETH Balancer pool in anticipation of this launch. \n\n**Specifications:**\n \n1. **Governance:** \n\n    • Governance is conducted via forum posts and [Snapshot voting](https://snapshot.org/#/alchemixstakers.eth)\n    • There are two multisigs on Ethereum mainnet. The protocol treasury [24-hour timelock multisig](https://etherscan.io/address/0x8392f6669292fa56123f71949b52d883ae57e225). An operational (developer) [multisig](https://etherscan.io/address/0x9e2b6378ee8ad2a4a95fe481d63caba8fb0ebbf9) that is used to pay for expenses and execute transactions, and that holds LP positions and strategic assets.\n\n2. **Oracles:** \n\n    • The core protocol does not rely on oracles.\n\n3. **Audits:** \n\n    • Alchemix v2 has been audited by Runtime Verification as well as a public audit via code4rena. The protocol also offers a bug bounty programme via Immunifi.\n    • More details can be found [here](https://alchemix-finance.gitbook.io/user-docs/audits).\n    • ChainSecurity is currently engaged to audit the veALCX contracts. \n\n4. **Centralization vectors:** \n\n    • No centralization vectors exist in the core protocol beyond the multisigs described above.\n\n5. **Market History:** \n\n    • As a governance token and an unpegged asset, ALCX has experienced volatility since its launch. \n    • The current main source of liquidity is on Sushiswap, but ALCX is also listed on major centralized exchanges, such as Coinbase and Binance.\n    • The new Balancer 80/20 pool has been deployed recently and does not have a market history yet. However, Alchemix has seeded the market through a POL deposit (~$3.7m) described [here](https://forum.alchemix.fi/public/d/397-aip-82-part-1-approve-migration-of-alcx-liquidity-to-balancer).\n \n6. **Value:**\n\n    • The newly created 80/20 pool will become the primary source of liquidity for ALCX on chain. We expect that it will drive significant added value to Balancer, as the ALCX/ETH BPT tokens will be needed to receive veALCX and in order for users to participate in Alchemix governance, gauge voting, and boosted yield.\n\n**Contracts:**\n[Link to pool](https://etherscan.io/address/0xf16aEe6a71aF1A9Bc8F56975A4c2705ca7A782Bc)\n[Link to gauge](https://etherscan.io/address/0x183D73dA7adC5011EC3C46e33BB50271e59EC976)\n\nThe DAO Multisig `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` will interact with the AuthorizerAdaptor at `0x8F42aDBbA1B16EaAE3BB5754915E0D06059aDd75` and call performAction with the GaugeController at `0xC128468b7Ce63eA702C1f104D55A2566b13D3ABD` for the target(address) argument and using `0x3a04f900` followed by the gauge address `0x183D73dA7adC5011EC3C46e33BB50271e59EC976` and the corresponding gauge type for the `data(bytes)` argument.\n\ndata(bytes): `0x3a04f900000000000000000000000000183d73da7adc5011ec3c46e33bb50271e59ec9760000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000002`",

As a result, users have an opportunity cost when providing liquidity since the other half of the ETH they provide does not generate any yield.\n> Therefore, the goal of this proposal is to utilize BAL incentives,Swap Fees and auto-bribes in order to mitigate this capital inefficiency effect.\n\n**Specifications:**\n\n> 1. **Governance:** ANKR token-holders can propose and vote for changes to the Ankr Staking system. If a change receives enough votes, the Ankr team implements the agreed-upon changes to the platform. Further information may be found here: ANKR Governance Mechanics – Ankr\n> 2. **Oracles:** Rate provider for [ankrETH](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0xCb0006B31e6b403fEeEC257A8ABeE0817bEd7eBa).\n> 3. **Audits:** Ethereum Liquid Staking smart contracts have undergone an external audit by Beosin Blockchain Security. The full audit report may be found below:\n> [Ethereum Liquid Staking – Ankr](https://www.ankr.com/docs/staking/liquid-staking/eth/overview/#audit-details)\n> 4. **Centralization vectors:** Centralisation Vectors: The Ankr 2.0 whitepaper introduced the vision for Ankr Network as a decentralized system where independent node operators work alongside Ankr nodes to power the growth and development of Web3. Further detailed information may be found here:\n> [Delegated ANKR token staking – Ankr](https://www.ankr.com/docs/staking/delegated-staking/ankr/overview/)\n> 5. **Market History:** https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ankr-staked-eth\n> 6. **Value:** The pool is intended to be the primary source of liquidity for ankrETH liquidity on Arbitrum and allow for a healthy stimulation of volume.\n\nPool address: [0x004700ba0a4f5f22e1E78a277fCA55e36F47E09C](https://op.beets.fi/pool/0x004700BA0A4F5F22E1E78A277FCA55E36F47E09C000000000000000000000104)\nGauge address: [0x8e486dBACb74C00dd31e489Da93d99bbeBE36cd5](https://etherscan.io/address/0x8e486dBACb74C00dd31e489Da93d99bbeBE36cd5#code)\n\n**Technical Specification:**\n\nThe Balancer Maxi LM Multisig `eth:0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd` and call the addGauge function with the following arguments:\ngauge(address): `0x8e486dBACb74C00dd31e489Da93d99bbeBE36cd5`\ngaugeType(string): `Optimism`",
