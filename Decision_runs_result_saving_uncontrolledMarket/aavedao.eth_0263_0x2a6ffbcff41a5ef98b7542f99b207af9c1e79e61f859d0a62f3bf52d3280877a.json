        "body": "## Summary\nThis Snapshot aims to officially capture the community's agreement on adopting Chainlink Cross Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) to initiate the GHO cross-chain strategy. The details of the rollout plan and the configuration of risk parameters remain subjects for future governance discussions.\n\n## Motivation\nThe current limitation of GHO, which is primarily accessible only via minting on the Ethereum mainnet or through secondary markets, represents a significant constraint in its potential reach and utility across DeFi. We believe the future of GHO is to become a multichain asset where users can interact across various networks using GHO. Moving cross-chain increases the accessibility and liquidity of GHO for a larger spectrum of users.\n\nThe current moment is ideal for GHO to venture into new frontiers, and to facilitate this, it is essential to employ a solution that empowers users and stimulates growth. CCIP stands out for its high-speed and cost-effective token bridging, extensible compatibility to both EVM and non-EVM networks, ease of integration, and robust risk mechanisms. Aave Labs suggests implementing a canonical, unified cross-chain strategy for GHO using Chainlink's CCIP.\n\n## Specification\nAave Labs proposes using Chainlink [CCIP infrastructure](https://docs.chain.link/ccip) to move GHO across blockchain networks. This will allow the seamless transfer of the GHO token between source and destination networks. CCIP transfers tokens by locking/burning on the source chain and then releasing/minting on the destination network. Cross-chain GHO uses a combination of lock/release and mint/burn models, backing the aggregated liquidity across chains with locked GHO on Ethereum. Every destination chain will have a canonical version of the GHO token and an Aave Governance controlled facilitator with a specific bucket capacity.\n- Transferring GHO from Ethereum to another chain: GHO tokens get locked in a vault contract on Ethereum, GHO tokens get minted via Facilitator on the destination chain.\n- Transferring GHO from another chain to Ethereum: GHO tokens get burned via Facilitator on the other chain, GHO tokens get released from the vault contract on Ethereum.\n- Transfering GHO from one chain to another (none of them are Ethereum): GHO tokens get burned via Facilitator on source chain, minted via Facilitator on destination chain.\n\n![examples-ccip.png](ipfs://bafkreih46kvo7rrl4ylyobxyiqxis2kvplo7tqd223fje5zm2nooeut3eu)\n\nEach network will have a canonical version of GHO and a facilitator, controlled by Aave Governance, that will manage facilitator buckets and onboard GHO liquidity from Ethereum. The liquidity on each network will depend on the bucket capacity of the Facilitator and CCIP configuration (e.g. [rate limit](https://docs.chain.link/ccip/architecture#token-pool-rate-limit)). The total amount of liquidity across chains is always less than or equal to the amount of GHO tokens locked on Ethereum.\n\n## Next Steps\nOnce the community signals its consent for the implementation of CCIP to initiate the cross-chain strategy for GHO, the subsequent actions will be undertaken:\n- Initiate technical implementation process\n- Perform a thorough technical review to select the optimal networks for deployment.\n- Formulate a strategic rollout plan for the GHO cross-chain approach, in partnership with Risk Providers.",

A phased approach to the rollout will permit the DAO to initiate cross-chain GHO deployments in a controlled and secure manner, meticulously evaluating each step of the process and with time, sequentially broadening to additional networks.\n\nThe governance thread has functioned as an open and transparent platform for the DAO to gather information about potential opportunities for cross-chain GHO. Following the process outlined previously, and after receiving multiple network proposals and [insights from risk providers](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-rollout-plan-for-cross-chain-gho/17074/10), it is now time for the community to make a decision on the preferred network for the initial launch of the cross-chain GHO strategy.\n\n## Voting Options\nGiven the variety of network proposals submitted to the forum, below are the options for consideration (in order of when the proposals were received):\n1. Metis\n2. Avalanche\n3. Scroll\n4. Optimism\n5. Arbitrum\n\nEach network has been proposed as a potential candidate for initiating the cross-chain strategy of GHO. The community is now invited to review and decide on the most suitable network for this strategic expansion.\n\n## Next Steps\nOnce the community has expressed its preference for the initial network to implement the cross-chain GHO strategy, the governance discussion will progress to the ARFC stage. This phase will involve compiling all necessary details pertaining to the cross-chain strategy, enabling the community to review and formally signal its approval.",

Era empowers users with more security and embeds into the familiar infrastructure and ecosystem of EVM.\n\nzkSync Era has launched with a diverse array of DeFi offerings, listed in its ecosystem documents – and others on the way. Deploying Aave V3 on zkSync Era could provide opportunities for growth and collaboration between the Aave and zkSync communities.\n\nEra provides key EVM features, such as smart contract composability - leading to easier deployment of Aave V3 and requiring minimal development work.\n\n## Motivation\nThe Aave community has previously voted to deploy the Aave V3 codebase on zkSync’s v2 Testnet, approved by this off-chain vote. With the release of Era Mainnet, it is possible to re-invest the work of developers, empowering Aave as a hub for mainnet activity and liquidity.\n\nzkSync has the potential to benefit the Aave ecosystem by introducing new users into DeFi, and cementing Aave as the premier borrowing platform within this growing zk ecosystem. zkSync would benefit from having a flagship DeFi project like Aave on its platform, further diversifying and growing the DeFi options available to its users.\n\nContributing teams like the ACI have described this benefit well before: “EVM-equivalence allows deployment with little development work needed to adapt Aave to [a] new network.”\n\nAdditionally, ecosystem developers note “zkSync will further Aave’s expansion cross-chain, reinforcing Aave’s place as the top liquidity market.”\n\n## Specification\nThis TEMP CHECK presents the Aave governance with the opportunity to deploy Aave V3 on the zkSync Era Mainnet with a limited deployment of initial assets: USDC and ETH.\n\nSuggested risk parameters for these assets are provided in the table below.\n\nFlipside Crypto invites risk service providers ( such as @Pauljlei & @ChaosLabs) to provide feedback on these assets - as teams wait to confirm native or non-native versions of their token.\n\nWe hope this list grows as the network matures with more users and integrations:\n\n|Risk Parameter|WETH|USDC|\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|Isolation Mode|NO|NO|\n|Enable Borrow|NO|YES|\n|Enable Collateral|YES|YES|\n|Stable borrowing|N/A|NO|\n|Emode Category|N/A|N/A|\n|Loan To Value|80%|82.5%|\n|Liquidation Threshold|82.5%|85%|\n|Liquidation Bonus|5%|5%|\n|Reserve Factor|10%|10%|\n|Liquidation Protocol Fee|10%|10%|\n|Borrow Cap|N/A|10,000,000|\n|Supply Cap|25,000|25,000,000|\n|Debt Ceiling|N/A|N/A|\n|Base|0%|0%|\n|Slope1|7%|4%|\n|Uoptimal|45%|90%|\n\n## Disclaimer\nFlipside Crypto is not compensated in any form by zkSync or Matter Labs for creating this Temperature Check proposal. This TEMP CHECK has been prepared solely to facilitate community discussion.\n\n## Next Steps\n\n**ARFC**: If the Temperature Check Snapshot indicates positive sentiment, proceed to the ARFC stage for further discussion, risk parameter evaluation network analysis, and finalization of the proposal.\n\n**AIP**: If the ARFC stage Snapshot is successful, submit the proposal as an AIP for voting and on-chain governance approval.\n\n## Copyright\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.",

Integrate BGD Labs Infrastructure/technical evaluation report once available.\n2. Refine the ARFC based on community feedback and updated risk service provider recommendations.\n3. Submit the ARFC for a Snapshot vote for final approval.\n4. If consensus is reached, submit a deployment AIP to activate Aave V3 Base (upon Mainnet launch)\n\n## **Copyright:**\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.",
