They also offer advanced tools for large-scale monitoring and analytics to empower data-driven decision-making.\n\n\n## **Proposed Scope of Work for Arbitrum:**\n\nAs Research Members, our primary goal is to strengthen Arbitrum’s position as the leading Layer 2 solution. For any network, the core requirements are a strong developer mindshare and capture, projects that address both emerging and institutional use cases, and deep liquidity across the ecosystem. To address these challenges, we propose the following research initiatives for the first two months.\n\n\n### **1. Expanding Arbitrum’s Ecosystem: A Strategic Analysis of Emerging Untapped Sectors and Institutional Opportunities**\n\n\n\n* Arbitrum has long been a hub for DeFi protocols, and this will continue. However, with the emergence of new market cycles and innovative primitives, it’s crucial to understand and expand into these new areas, both crypto-native and institutional.\n* For example, Polymarket, a prediction market app, accounted for nearly half of Polygon’s transaction volume in October 2024. As new primitives emerge, Arbitrum must capture protocols from these sectors.\n* This research aims to assess where Arbitrum lags behind competing Layer 2 and Layer 1 networks. The study will explore:\n    1. Crypto-native sectors: prediction markets, memecoins, decentralized science (DeSci), gaming, decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePIN), etc.\n    2. Institutional sectors: Treasuries, payments, funds, and bonds\n* We will conduct a data-driven analysis to identify key sectors with little to no presence on Arbitrum, evaluate their growth potential, and develop strategies to attract these protocols to the network.\n\n    Final Outcome: A comprehensive report identifying high-potential crypto-native and institutional sectors currently underrepresented on Arbitrum to develop targeted strategies for attracting protocols and expanding network dominance beyond DeFi.\n\n\n\n### **2. Catalyzing Capital Migration from Ethereum Mainnet to Arbitrum: A Strategic Framework for Liquidity Attraction**\n\nEthereum Mainnet currently has more than $60B of Capital sitting on it. Currently, Arbitrum is leading in terms of attracting these outflows from the Ethereum main net, but with more L1s and L2s coming in it’s necessary to constantly research and strategise on how Arbitrum can be the home for this liquidity.\n\nOur main aim with this research is to analyse the patterns of large capital holders and their migration patterns from the mainnet and interview them to find out any gaps in terms of security, infrastructure, and opportunities.\n\n\n\n* Recent advancements — such as live fraud proofs, enhanced cross-chain infrastructure, and an increasing number of protocols building on Arbitrum—make it the ideal platform for this migration.\n* This research will:\n    * Analyse the risk profiles of large capital holders\n    * Assess the current infrastructure for migration and identify gaps\n    * Engage with capital holders through interviews to develop a strategy for attracting liquidity\n* Key areas of focus will include:\n    * Identifying infrastructural gaps that hinder capital migration\n    * Conducting user interviews to understand views on Layer 2 migration\n    * Analysing capital ownership on the mainnet and categorising entities by likelihood of migration\n    * Exploring short-term strategies and incentives to encourage both migration and long-term retention of liquidity on Arbitrum\n\n    Final Outcome: Develop a comprehensive strategy to facilitate and incentivize the migration of $50 billion in capital from Ethereum mainnet to Arbitrum by addressing security concerns, infrastructure gaps, and stakeholder needs.\n\n\n\n### **3. Diversifying Arbitrum’s Network Revenue Streams: Beyond Sequencer Fees**\n\nThis research initiative aims to address the critical challenge of developing sustainable revenue streams for the Arbitrum network, acknowledging that the current reliance on sequencer fees is not sufficient for long-term sustainability. The study will conduct a comprehensive analysis of potential revenue models, examining both traditional blockchain monetization strategies and innovative approaches unique to Arbitrum’s architecture.\n\n**Research Methodology (Overview)**:\n\n\n\n* Analyze successful revenue models from other blockchain networks.\n* Evaluate emerging trends in network monetization.\n* Assess the feasibility of implementing various revenue streams within Arbitrum’s existing framework.\n\n    Final Outcome: A report with supporting data/dashboards to identify and evaluate innovative, sustainable revenue models beyond sequencer fees to ensure Arbitrum’s long-term financial stability and present actionable implementation strategies to the DAO\n\n\n\n### **4. Developer Experience in the Arbitrum Ecosystem: A Comprehensive Analysis of Tooling, Support, and Cross-Chain Infrastructure**\n\n\n\n* The Arbitrum Orbit cluster is rapidly expanding, with over 50 Layer 2 and Layer 3 projects currently being built, making it one of the largest chain clusters today. Arbitrum has also launched its multi-VM smart contract framework, Arbitrum Stylus.\n* As the Orbit cluster grows and Stylus is in place, it’s important to identify infrastructure bottlenecks and challenges developers face.\n* This research will involve interviews with both existing and new builders to:\n    1. Assess the current state of developer tooling on Arbitrum\n    2. Identify support needed from Orbit chain teams for continued growth\n    3. Explore challenges around intra-chain and cross-chain messaging within the Orbit ecosystem\n\n    Final Outcome: An actionable framework to enhance Arbitrum’s developer ecosystem by evaluating current tooling infrastructure, support systems, and competitive positioning through extensive developer interviews and comparative analysis with peer networks.\n\n\n\n# **The Block Research**\n\n**Name of Applicant & Applicant’s Representative (If applicable):** The Block Research Team, represented by Abraham Eid, Alice Hou\n\n**Telegram Handle (if applicable)**: @Abraham_0000, @alice_hou\n\n**LinkedIn Profile (if applicable)**: Abraham Eid, Alice Hou\n\n**The role being applied for (choose one):** Research Working Member\n\n**Hourly Rate (in USDC):** 500 (for the whole 5-member team)\n\n\n## **Experience:**\n\nThe Block boasts over 5 years of experience, backed by a team of more than 35 research specialists. They have serviced over 135 clients across Web3, FinTech, VC, and traditional finance sectors, including conducting research for leading ecosystems such as Arbitrum, Ethereum, Polygon, Solana and Avalanche.\n\nNotable projects led by Block Research include guiding a $2B+ public gaming firm on its Web3 gaming market entry strategy, collaborating with billion-dollar blockchain platforms on competitive benchmarking and development strategies, informing token distribution strategies for prominent Layer 2 protocols, and co-developing institutional-grade crypto index products for top-tier funds requiring resilience in volatile markets.\n\n\n## **Proposed Scope of Work for Arbitrum:**\n\nArbitrumDAO stands at a point where refining its governance frameworks and improving its ability to measure community engagement can drive meaningful progress. Our proposed work in the first two months of the six-month term will focus on two key initiatives: exploring complementary governance models and developing a comprehensive community metrics dashboard to evaluate the social adoption of Arbitrum’s various product offerings. These initiatives address the DAO’s current challenges, combining structured research and data tools to support transparency, efficiency, and community engagement.\n\n\n### **Complementary Governance Models**\n\nThe need for scalable and effective governance is clear from past initiatives like the Gaming Catalyst Program, where issues such as lagged operations and limited measurable impact surfaced. To address these challenges, we propose researching, designing, and piloting governance models such as futarchy and quadratic funding.\n\n\n\n* Futarchy: This approach uses prediction markets to align governance decisions with measurable outcomes, ensuring that proposals are evaluated based on their projected success. We will conduct simulations to model how this approach could guide decision-making by analyzing hypothetical scenarios.\n* Quadratic Funding: This model supports fair resource distribution by emphasizing broad participation in grant programs and community initiatives. Our analysis will optimize funding allocations by examining voting behaviors, incentives, and projected impacts.\n\nIn designing these frameworks, we will deliver data-driven insights, including sensitivity analyses to explore how different variables (e.g., voter turnout, proposal costs) influence their effectiveness. Our work will culminate in a detailed proposal for governance experiments tailored to ArbitrumDAO, providing stakeholders with actionable tools to address governance challenges.\n\n\n### **Community Metrics Dashboard**\n\nA vibrant and engaged community is critical for the success of any ecosystem. Developers often assess the community dynamics of an ecosystem when deciding if to build. Similarly, investors and users look for signals that indicate the ecosystem’s health and momentum. However, existing metrics like Twitter & Discord follower counts fall short of capturing the nuanced sentiment and engagement within a community.\n\nWe propose developing a community metrics dashboard that aggregates a wide range of indicators to provide a comprehensive view of ecosystem activity. This framework will allow developers, investors, and users to “test the temperature” of the ecosystem with data-driven insights. The dashboard would track, but not be limited to:\n\n\n\n* Social Media Metrics: Twitter impressions, engagement rates, and Google Trends data to gauge interest and visibility.\n* Sentiment Analysis: Aggregating community opinions from forums, tweets, and developer discussions to understand emotional and social trends.\n* Engagement Metrics: Measuring active participation in Discord, Telegram, and GitHub to assess the vibrancy of the ecosystem.\n\nThis dashboard will not only help developers evaluate which technical stack to build on, but also assist investors in identifying promising projects, and users in understanding the ecosystem’s momentum. The ultimate goal is to establish a robust framework for assessing community sentiment and engagement that can set a new standard for the industry.\n\nThrough these efforts, we aim to provide ArbitrumDAO with structured governance models and a scalable framework for measuring community engagement. Together, these initiatives will help the DAO address its immediate challenges while laying the groundwork for sustained growth and ecosystem vitality.\n\n\n# **Llama Research & Castle Capital ([@dl_research](https://x.com/@dl_research) & [@castle__cap](https://x.com/@castle__cap))**\n\n**Name of Applicant & Applicant’s Representative**: DefiLlama Research & Castle Capital\n\n**Email Address**: ryan@dlnews.com, atomist@castlecapital.vc (please contact both)\n\n**Telegram Handle**: [@cryptodurs](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/cryptodurs) and [@atomist](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/atomist)\n\n**Role**: Research Working Member\n\n**Hourly Rate (in USDC)**: $100 per hour\n\n\n## **Experience:**\n\nDefiLlama Research and Castle Capital bring complementary expertise to the table.

[Unifying Arbitrum’s Mission, Vision, Purpose (MVP)](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/unifying-arbitrum-s-mission-vision-purpose-mvp/27275/1).\n\n\n### **1. Exploratory Research on Builder Retention & Expansion (Target = Applications)**\n\nProblem: Builders are not always aware of opportunities within the ecosystem or the possibilities that the tech stack unlocks, and once onboarded have limited support from the DAO.\n\nGoal: Identify and address key challenges in developer retention, ecosystem growth, and strategic alignment to recommend an effective builder expansion strategy.\n\nDeliverables:\n\n\n\n* Builder Needs Survey & Interviews: Identify pain points of current developers on Arbitrum One and Nova.\n* Developer Segmentation: Profile builders (DeFi, GameFi, infrastructure) for tailored support.\n* Competitive Benchmarking: Assess gaps vs. other layer 2 networks.\n* Strategic Recommendations: Propose clear steps to improve onboarding and incentives.\n\nPost Work Unlock: A clear pathway for an onboarding/ecosystem workstream to be set-up with a clear basis for a strategy to be created and implemented.\n\n\n### **2. Ecosystem-Building Initiatives (Target = DAO-Driven Development Programs)**\n\nProblem: Arbitrum lacks a competitive strategy to reward innovation, limiting its ability to attract and retain top-tier developers critical to its reputation as a home for disruptive builders.\n\nGoal: Position Arbitrum as the premier blockchain for innovation by optimizing grant funding and incentivizing novel protocols.\n\nDeliverables:\n\n\n\n* RPGF Analysis: Evaluate the impact of Retroactive Public Goods Funding (RPGF) models in competing ecosystems.\n* Innovation Grants: Propose funding mechanisms to reward long-term, high-impact projects.\n* Grant Prioritization: Identify top Arbitrum-aligned protocols for strategic funding.\n* Builder Engagement: Suggest strategies to strengthen relationships with existing projects.\n\nPost-Work Unlock: A roadmap for a grant-driven growth workstream to attract top builders and drive sustainable ecosystem expansion.\n\n\n### **3. Improving Orbit Chain Experience & Ecosystem Integration (Target = Ecosystem)**\n\nProblem: Orbit chains often feel disconnected from Arbitrum One and other orbits, with fragmented liquidity and suboptimal UX. While full interoperability relies on Offchain Labs, abstracting chain complexities can drive immediate improvements and enhance ecosystem cohesion.\n\nGoal: Address UX gaps, simplify chain abstraction, and align Orbit chains with the broader ecosystem while exploring future technical solutions as they mature.\n\nDeliverables:\n\n\n\n* Non-Technical UX Solutions: Propose immediate improvements to UX, including chain abstraction to streamline user interactions and reduce complexity.\n* Bridge Design Analysis: Compare intent-based bridges across ecosystems and suggest best practices for Arbitrum.\n* Messaging Layer Review: Evaluate existing messaging layer solutions for Orbit chains, focusing on user-centric abstraction of chain communication.\n* Alignment with Ethereum Plans: Analyse how proposed solutions align with Ethereum’s interoperability and chain abstraction strategies.\n\nPost-Work Unlock: Clear recommendations for improving UX and advancing Orbit chain adoption while leveraging chain abstraction for seamless user experiences.\n\nWe also plan to include the following projects in our Scope of Work, which are detailed in ‘Additional Details’ on the forum (i) Arbitrum’s Search for its Identity (ii) New Sector Mapping and Outreach.\n\n\n# **Blockworks Advisory**\n\n\n\n* Name of Applicant & Applicant’s Representative [If Applicable]:\n    * Blockworks Advisory\n        * Representatives: [EffortCapital](https://x.com/EffortCapital), [magicdhz](https://x.com/magicdhz), [GoldDefi](https://x.com/GoldDefi), [0xMims](https://x.com/0xMims)\n* Email Address:\n    * Blockworks Advisory: advisory@blockworks.co\n* Telegram Handle (if applicable):\n    * Blockworks Advisory representatives:\n        * @effortcapital, @magicdhz, @carolinagold, @Mims0x, @rmalakaib\n* Role being applied for: Research-Oriented Member\n* Hourly Rate (in USDC): $195/hr per individual\n\n\n## **Experience:**\n\nBlockworks has established itself as a premier source of deep technical and protocol-specific research over the past two and a half years. During its participation in ARDC V1, Blockworks played a pivotal role in recovering/saving over 3.7M ARB in misused or unallocated funds for the DAO and Foundation (e.g. Furucombo and Synapse) while also facilitating important discussions around Timeboost.\n\nAdditionally, they developed a comprehensive Arbitrum data dashboard, delivering valuable insights into the platform's on-chain activity and financial metrics. They also support other leading protocols such as the Solana Foundation, Lido, and Ethena among others.\n\n\n## **Proposed Scope of Work for Arbitrum:**\n\n\n### **1. Unified Incentives Framework (Incentive Program Design Assistance)**\n\nThrough our initial ARDC STIP work, Blockworks Advisory is uniquely positioned to assist in the development of the next incentive program scheduled to launch in 2025. Blockworks Advisory could work closely with the Incentives Working Group and other major stakeholders to create a Unified Incentives Framework that applies previous best practices and lessons learned to optimize ROI in various objective functions. While we will not administer the incentives or perform the operations (management, etc) we will help structure the proposal, and the program for the greater good of the ecosystem leveraging research accomplished. As the embargo on incentives ends in Q1, this would likely be our first deliverable, and would span 2 months worth of time in our term. Additionally, we believe this deliverable to be of great value to the DAO, given the DAOs past initiatives, STIP and LTIP, and the likely continuance of incentives post-embargo. The Foundation has also weighed in and has provided incentives as a suggested area of work for the Research member, found here - [https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrum-foundations-recommendations-for-ardc-deliverables/27686](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrum-foundations-recommendations-for-ardc-deliverables/27686).\n\nBelow are other deliverables that we can work on in addition to or besides the Incentive Framework.\n\n\n### **2. Timeboost Revenue Allocation Framework**\n\nWhile Timeboost is an innovative solution coming to Arbitrum that will likely be a positive catalyst for DAO revenue, there hasn’t been a community-wide discussion on how the revenue should be allocated and whether it makes sense for the DAO to capture all proceeds or redistribute it to impacted LPs/protocols.\n\n\n### **3. Orbit Chain Strategy**\n\nProvide the DAO with a path towards aligning the ARB token with the growth of the Orbit tech stack, taking lessons learned from other ecosystems (Cosmos, Polkadot, Optimism, zkSync, etc). Outlining a procurement vs ownership model where we identify what products/services the DAO should own (e.g RaaS, block explorer, data indexing, etc).\n\n\n### **4. General Data Services**\n\nSimilar to the [Multisig Support Service](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rfc-arbitrum-multi-sig-support-service-mss/23737) proposed by Entropy Advisors and R3gen Finance to reduce operational spend and increase proposal efficiency, Blockworks Advisory could become a shared data service provider that any Arbitrum working group or initiative (including the Foundation) could tap into to fulfill all data needs. We have the most [comprehensive](https://x.com/blockworksres/status/1853879698029527453) Arbitrum data in the industry, including DAO financials, and can leverage this to empower the various stakeholders in the community.\n\n\n### **5. Developer-centric Strategy Framework**\n\nIn last year’s [Developer Report from Electric Capital](https://www.developerreport.com/developer-report), Arbitrum saw a troubling decline in active developers in the ecosystem. This deliverable would be outlining the developer pipeline specifically in regards to Arbitrum, and provide suggestions for where DAO funding could possibly aid in the development process.\n\n\n### **6. Financial Audit of Arbitrum Grants Programs**\n\nThe Arbitrum Grants program is expansive, and a financial audit would simply be a retroactive analysis of the Arbitrum Grants program to date to determine ROI for the ecosystem.\n\n\n# **Messari**\n\n\n\n* Name of Applicant & Applicant’s Representative (If applicable): Messari Protocol Services\n* Telegram Handle (if applicable): @ jackpurdy @ alex_barry22\n* LinkedIn Profile (if applicable): [Messari | LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/messari/)\n* The role being applied for (choose one): Research Working Member\n* Hourly Rate (in USDC): $145/hour\n\nOur blended hourly rate of $145 reflects the expertise and resources required to deliver exceptional research and insights for the ArbitrumDAO.

The Coalition aims to execute turnkey R&D work on behalf of the Arbitrum DAO. The Coalition’s mandate is to help steer the path from ideation in the forum to the optimal, efficient, and safe execution of proposals. In other words, being a steward in making the DAO’s visions a reality. The coalition will provide the necessary resources so that the DAO can make informed decisions.\n\nMotivation\nThe Arbitrum forum includes many worthwhile suggestions, but often lacks the required research, coordination, design, and risk assessment to move forward optimally. For example, iterating on proposals, drumming up delegate awareness, and finding the necessary partners to execute an idea are often difficult tasks. The Arbitrum Coalition’s mandate is to help distill information and accelerate governance decision-making so DAO participants can make informed decisions.\n\nThe Coalition has best-in-class experience/specialized expertise and personnel to execute on this venture and are all already notable contributors to the DAO. Areas of expertise include but are not limited to research, framework creation, risk assessment, secure code reviews, threat modeling, and testing enhancements.The Coalition will take the necessary steps to ensure the Arbitrum DAO has the resources it needs to accomplish its goals.\n\nAs a case study demonstrating the need for the Coalition, there was a lot of discussion around returning tokens 3 accidentally sent to the airdrop address back to the recipients. However, there was no one to call on to look at the landscape of how other protocols deal with this issue, design and implement a mechanism, or take it through the governance process. Likewise, the DAO has seen multiple grant programs suggested but has not been able to assess what has worked or not worked for similar programs in the past from an objective perspective. A multitude of such cases can be seen over Arbitrum DAO’s short tenure. These are the exact roles the coalition will undertake for ideas that gain traction among DAO stakeholders.\n\nHad the coalition existed during the time of the STIP proposal, it would have played a pivotal role in alleviating many of the inefficiencies and challenges delegates faced in the process. Blockworks Research and Gauntlet would have been prepared to develop comprehensive resources in support of the program end-to-end. From simplifying the evaluation of proposals with concise explanations and quantitative analysis to simplifying the voting process for delegates, and ultimately eliminating the need for a second process aimed at finding a service provider to monitor and analyze the program once live, by doing it ourselves. While we did make modest contributions in this regard 4 [2 1], our commitment would have been backed by substantially greater resources. In addition, the Coalition would (and will, should this proposal pass) do its own analysis of how this STIP program performed (after the fact) and provide feedback and recommendations on how to improve it in the future. The Coalition would have advocated for streamlined voting methods in place of 105 separate votes and created efficient voting dashboards, reducing the reliance on last-minute community-funded solutions. While it’s a missed opportunity, it highlights the potential for future value.\n\nAdditionally, complex mechanism designs like creating a permissionless validator set (BOLD) and sequencer design (timeboost) can be made more easily understandable for ARB delegates with support from the Coalition and researched impartially versus other potential solutions when proposals of this nature inevitably go on the forum.\n\nThe Coalition will help community stakeholders make the best possible decisions when it comes to AIPs. For example, Trail of Bits will aim to review each onchain proposal’s source code to ensure it achieves what is stated. This code review ability is a feat many delegates cannot achieve on their own and will be extremely useful to enable competent voting. Blockworks Research will distill the competitive landscape and underlying technology and Gauntlet will be able assess potential risks to the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\nAn example that demonstrates the value the Coalition will provide relates to support decision-making for the Arbitrum Plutus DAO proposal to Activate ARB Staking 8. Adding an inflation rate to the token poses concerns around risks to the token, new independently created staking contracts would need to be audited, and it would be helpful if delegates had access to quantitative research surrounding how inflation has impacted other tokens in the past. The Coalition can work together to provide objective analysis, quantitative research, and, if desired by the community, audits and execution for this proposal and others like it.\n\nThe Arbitrum Coalition will help the DAO reduce friction and operate effectively. Having three of the most experienced service providers in crypto best positioned and resourced to act at the behest of the DAO will be a tremendous value add.\n\nRationale\nOne key difference between Arbitrum and many other protocols is the immense power given to the DAO at token generation, which makes the DAO fully responsible for the coordination and growth of the protocol.\n\nArbitrum’s impressive decentralization demonstrates that the DAO can’t rely on single entities such as Offchain Labs or the Arbitrum Foundation. Any steps taken to help create a robust decentralized ecosystem of service providers so that the DAO is not dependent on any single entity is a step in the right direction. This way if any one organization falls, is negatively regulated, or otherwise encumbered, the protocol continues to march forward. The Arbitrum Coalition is the first initiative toward this overarching goal.\n\nAdditionally, the Coalition will aid in bringing more service providers subservient to the DAO. For example, it can be a steward in creating a methodology for other budgeted entities to come into existence.\n\nOther DAOs have a diverse ecosystem of service providers who help the DAO operate efficiently. The Coalition will be the first entity working towards this overarching structure such that over time the DAO will have an ecosystem of service providers executing on key roles like grants, development, growth, risk, legal, and more. This is a necessity in maintaining a truly decentralized and efficiently operating DAO.\n\nTwo additional benefits to funding the coalition will be the professionalization of DAO undertakings and growth for Arbitrum. All representatives of the coalition are professional and will bring competent and effective work and communication into the DAO that should help proposals move along with less friction. Additionally, the entities involved have a combined audience of far over 500,000 and will be sure to produce public content on the work we do for the DAO to hopefully drive more users and developers into the ecosystem.\n\nThe Coalition’s purpose is not to replace delegates, but rather to support, serve, and empower both them and the community as a whole with tools and deep insights to streamline effective decision making.\n\nIntroduction to The Coalition\nTrail of Bits: Since 2012, Trail of Bits has helped secure some of the world’s most targeted organizations and devices. They combine high-end security research with a real-world attacker mentality to reduce risk and fortify code. They have worked extensively with Offchain Labs and performed over 1,800 hours of security review of Arbitrum through four focused engagements, including Nitro and Arbitrum V2. Many firms in DeFi, including Optimism, Balancer, Uniswap, and Compound 1 trust Trail of Bits expertise to help secure their code, and you can find many more in their Publications repository. They’ve succeeded in finding vulnerabilities in highly verified systems 1 and providing the best solutions regardless of whether they invented them. They are relentless about raising the baseline in the communities they work, and have developed and made freely available some of the most-used security tools, reference guides, and security 1 research in the industry.\n\nGauntlet: Gauntlet 3’s quantitative optimization solutions drive rapid and sustainable growth for DeFi’s top protocols, DAOs, and ecosystems through research 2, reports 2, products 2, and bespoke engagements 4. Gauntlet has the longest track record in DeFi risk management, with a managed peak at $40+B for DeFi protocols such as Aave and Compound.\n\nBlockworks Research: Blockworks Research 1 is a team of analysts that delivers institutional-grade data-driven research and analysis for L1s, L2s, DeFi, and gaming/consumer applications. Our team is well-known in the industry for producing high-quality, actionable research reports and data dashboards covering various topics, including L2s, dApps, tokenomics, technical upgrades, emerging trends, governance, MEV, and market analysis. The team is divided into protocol-specific coverage so that our analysts are experts in their respective niches. Blockworks Research is a branch of Blockworks 1, a media company hosting conferences, podcasts, and an editorial site.\n\nKey Terms\nThe Arbitrum Coalition (“the Coalition”): A group initially made up of Blockworks Research, Gauntlet, and Trail of Bits whose mandate is to empower delegates with resources for making the most informed decisions possible.\n\nDAO Advocate: A single designated entity that maintains the ability to direct the coalition’s efforts. Functions as a referee between the DAO and the coalition. We suggest L2BEAT fulfill the role of the Advocate as a proven good actor for the Arbitrum DAO given their contributions and status in the DAO. The advocate will receive a stipend of $8,000 per month for their work. The advocate’s main responsibility is ensuring the DAO’s best interests are met by the Coalition.\n\nCoalition Member Termination: Ultimately, and above all, this Coalition will exist to serve the Arbitrum DAO. As such, individual members of the Coalition can be considered for replacement if their service does not meet the standards of this proposal or the DAO’s expectation. In the scenario a Coalition Member is considered for replacement, the DAO will need to examine the list of alternative vendors as well as any new market entrants eligible for consideration and pass a vote through\na Snapshot vote (reaching quorum) to stop the following payments to the vendor and replace said entity with a counterpart. The Coalition member will be considered terminated upon the vote passing. The same process may be executed in order to terminate and stop the stream of funds for the entirety of the Coalition and/or the DAO Advocate.\n\nCoalition Member Exit: As a malleable entity, if a member of the Arbitrum Coalition wishes to exit for any reason, they may do so by providing a two week lead time of departure and offer a list of viable replacements. Payments to the Member will stop 14 days after notice is given.\n\nSpecifications\nThe advocate will have the ability to call on the coalition for R&D efforts at their discretion and act as the DAO’s representative to ensure that the Coalition is working on the most value-added initiatives and providing beyond satisfactory value. The advocate will solely act on the DAO’s behalf and function as a facilitator. From analysis, to modeling, to payload the Coalition will tackle and streamline workstreams together.\n\nThe roles of the Coalition include but are not limited to:\n\nTrail of Bits: Reviewing onchain upgrade proposals to ensure that they align with the design and specification of the proposal through whitebox source code reviews. This role is particularly important given the prevalence of governance attacks, as seen with Tornado Cash. When no proposal requires a code review, Trail of Bits will focus on building content to help review further proposals, including tools (dedicated Slither detectors, fuzzing harness, proposal state diff visualizer, … ) and educational material (tutorial, checklist, code walkthrough, …)\n\nGauntlet: Will empower the Arbitrum DAO with an understanding of the optimal path for growth through our quantitative work. Decisions in ecosystems, specifically DeFi, benefit from design, research, and modeling to determine how to incentivize usage, maximize economic efficiency, protect systemic health, and plan for the future with rigorously validated insights. Examples of some recent work include Aave Killswitch 1, Uniswap incentive design 1, ongoing Arbitrum USDC migration 1, and Cost of MEV: Quantifying Economic (un)Fairness in the Decentralized World 1.\n\nBlockworks Research: Will provide objective data-driven research surrounding proposals to help delegates understand the context, competitive environments, and make more informed decisions. These reports may also be used as a tool for those writing proposals to improve their work. Additionally, Blockworks Research will function as the project manager handling logistics such as communication with the DAO and speaking with delegates. BWR is also able to input on mechanism design.\n\nThe Advocate is not a part of the coalition and exists purely to facilitate the DAO’s interests and direct the coalition. The Advocate is a representative of the DAO.\n\nWe believe it pertinent to get The Coalition stood up with haste and that Blockworks Research, Gauntlet, and Trail of Bits make up ideal initial members. That said, The Coalition is a malleable entity that can change, expand, and contract in domains and members as the DAO wishes. The Advocate as L2BEAT, likewise, should be looked at as a temporary seat that is always open to change. At the end of the 12 month period the domains and members should be reevaluated based on performance, lessons learned, and the adapting needs of the DAO as expected for the following 12 months.\n\nProjects\nThe Arbitrum Coalition aims to provide the following services as a first priority\n\nForum Proposal Review [BWR]\nWill provide impartial data-driven research surrounding proposals to help delegates understand the context and competitive environments such that they can make more informed decisions. These reports may also be used as a tool for those writing proposals to improve their work. The Advocate will direct the frequency and research topics of this work.\nReview on chain proposal code updates [Trail of Bits]\nWhite box security review of source code through a combination of manual and automated review, which may include a review the proposal for design flaws and identifying security and correctness properties\nReviews do not include proposals that are initiated by Offchain Labs and the Arbitrum foundation. These proposals are already going through security reviews (including by Trail of Bits)\nJust-In-Time Quants [Gauntlet]\nGauntlet’s Applied Research 4 and Risk teams will deliver quantitative review, research, and modeling or simulation for DAO proposals and initiatives relating to economic risk, design, or optimization.\nArbitrum Ecosystem Risk Dashboard [Gauntlet]\nA public ecosystem risk dashboard, similar to Aave 3 and Compound 1, provides users, investors, and voters continuous visibility into market risk throughout the ecosystem. Market risk metrics will include Volatility, CEX/DEX liquidity, and Gauntlet Safety Ratings, to inform ongoing risk-return optimizations. Gauntlet will hold monthly Risk Training sessions on how to use the dashboard from deployment to adoption and beyond.\nService Provider Onboarding Framework [BWR]\nEstablish a framework that the DAO may choose to utilize as a tool for onboarding future service providers.\nThe framework will include potential requirements and criteria; solutions for checks and balances; onboarding and offboarding processes for additional service providers including but not limited to legal counsel, operations, engineering, and marketing. All potential service providers can be thoroughly vetted by BWR, if the DAO chooses, ensuring sufficient staffing and resource availability.\nFollowing the DAO signaling an appetite for such an activity, Blockworks Research can propose and host a service provider onboarding process. The initial proposal will attempt to allocate a budget of ARB that service providers can then apply to receive a portion of through an RFP. The DAO will then vote which service providers to onboard. Recruiting, criteria, the process, budgeting suggestions, and facilitation can be handled by The Coalition. Though BWR is happy to take the proposal through the process, the DAO may opt to use the framework in any capacity it wishes, including ones that exclude BWR from future involvement.\nProject Management [BWR]\nWill handle communication with DAO surrounding coalition activities. Additionally, it will be the point of contact for DAO stakeholders and service providers. Blockworks is responsible for the overall execution of the coalition, documenting its success, escalating issues, and recommending solutions. Blockworks will maintain its own governance process to ensure continuity.\nOnce the first priority services are met, the Arbitrum Coalition can provide the following. Though these are examples of activities that can be executed on, the DAO, through The Advocate, will have decision making power over the scope of the coalition’s work.\n\nTooling Creation and Enhancement [Trail of Bits]\n\nDevelop and enhance tooling to enhance the security of the Arbitrum ecosystem and its proposals, including:\nSpecific static analysis bug detectors targeting code update.\nDevelop fuzzing capabilities to test the validity of the new upgrade states and verify that the state changing will not break any invariant\nVisualize the state of the governance contracts, in particular: the state of previous proposals, current emitted and delegates votes, how the tokens are delegated,\nVisualize and verify correct encoding of values used in the governance contracts and the action contracts.\nEducational material [Trail of Bits]\n\nProvide educational material and guidelines for reviewing upgrades procedures, including: Tutorials, Checklists, Code walkthrough\nResearch New Mechanisms [BWR]\n\nObjectively analyze and contribute to the design of new and existing mechanisms such as sequencers, fraud proofs, data availability solutions, and more. All research will be data and evidence driven evidence, where available. Projects to be prioritized by The Advocate.\nDelegate Engagement [BWR]\n\nWill create processes that incentivize delegates to be more active contributors to proposals rather than passive reviewers. For instance, a delegate incentives framework with accompanying requirements. Additionally, host regular cadence calls with delegates and those that authored proposals to work together on iteration.\nGrowth Initiatives [BWR]\n\nWill produce content surrounding coalition activities. Blockworks Research’s podcast, 0xResearch, will feature a segment on a weekly basis throughout the coalition’s term that will discuss the latest updates in Arbitrum the protocol or governance. Additionally, Twitter threads and newsletter mentions will be regularly provided in order to attract more developers and users into the Arbitrum ecosystem.\nCosts\nThe total cost of the coalition for the 1-year term will be based on the 30-day VWAP price of ARB on the day prior to the onchain proposal. One quarter of payment will be paid upfront to each Coalition Member, with a 274 day stream of the following ¾ starting 91 days from the AIP’s execution. The stream of funds will remain in DAO control and can be cut off at any time through an onchain DAO proposal. As of the ARB price on October 25th, this proposal is estimated to cos",

This brings the potential total term to one (1) year.\n* Funding Structure Revision: A restructuring of the funding approach to better align with the updated objectives and framework.\n* Supervisory Council Composition: The Supervisory Council will have responsibilities at both macro and micro levels, ensuring comprehensive oversight, strategic alignment, and effective day-to-day operations. At the micro level, two (2) of the elected members will focus on communications and one (1) will focus on operations.\n* Supervisory Council Elections: Candidates will specify their preferred roles in the application form, but a single general election snapshot will still be conducted as initially proposed. If multiple top-ranking candidates choose the same role, the highest-ranking ones are selected for that role, while others are redirected to fill alternative roles based on their preferences.\n\n## 1. The Supervisory Council: Governance and Strategic Oversight\nOne of the key structural changes in ARDC V2 is the establishment of a Supervisory Council. The Council replaces the previous DAOAdvocate role in ARDC V1 and the proposed role of the Operations Lead, aiming to distribute governance responsibilities more equitably and improve both macro and micro-level oversight. This move is designed to enhance the strategic alignment of the ARDC with the ArbitrumDAO's long-term objectives, ensuring that resources are efficiently managed and that the working members remain accountable.\n\nThe Supervisory Council will be composed of three elected members, each with distinct roles:\n* Two members will focus on communications, ensuring clear and consistent information sharing between the ARDC, the ArbitrumDAO, and external stakeholders such as OffChain Labs and the Arbitrum Foundation.\n* One member will focus on operations, managing day-to-day activities, overseeing financial transactions, and maintaining operational transparency.\n\nEach member will serve a six-month term, with the potential for a six-month extension, depending on the outcome of a Snapshot vote. The introduction of the Council helps bridge the gap between the high-level strategic goals of the DAO and the granular operational needs of the ARDC, allowing for more nuanced management and decision-making. The Supervisory Council will also handle conflict resolution, oversee communication strategies, and mediate between the ARDC and DAO in case of disputes, ensuring that activities remain aligned with the DAO's best interests.\n\n## 2. The Retainer Model: Aligning Incentives with Deliverables\nAnother important improvement in ARDC V2 is the Retainer Model, which aims to reduce the risk of underutilization and misaligned incentives by directly tying payments to project needs. In this model, working members are compensated based on the hours they spend delivering on their tasks, rather than receiving a lump-sum payment upfront. The model follows a structured payment plan:\n* One-third of the total cap allocated to each working member’s role will be paid upfront, covering the first 1/3 set of hours.\n* The remaining two-thirds of the cap is tied to project-based deliverables and will be paid in phases: 50% upon commencement of each task, and the final 50% upon successful completion of the task.\n\nBy requiring applicants to submit hourly rates in their applications, the ARDC incentivizes competitive pricing and ensures that funds are allocated efficiently. The Supervisory Council oversees this process, approving deliverables and tracking the use of working hours to ensure that tasks are being completed as required. This model also mitigates the risk of \"pre-paid\" work not delivering the corresponding value, a challenge encountered during ARDC V1.\n\n## 3. Funding Structure and Extension Mechanics\nARDC V2’s funding structure has been designed with flexibility in mind, allowing the DAO to control costs while still maintaining robust operational capacity. The proposal outlines three funding options—Options A, B, and C—each corresponding to different caps for the Security, Research, and Risk verticals. These options offer varying degrees of financial commitment, allowing the DAO to choose the level of funding that best matches its needs and risk tolerance:\n* Option A allocates $1.73 million USDC for operations.\n* Option B allocates $2.09 million USDC, serving as a middle-ground option.\n* Option C allocates $2.60 million USDC for larger-scale operations.\n\nEach option includes compensation for the Supervisory Council, set at 90,000 ARB across the 6-month term (approx. $46,800 USD at the time of the proposal). The Snapshot voting system will allow the community to decide whether to fund the ARDC under one of these options, abstain, or reject the proposal outright.\n\nFurthermore, the extension mechanics give the DAO flexibility in deciding whether to continue with the ARDC after its initial term. At the end of the 6-month term, the DAO will have the following choices through a Snapshot vote:\n* Extend the ARDC with the same working members.\n* Extend the ARDC with a re-election of working members.\n* Choose not to extend the ARDC.\n\nIf the DAO opts not to extend the ARDC, any unutilized USDC and ARB will be returned to the Treasury, ensuring that funds are not wasted.\n\n## 4. Aera’s Protocol-Owned Execution: Streamlining Fund Management\nTo mitigate volatility and optimize the conversion of ARB into USDC for operational purposes, ARDC V2 will utilize Aera’s Protocol-Owned Execution strategy. This innovative fund management solution employs off-chain logic to monitor on-chain liquidity, model price impact, and execute trades in a way that minimizes slippage and market disruption.\n\nUsing  @aerafinance Vault —guarded by @gauntlet_xyz—ARB tokens will be converted to USDC through @odosprotocol and @bebop_dex, decentralized execution platforms designed for efficient liquidity sourcing.\n\nThe strategy leverages both active and passive execution techniques:\n* Passive execution involves setting concentrated ARB positions in an ARB/USDC liquidity pool, effectively creating limit orders to optimize the conversion process.\n* Active execution takes place during optimal market conditions, as determined by Aera’s price impact modeling, which tracks intraday and medium-term price effects of trades.\n\nThis dual approach ensures that the ARB-into-USDC conversion process is as cost-effective as possible, reducing the risk of adverse market impacts and preserving the value of the DAO’s assets.\n\n## 5. Risk, Security, and Research Seats: Building on ARDC V1\nIn ARDC V2, three specialized roles—Risk, Security, and Research—will build upon the foundations established during ARDC V1. These roles are designed to bring targeted expertise to critical areas of the Arbitrum ecosystem, ensuring focused attention on risk management, security, and research, which were key in delivering the 43 important outputs during ARDC V1 produced by @blockworksres, @chaos_labs & @OpenZeppelin\n\n1. Risk Seat: Ensuring Protocol Safety\nThe Risk Member focuses on evaluating and mitigating risks within DeFi protocols. This builds on work from ARDC V1, where Chaos Labs conducted risk analyses on protocols like @vertex_protocol and @pendle_fi , providing insights on economic efficiency and systemic health. In V2, the Risk Member will continue this work, offering quantitative risk assessments and strategic guidance on managing potential threats in the ecosystem.\n\n2. Security Seat: Fortifying Governance and Contracts\nThe Security Member ensures smart contracts and governance mechanisms are secure, expanding on the significant security evaluations performed by OpenZeppelin in ARDC V1. Their work will focus on bug detection, fuzz testing, and ensuring governance upgrades are secure—similar to ARDC V1’s BOLD Security Analysis and Arbitrum Governor V2 Review.\n\n3. Research Seat: Data-Driven Insights\nThe Research Member will provide objective, data-driven analysis on key topics like sequencers and fraud proofs, echoing the work done by @delphi_digital and @blockworksres in ARDC V1. Research outputs will support governance decisions and help guide the DAO's strategic direction, just as V1 delivered insights like the Arbitrum DAO Treasury Research and analysis of STIP programs.\n\n### Interplay Between These Seats\nTogether, the Risk, Security, and Research members form the backbone of ARDC V2’s specialized expertise. By focusing on their respective verticals, these members ensure that the ArbitrumDAO is equipped to handle the complex challenges of the DeFi ecosystem, from managing risks and securing smart contracts to fostering a data-driven approach to governance and innovation.\n\nThe Supervisory Council will oversee the performance of each of these members, ensuring that their work aligns with the strategic priorities of the ArbitrumDAO. Furthermore, this structure allows for flexibility in allocating resources to the most pressing tasks, whether those relate to immediate security concerns, risk management, or long-term research initiatives.",

        "body": "## Abstract\nHome to some of the best smart contract security researchers in the market and one of the strongest Developer Relations teams in the industry - professionals in Cyfrin come from backgrounds like Chainlink, Compound, Alchemy, Aragon, WorldCoin, Microsoft, Google, and other popular FinTech companies.\n\nThrough this proposal, Cyfrin would like to request $2M to improve and foster the security and longevity of the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\nWe will do this through launching the Arbitrum Security Enhancement Fund dedicated to sponsoring audits for Arbitrum projects.\n\n## Motivation\nBlockchains solve global issues no other technology today has been able to solve: verifiable accountability, unbiased data exchange, trust without intermediaries, online ownership, permissionless transactions, global identities, to name a few…\n\nYet, until Web3 is safe, it is not scalable.\n\nIn July, total losses in the DeFi sector breached $77B according to a report from CryptoSlate. In 2022 alone, DeFi experienced hacks resulting in losses of over $3.1B. In 2023, a staggering $2.3B has already been stolen, indicating a trajectory higher than the previous year.\n\nThis is a security problem, a best practices problem, and a branding problem - rightfully keeping away institutions and users from a world-changing technology. Not solving this makes any effort of making web3 mainstream, vain.\n \n![7dbb9b4b71e82d06bc9ed50d172fbd4f740875d5.png](ipfs://bafkreig3zhjhipa7wcbmrhahe3smkhj6ytridrczvc4gizwkkkliyordde)\n    \nEvery time there is a hack on an Arbitrum project, both the Arbitrum ecosystem and the entire industry, suffer.\n\nGetting this right increases adoption at scale. Value exchange technologies without developers capable of using them appropriately have a hard time succeeding. Value exchange technologies with developers and protocols lacking security best practices create an unsafe environment for everyone participating.\n\n– The future of crypto hinders on projects prioritizing smart contract security.\n\nCyfrin commits to leveraging our team of industry experts to strengthen, support, and secure Arbitrum’s ecosystem and its developers.\n\n## Rationale\nLeveraging our auditing, engineering, and educational skill sets, the Cyfrin team will keep projects built on Arbitrum and its users safe. Through this proposal, Cyfrin aims to contribute to the long-term success of the Arbitrum ecosystem through attracting incoming TVL for the Arbitrum ecosystem, gain user trust, and show traction to potential future investors.\n\nLaser-focused on Web3 security, Cyfrin is a market leader in smart contract audits. Cyfrin offers everything from private audits to competitive public and private audits, as well as a multi-phase auditing approach we’ve designed to ensure stronger security guarantees.\n\n![eef6f8ad9af263c4f7d23396654d6993e05d7dcd.png](ipfs://bafkreigtdj7fs7vq3fy2jdavaghommp3ha5vrtd4727gvrqhmwipf6uptm)\n\nAdditionally, you may find case studies for Oku Trade and SudoSwap to learn more about how Cyfrin works.\n\nSome testimonials from clients:\n\n“It was a pleasure to work with the Cyfrin team. Their approach to security and meticulous testing is exceptionally thorough. Additionally, their intimate knowledge of the Chainlink protocol made them particularly useful for our audit.” - Getty Hill, Oku Trade Founder\n\n“Working with Cyfrin feels like a true partnership — they are just plain good at what they do and above all are as motivated as anyone to move our industry’s security practices forward” - Beanstalk\n\n“Working with Cyfrin was a good experience, they kept in touch throughout the entire audit, and also followed up post-launch. Competitive with the best of the firms.\" - 0xmons from Sudorandom Labs\n\nThrough this proposal, we’re asking Arbitrum to fund a Security Enhancement Fund to audit projects built on its infrastructure. The fund will allocate funds to private, competitive, or multi-phase audits for projects built on Arbitrum.\n\nCyfrin will power the long-term success of Arbitrum protocols, so protocols feel safer going to market and users more comfortable interacting with the Arbitrum chain.\n\n## Key Terms\nAudit: An audit is a service where a security researcher reviews a codebase in depth with the intent of finding potential vectors for exploitation. Once completed, a report is presented to the protocol to fix any potential vulnerabilities found.\n\nPrivate audit: A team, consisting of usually 2-3 security researchers, spends weeks looking at a protocol’s codebase with the aim of finding the most critical exploit vectors in a codebase, as well as perform architecture analysis, fuzz testing, improvement pull reviews, etc.\n\nPublic Competitive Audit: An audit where hundreds, if not thousands, of security researchers review a codebase and compete for funds in a set reward pool based on the complexity of vulnerabilities found, its impact, and its uniqueness.\n\nPrivate Competitive Audit: An invite-only audit where a protocol invites top-performing auditors to review their code and compete in community driven audit competition.\n\nMulti-Phase Audit: a new, innovative model known as the Diverge-Converge Multi-Phase Model. Crafted to maximize the quality of audits, a critical aspect in the Web3 space, by strategically incentivizing auditors and ensuring that the protocol codebase goes through at least three comprehensive auditing phases, enhancing the protocol’s ultimate security.\n\n## Specifications\nThe entirety of the funds will be allocated towards funding security reviews for protocols, including the costs to run the audits, hire auditors, promote contests, bring judges, do customer support, and competition moderation.\n\nThe Fund will match up to 60% for the audit requested. The remaining amount will have to be paid by the project itself requesting for funding. This is mostly to weed out projects just looking for a free audit, ensuring we’re truly enabling long-lasting impact for the ecosystem.\n\nThe one exception to this rule is projects who are already deployed on Arbitrum and who can prove a high number of active users, total value locked, or who provide user retention and stickiness across the Arbitrum ecosystem as a whole. Establishing the details of what “high” means in this case will be a task of the Allocation Committee once formed.\n\nThese audits may come in the form of competitive audits, through our CodeHawks platform, private audits through our security research team, or through our multi-phased approach combining the above.\n\n## Audit Types\nCompetitive Audits\nCodeHawks, one of the leading competitive auditing platforms in the market and home to some of the top security experts in the industry, enhances the security of protocols through community-driven smart contract security reviews.\n\nOn CodeHawks, hundreds of auditors study, test, stress, and review the same protocol’s codebase for a defined amount of time - finding bugs and potential exploit vectors. Auditors then submit the findings to the platform for judge review and monetizing based on the vulnerabilities uncovered.\n\nPrivate Audits\nPrivate audits, an option tailored to yet-to-be deployed, and already-live protocols. A hand-in-hand relationship between protocol’s engineering team and our security research squad is formalized to uncover vulnerabilities and support developers with state-of-the-art best practices guidance.\n\nThrough constant communication, the protocol’s engineering team is able to revise vulnerabilities as soon as they’re found - ensuring the team can start working on fixes immediately. Auditors also provide architecture analysis, fuzz testing, improvement pull reviews, specific knowledge like formal verification, code smells, testing feedback, etc.\n\nMulti-phase Audits\nDesigned for large and more complex protocols, the Multi-Phase audit approach has the stronger security guarantee of them all since it encourages the protocol to go through several audit phases before completing the final report.\n\nTo learn more about the Multi-Phase Audits, review here. \n\n![94de3d610083fec1fdc4d0cd35c1720832865f5b.png](ipfs://bafkreiauxpn2v4ymg4djs22mshbdtzucp73zr62byswrmto5dzr7fzqloq)\n\n## Allocation Committee\nThe Allocation Committee is the group responsible for determining which projects should receive audit funding. Cyfrin will lead the charge of setting this Committee up within 2 weeks of proposal approval.\n\nThe multisig account for the Allocation Committee will contain 5 people (3 from Arbitrum’s side, 2 from Cyfrin). Each team (Cyfrin and Arbitrum) will select who from their organizations will represent them in the Allocation Committee within 10 days of proposal approval.\n\nOnce composed, the committee will determine any additional eligibility criteria and share them with the community before opening up the application funnel. The application funnel should open within a maximum of one month post proposal approval.\n\nAdditionally, the Allocation Committee is responsible for defining the appropriate application process and reviewing applications on a recurrent basis. The process for reviewing these applications, as well as how often the Committee meets will be determined by the members based on the amount of applications received and their complexity.\n\nWe saw the community gather together under the STIP proposal and would like the same community participatory process to guide the direction of how the fund allocates the distribution. It’s a discovery process that we will run, partnering with Arbitrum to validate findings and iterate repeatedly.\n\n## Eligibility criteria for protocols applying to the Security Enhancement Fund\nThe Security Enhancement Fund aims at improving the security of all projects that have already deployed or will be deploying into the Arbitrum chain.\n\nAny protocol that adds value to the Arbitrum ecosystem across DeFi, Gaming, DAOs, or social projects, real world assets tokenization, track and trace solutions, or any other track, bringing a healthy and sustainable contribution to the ecosystem, is welcomed to apply.\n\nProjects should have already deployed to Arbitrum mainnet to apply, although exceptions can be made for:\n\nProtocols who commit to deploying on Arbitrum within 6 months of the audit - if this is the case, the code being audited must be deployed exclusively on Arbitrum for 6 months before launching elsewhere. The Allocation Committee will determine when taking such a risk is worth the assessment.\n\nProtocols who already have deployed and gained traction on other chains, looking to deploy to Arbitrum as well - if this is the case, information regarding the protocol’s TVL, active user base, and Arbitrum strategy should be shared in the application for review by the Allocation Committee.\n\n## Ineligible Projects\nIn an effort to keep the Arbitrum ecosystem secure and sustainable, we comply and leverage Arbitrum’s guidelines 2 to determine which projects are ineligible to apply for the Security Enhancement Fund.\n\nAdditionally, the Allocation Committee may establish additional guidelines for ineligible projects.\n\n## Security Enhancement Fund Distribution\nThe 100% of the funds from the Security Enhancement Fund will be used to audit Arbitrum projects.\n\nThe fund allocation per project will cover 60% of the protocol audit, expecting the protocol to cover the rest. The reasoning behind this is to ensure only protocols serious about their long-term growth get audited. However, an exception of sponsoring 80% of the audit could be made for unique situations as established by the Allocation Committee, like for a protocol amounting for large ecosystem growth or a large protocol deploying to Arbitrum.\n\nThis makes it extremely convenient for protocols built on Arbitrum to enhance the security of their codebase and protect users’ assets.\n\nAudit prices are aligned with industry standards and calculated based on the complexity of the codebase under review.\n\nFor competitive audits, the prize pool is calculated as approximately $30 multiplied by the number of lines of code in the code base.\n\nFor private audits, the cost is calculated as $60,000 multiplied by the number of weeks required by the auditors to read, understand, and review the code base in scope. The time required for each audit is evaluated before the security review by the lead auditor assigned to the project and will be made publicly available to the community.\n\nProtocols are permitted to undergo one or multiple smart contract security reviews per protocol update. The number of reviews is determined based on the codebase size, as indicated below:\n\nFor codebases or protocol updates with less than 5000 nSloc, security reviews will be limited to 1 per type.\n\nFor codebases or protocol updates with more than 5000 nSloc, security reviews will be limited to 2 per type.\n\nnSloc is an objective measure and industry that stands for Normalized Source Code. Calculated reducing all multiline functions declarations to a single line, removing all comments and empty lines and counting the remaining number of lines of code.\n\nWhatever allocation we don’t spend, at the end of the year we will return to the DAO for further use.\n\n## Steps to implement\nWithin the next year, the Cyfrin team commits to:\n\n1. Technical implementation of creating the Allocation Committee’s multisig and define its members\n2. Allocation Committee details eligibility requirements and allocation criteria\n3. Define and implement process for protocols to apply for audits alongside the Allocation Committee\n4. Review applications and start distributing funds strategically for protocols who meet the criteria\n5. Pair auditors with protocols\n6. Kick-off auditing process\n7. Amplify the Security Enhancement Fund as a great reason for projects to choose Arbitrum as their L2 of choice, as well as promotion of the protocols Cyfrin audits\n8. Final report to protocols\n\n– Keep in mind, this process may vary depending on whether the protocol is undergoing a private, competitive or multi-phase audit.\n\n## Team\nPatrick Collins: Cyfrin’s CEO and former Lead of Chainlink DevRel, Patrick revolutionized the industry onboarding hundreds of thousands of developers into web3 with its courses and speeches, with more than 3 million views on his courses and ~160.000 subscribers across platforms.\n\nAlex Roan: Cyfrin’s CTO, Alex is a veteran Web3 developer who has contributed to core DeFi infrastructure such as Chainlink and Compound - securing billions of dollars in value.\n\nHans Friese: Cyfrin Lead Auditor and Co-founder, Hans is one of the world’s top auditors, consistently ranking at the top within competitive auditor leaderboards 2. He is also the founder and Lead Engineer of Solodit, the most used vulnerability aggregator tool for auditors.\n\nDon Dodge: tech veteran with a past in Google, Microsoft, Groove, Napster, AltaVista, and more. Startup investor, advisor, and board member.\n\nMark Scrine: previously the Strategic Lead for Proof of Reserve at Chainlink Labs and led a number of their biggest integrations. These included protocols such as TUSD, Matrix Port, Avalanche Bridge, BackedFi, and Swell Network.\n\nDeveloper Relations & Marketing: Our industry leading DevRel team will work together with the Arbitrum’s community to promote, educate, and onboard auditors into the Cyfrin ecosystem, advocating for audit quality for protocols. Additionally, through Cyfrin’s Education platform, our DevRel team is brewing the next generation of software engineers into the space with Arbitrum as their L2 of choice. Composed of 6 people total, here’s an example of some of the leaders in our team:\n\nVitto Rivabella, formerly leading Developers Experience at Alchemy, the popular Web3 infrastructure provider, and Alchemy University, educating tens of thousands of Web3 developers. Web3 educator, investor, developer, public speaker and a former VFX supervisor.\n\nJuliette Chevalier, former Lead of Developer Relations at Aragon and Co-founder of Surge Women, an organization bridging the educational gap between women and crypto products. She is also a key contributor to various DAOs, angel investor, software engineer, and public speaker.\n\nCommunity Manager: Our Community Manager will foster peer-to-peer relationships and manage technical support for the students going through the Arbitrum courses - a vital resource for community members seeking assistance and supporting CodeHawks auditors to do their best work.\n\nDesign: Our design team will create visually engaging and user-friendly materials, enhancing the overall learning experience for the Abitrum developer community and CodeHawks auditors.\n\nCodeHawks Team: The CodeHawks team together with Cyfrin will run, promote, judge, support and moderate the competitions and the community, onboarding and assisting the protocols looking to onboard on Arbitrum. Once the team has made sure the protocol respects the eligibility criteria, they will manage the entire cycle from start to finish. This includes sales (answering to active inbounds, and protocols suggested by the community), contest details, marketing, judging, and final report submission.\n\nAudit Team: Our team of security researchers are experts across a variety of fields like DeFi, oracles, Web3 social, and more. They come from the industry’s top auditor leaderboard and are dedicated entirely to the private audits.\n\n## Cost\nThe budget for this proposition totals $2 million.\n\nThe entirety of the funds is dedicated towards the sponsoring of audits for protocols deployed or deploying on Arbitrum.\n\nThe entirety of the funds will be expected upon proposal approval to maintain a rapid response to audit requests and safeguard protocol integrity.\n\nUpon the onchain approval of the proposal, these funds will be transferred to the Allocation Committee’s multi-sig, as set up by Cyfrin containing the 2 Cyfrin Committee representatives. The multi-sig’s first transaction will then add the 3 Arbitrum representatives before transferring any funds to protocols.\n\nAdditionally, Cyfrin suggests the Allocation Committee reimburses the DAO quarterly in the event that the minimum expected capital for that quarter ($500,000) isn’t spent within that time period. This will also enable a tangible oversight mechanism for the DAO to ensure Cyfrin is doing the expected work.\n\n## Why $2M?\n\nAt an average cost of $60,000, sponsored at 60%, $2M would cover anywhere from 20-25 audits in the span of a year.\n\nAlthough the cost of an audit varies widely based on codebase size, complexity, and audit type, audit prices typically range between $30,000-$100,000, with an average audit being ~$60,000.\n\nAssuming the Fund covers 60% of the audit, $2M are estimated to cover anywhere from 20-25 audits within the span of a year. Additionally, 70% of the fund will be used to cover existing protocols on Abitrum, with the remaining 30% used to cover new protocols launching on the chain.\n\n– Important to note that in order to have the best possible security for a protocol, projects often go through 2 or more audits - including private and competitive audits. Particularly for complex projects already holding a high TVL, a multi-phase audit is highly advised to decrease the chances of an exploit to an absolute minimum.\n\nConsidering Arbitrum is believed to have 1.2M total commits and over 1,100 Arbitrum repositories, with over 450 active developers, this fund would cover ~10% of Arbitrum’s development.\n\n https://www.developerreport.com/ecosystems/arbitrum\n\n## Framework on payments, reporting, and oversight\n\nCyfrin pledges to publish financial reports to the DAO to uphold transparency and accountability every quarter, outlining expenditure details, audits funded, decisions made, and progress updates. These reports will be posted in the Arbitrum DAO’s forum for the DAO to periodically review.\n\nSnapshot has a maximum character limit.
