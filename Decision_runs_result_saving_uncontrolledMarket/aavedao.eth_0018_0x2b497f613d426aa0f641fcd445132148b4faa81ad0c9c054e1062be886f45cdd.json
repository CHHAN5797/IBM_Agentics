The ACI proposes the extension of Orbit for a new quarter, Q1 2025, from 2024-12-14 to 2025-03-31.\n\nFrom now on, all renews will be applied strictly by Quarters, and a new cutoff has been set on [AIP 224](https://vote.onaave.com/proposal/?proposalId=224&ipfsHash=0xa4da1c686491e35541aa7e2659d55d0b93e395a89d1b268981aec3b8b2227bc1), to apply again previous rules of a minimum of 20k voting power and 85% vote ratio on all Snapshots and AIP to be considered elegible to Orbit.\n\n## Specification\n\n- **Period Coverage:** Q1 2025 from December 14th 2024 to March 31st 2025\n- **Eligible Platforms:**\n    - EzR3al: [0x8659d0bb123da6d16d9394c7838ba286c2207d0e](https://etherscan.io/address/0x8659d0bb123da6d16d9394c7838ba286c2207d0e)\n    - areta: [0x8b37a5af68d315cf5a64097d96621f64b5502a22](https://etherscan.io/address/0x8b37a5af68d315cf5a64097d96621f64b5502a22)\n    - stablelabs: [0xecc2a9240268bc7a26386ecb49e1befca2706ac9](https://etherscan.io/address/0xecc2a9240268bc7a26386ecb49e1befca2706ac9)\n    - IgnasDefi: [0x3DDC7d25c7a1dc381443e491Bbf1Caa8928A05B0](https://etherscan.io/address/0x3DDC7d25c7a1dc381443e491Bbf1Caa8928A05B0)\n- **Budget:** 60,000 GHO (aEthLidoGHO)\n    - 15k total budget per platform\n    - 15000 aGHO stream through 80 days\n\n- **Relevant Links:**\n    - [ACI’s Orbit tracker](https://dapps.aavechan.com/orbit-tracker)\n\n**Additional considerations:**\n\nAs a reminder, Service Providers will not be considered elegible to Orbit Program.\n\nA new vote rate cutoff will apply, starting next Orbit Renewal, where a minimum of 20k voting power and 85% vote ratio on all Snapshots and AIP will be considered in order to be elegible to Orbit Program, from [AIP 224](https://vote.onaave.com/proposal/?proposalId=224&ipfsHash=0xa4da1c686491e35541aa7e2659d55d0b93e395a89d1b268981aec3b8b2227bc1).\n\nFunds are distributed based on 90 days, as seen on budget.\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. Gather community feedback on this ARFC.\n2. If consensus is achieved, escalate this proposal to the ARFC snapshot stage.\n3.

This compensation allows them to focus on aave and keep their contribution efforts to our governance. The ACI proposes the extension of Orbit for a new quarter, Q3 2024, from 2024-05-13 to 2024-08-30.\n\n**Gas Rebate**:\n\nInitially meant to reimburse gas cost associated with governance voting, the gas rebate has been entirely focused on service provider gas reimbursement since the launch of Aave governance V3, we propose to segregate these payments after this proposal to keep focus and consistency in the Orbit program.\n\nGas reimbursements from service providers activity are proposed to be managed by Aave Finance service providers in their monthly treasury management update.\n\n## Specification\n\n**Period Coverage: Blocks 19860032 (May 13th 2024) to Block 20639896 (August 30th 2024)**\n\nEligible Platforms:\nEzR3al\nStableNode\nSaucy Block\nAreta\n\nGas Rebate: Last service provider gas rebate using orbit:\nACI : 2.91 ETH\nCatapulta: 0.67 ETH\nTokenLogic: 0.72 ETH\nBudget: 60000 GHO and 4.3 ETH\n\n## Relevant Links\n\n[Script output](https://aavechan.notion.site/Gov-V3-August-2024-script-Output-55c7ee78d48a4126a295f74a0dbf883c)\n[ACI’s Orbit tracker](https://dapps.aavechan.com/orbit-tracker)\n\n## Next Steps\nGather community feedback on this ARFC.\nIf consensus is achieved, escalate this proposal to the ARFC snapshot stage.\nIf the ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, proceed to the AIP stage for implementation and funding allocation in cooperation with Aave Finance service providers via an ad-hoc AIP vote or bundled in one of their treasury management AIPs.\n\n## Disclosure\n\nThe Aave Chan Initiative is independent and has not received any form of compensation from related parties for the drafting of this proposal.\n\n## Copyright\nCopyright and related rights waived under [Creative Commons Zero (CC0)](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)",

Compensating them with GHO and ETH reimbursement of Gas costs associated with their governance activity.\n\n## Motivation\n\nWith the transition to Governance V3, a significant feature introduced is gasless voting via Gelato integration on the [DAO-run governance app](https://vote.onaave.com), making it easier for delegates to participate without the burden of gas costs.\n\nThis innovation prompts the proposal to discontinue the general gas rebate program, However, recognizing the continued necessity for proposal creation and payload deployment activities, the proposal suggests maintaining targeted gas rebates for these specific actions. These tasks are now streamlined under the ACI's Dolce Vita product, offering a focused and efficient mechanism to manage and reimburse the gas expenditures associated with governance contributions.\n\nTo accurately track and reimburse gas expenditures, the proposal leverages [open-source scripts](https://github.com/JosepBove/aave-gov-gas) initially developed by Josep Bove, now part of the ACI team. These scripts have been [adapted for compatibility with Governance V3](https://github.com/AaveChan/aave-gov3-gas/tree/master), ensuring transparency and accountability in monitoring gas costs incurred by delegates during their governance activities.\n\nMoreover, the proposal introduces the [Orbit Tracker app](https://www.aavechan.com/orbit-tracker), which was developed by Martin, a new front-end engineer at ACI. This tool provides a comprehensive overview of recognized delegates, detailing their voting power and participation rates, thus enhancing the visibility of delegate contributions and engagement within the Aave ecosystem.\n\n \n![image](ipfs://bafybeidaq56t2akvacel6xwg6kasz3ktw3f7lck3ysvn7xodfxbpnp5wju)\n    \n\nThe eligibility criteria for Orbit renewal emphasize participation rate, power, and platform maturity, ensuring that only the most dedicated and impactful delegates are compensated. These criteria are designed to balance the quality of governance participation with the cost-effectiveness of the Orbit program.\n\nTo define eligibility for renewal of Orbit, we propose the following requirements:\n\n- Not an Aave Service Provider\n- Minimum 20k voting power\n- Minimum 70% participation rate\n- Minimum 120 days since delegate platform creation\n\nThe following table outlines the proposed compensation for eligible delegates matching the requirements:\n\n|Delegate Platform|Retro-Payment (GHO)|New Stream (GHO)|Total Cost (GHO)|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|EzR3al|5000|15000|20000|\n|Stable Labs|5000|15000|20000|\n|LBS Blockchain|5000|15000|20000|\n|Michigan|5000|15000|20000|\n|Total|20000|60000|80000|\n\nIn terms of gas rebate, we included Gov V2 reimbursement & payload-related activity in the following table:\n\n|Delegate / Service Provider | Gas Used (ETH)|\n|--- | ---|\n|ACI | 3.365|\n|Tokenlogic | 0.586|\n|Michigan | 0.276|\n|Wintermute | 0.2518|\n|LBS | 0.031|\n|StableLabs | 0.0342|\n|ezr3al | 0.3833|\n|**Total** | **4.9273**|\n\n### Relevant Links\n\n - [Orbit tracker app](https://www.aavechan.com/orbit-tracker) \n - Gov V2 [script output](https://aavechan.notion.site/Gov-V2-Gas-rebate-Feb-2024-Script-output-e7df604934434435849f71b4105a9d43?pvs=4)\n- Gov V3 [script output](https://www.notion.so/aavechan/Gov-V3-Payload-Script-output-cee4e7ce8b7048b58ec874a4b1499aa3)\n- Gov V2 [script code](https://github.com/JosepBove/aave-gov-gas)\n- Gov V3 [script code](https://github.com/AaveChan/aave-gov3-gas/tree/master)\n\n\n\n\n## Specification\n\n- **Period Coverage:** Blocks 18040579 (Sep 1st 2023) to 19162696 (5th feb 2024)\n- **Eligibility Criteria:** Non-Aave Service Providers, minimum 20k voting power, 70% participation rate, and 120 days since platform creation.\n- **Budget:** 80000 GHO and 4.6755 ETH\n\n## Next Steps\n1. Gather community feedback on this ARFC.\n2. If consensus is achieved, move this proposal to the ARFC snapshot stage.\n3. If the ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, proceed to the AIP stage for implementation and funding allocation in cooperation with Aave Finance service providers via an ad-hoc AIP vote or bundled in one of their treasury managements AIPs.\n\n## Disclosure\nThe Aave Chan Initiative is independent and has not received any form of compensation from related parties for the drafting of this proposal.\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived under [Creative Commons Zero (CC0)](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",
