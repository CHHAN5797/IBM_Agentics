        "body": "Abstract:\nThis Arbitrum Improvement Proposal (AIP) is presented with the vision of further enhancing the Arbitrum ecosystem following the Short Term Incentive Program (STIP). Acknowledging the STIP’s instrumental role in the growth of the Arbitrum ecosystem, this proposal seeks to extend its positive impact by introducing a gas rebate and trading incentive program created by Rage Trade, a native perp aggregator on Arbitrum. Through this initiative, we aspire to not only complement the milestones achieved by the STIP but also to significantly increase the influx of new traders into the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\nMotivation:\nAs the Short Term Incentive Program (STIP) kicks off, it sets the stage for the Arbitrum ecosystem to experience amplified growth. The STIP is poised to play a pivotal role in promoting on-chain activities and reinforcing key protocols. However, there is plenty of opportunity to intensify user engagement and participation, especially when considering innovative platforms like Rage Trade.\n\nThis proposal is driven by the ambition to harness this potential, acting synergistically with the anticipated successes of the STIP. Through Rage Trade’s introduction of a gas rebate and trading incentive program, our objective is not just to elevate trading activity, but also to enhance the overall user experience, attracting and onboarding new traders to the ecosystem. This effort is geared towards empowering platforms that, in line with Arbitrum’s vision, are poised for growth but require additional support to maximize their contribution.\n\nRationale:\n\nThis proposal aligns with Arbitrum’s mission to foster a dynamic and engaged community. By allocating 100% of the grant funds to create a gas rebate and trading incentives program, Rage Trade’s platform aims to refine the user experience of traders while offering gas savings and trading incentives to stimulate a competitive yet cooperative environment.\n\nSpecifications: A detailed breakdown of the platforms and technologies that will be used.\nRage Trade Platform:\n\nAs a prime broker and perpetual aggregator, Rage Trade unifies top decentralized perpetual exchanges across all EVM-compatible chains. It streamlines the trading experience by eliminating complexities associated with collateral and gas fund management, ensuring a faster, more efficient, and user-friendly environment for traders.\n\nGas Tank Mechanism:\n\nThe Gas Tank is a unique feature of Rage Trade that simplifies trading across different chains. Users deposit funds into their account, and a portion goes into the Gas Tank. This fund is then used to cover gas fees across various chains, eliminating the need for users to manage gas fees separately.\n\nSession-Based Trading System:\n\nRage Trade employs a session-based trading system where users create a session that lasts for a specified duration (e.g., 7 days). This system reduces the need for manual transaction signing, making the trading experience smoother and more akin to centralized exchanges.\n\nMulti-Leg Trading and Auto-Populating Bridge:\n\nThe platform allows users to create multiple trades from different chains and perps on Arbitrum, enabling them to spread risk and optimize execution. Additionally, Rage Trade handles all the bridging details, automatically selecting the best bridge or swap routes for seamless trade execution.\n\nCustom Route Selection:\n\nUsers have the option to split their orders based on various criteria such as best execution price, lowest funding fees, or routes with bonuses like emissions or airdrops. This feature provides flexibility and optimization for trade execution.\n\nAggregated Referral & Competitions:\n\nRage Trade aggregates referrals and competitions across different perp protocols, allowing users to participate in various trading competitions and referral programs through a single platform.\n\nIncentive Distribution:\n\nThe proposal involves the distribution of 1.5 million ARB tokens to incentivize trading volume on Rage Trade. The distribution will be structured to reward active traders and participants in trading competitions, fostering increased engagement and liquidity on the platform.\n\nTrading Competitions:\n\nA series of trading competitions will be organized, with ARB tokens allocated as prizes. These competitions aim to attract traders, boost trading volume, and create a vibrant trading community on Rage Trade.\n\nUser Engagement and Performance Metrics:\nRage Trade has successfully cultivated a dynamic user base, boasting 70,000 active traders who regularly engage with our platform. This robust participation is a testament to our platform’s appeal and functionality within the trading community.\n\nIn addition to our active traders, we have nurtured a strong Liquidity Provider (LP) community, with 26,000 LPs contributing to our ecosystem. This substantial number of LPs underscores our platform’s reliability and the trust placed in us by those who provide liquidity, further cementing our role as a pivotal player in the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\nOverall, our protocol’s historical performance not only demonstrates significant growth and adoption but also highlights our consistent delivery of value to our users, traders, and liquidity providers. These metrics are indicative of our integral position within the Arbitrum ecosystem and our potential to further enhance and expand our offerings with sustained support.\n\nRage’s Perpetual Performance:\n\nRage Trade v1 has experienced a remarkable market reception, evidenced by a staggering $735M in Total Trading Volume against Rage’s Total Value Locked (TVL). This impressive figure reflects the high demand and active engagement within our user base, showcasing the platform’s appeal and effectiveness.\n\n\n\n962×642 21.9 KB\nRage’s Vaults Performance:\n\nOur vault offerings, including the 80-20 Tricrypto Vault and GLP Vault, have achieved a notable peak TVL of approximately $19.87 million (at 100% max capacity since launch). This achievement highlights the trust and confidence users place in our vault products.\n\nAt its peak, Rage Trade accounted for about 1.4% of the entire Arbitrum TVL, marking our significant contribution to the overall ecosystem. This percentage represents our substantial impact and the value we add to the broader Arbitrum community.\n\nThe 80-20 Tricrypto vault, in particular, has demonstrated exceptional performance. Over its 10-month lifespan, it outperformed holding GLP by 8%. Specifically, from July 2022 to April 2023, the 80-20 Tricrypto vault yielded a 44% return compared to a 36% return from merely holding GLP, showcasing its effectiveness and profitability.\n\nSteps to Implement: The steps to implement the AIP, including associated costs, manpower, and other resources for each step where applicable. For the avoidance of doubt, any AIPs involving transactions with third parties (such as grants) will need to ensure that applicable legal documentation and procedures are also included.\nTo implement this proposal, we will follow a structured approach, ensuring each phase contributes effectively to the overall goal. Here’s how we plan to proceed:\n\nData Reporting and Transparency: Rage Trade is committed to transparency and will implement Dune dashboards for real-time tracking of all relevant metrics. These dashboards will ensure community members have access to up-to-date data, reflecting our progress and adherence to the commitments outlined in this proposal. This approach emphasizes our dedication to transparency and accountability within the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\nIncentive Allocation: We will begin by using a portion of the ARB tokens for our gas rebate program to offset gas fees for our users. This will serve as the initial spark to ignite trading activities on the Rage Trade platform.\n\nFee Offset & Trading Competitions: We will then allocate the remaining tokens to incentivize trading, including trade competitions and offsetting fees implemented by integrated perp protocols. The trading competitions will be strategically scheduled over time to ensure ongoing participation and interest.\n\nRegular Updates and Reporting: Throughout the implementation, we will continuously monitor platform performance, trader engagement, and community feedback. This will allow us to make real-time adjustments and improvements where necessary. To maintain transparency, we will provide the community with regular updates and reports. These will include key performance metrics and insights gained from the implementation process.\n\nReview and Analysis: At the end of the implementation phase, we will conduct a thorough review. This will involve analyzing successes, identifying areas for improvement, and extracting key learnings for future initiatives.\n\nBy following these steps, we aim to ensure not just the successful implementation of the proposal but also to contribute valuable insights for the continuous growth and development of the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\nTimeline: Relevant timing details, including but not limited to start date, milestones, and completion dates.\nThe implementation of this proposal is structured into a 4-month period, with each month focusing on specific objectives and milestones:\n\nMonth 1 - Initiation and Setup (Immediately upon approval):\n\nAllocation of ARB tokens to the designated multisig wallet to immediately initiate gas rebates and trading fee offsets. Setup of the Dune dashboard for tracking key metrics such as trading volume and unique traders. Announcement of the initiative and upcoming trading competitions to the community.\n\nMonth 2 - Launch of Trading Competitions:\n\nOfficial launch of the first set of trading competitions.\n\nActive monitoring of trading activities and engagement levels.\n\nFirst monthly update provided to the community, highlighting early results and trader participation.\n\nMonth 3 - Mid-term Review and Adjustments:\n\nComprehensive review of the first two months, analyzing trader engagement and competition outcomes.\n\nAdjustments made to competitions and incentives based on feedback and data analysis.\n\nSecond monthly update provided, including insights and any changes implemented.\n\nMonth 4 - Final Push and Comprehensive Analysis:\n\nContinued incentivization and promotion of trading activities.\n\nFinal monthly update provided, leading up to the comprehensive quarterly report.\n\nPreparation of the detailed analysis report, evaluating the proposal’s success based on predefined objectives.\n\nPost-4-Month Period - Evaluation and Reporting:\n\nRelease of a comprehensive quarterly report, detailing the overall impact of the proposal on trading volume, trader engagement, and growth within the Arbitrum ecosystem. Evaluation of the initiative’s success and consideration of potential future actions based on the outcomes.\n\nThis timeline ensures a structured approach to implementing the proposal, with regular updates and transparency. It allows for adjustments based on real-time data and community feedback, ensuring the initiative remains aligned with its goal of driving growth within the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\nKey Performance Indicators (KPIs):\n\nTo measure the success of achieving the grant objectives, we will focus on the following Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):\n\nDaily Volume: Aiming for a 30-day moving average of $10M in daily volume.\nDaily Traders: Targeting a 30-day moving average of 300 unique traders.\nIntegration: Committing to integrate 1 or more perpetual DEXes per 2 weeks (accounting for audit time).\nThese KPIs will serve as benchmarks to gauge our progress and effectiveness in utilizing the grant to drive growth and engagement within the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\nGrant Breakdown:\nRage Trade aims to leverage the grant to attract a substantial influx of users to the Arbitrum ecosystem, bolstering user interaction, transaction volume, TVL, and overall activity.\n\nStrategically, Rage Trade will allocate ~ 33% of the grant to gas rebates, with the other ~ 66% of the grant being directed towards offsetting integrated perp protocols’ trading fees and various trading competitions. The endgame is to amplify user onboarding and trading enthusiasm, resonating with genuine market dynamics.\n\nIt’s crucial to clarify that rebate rates will be determined by the genuine fees incurred by users. If our partnering protocols grant separate rebates or rewards, Rage Trade commits to ensuring that the total sum of rebates will never surpass the fees accrued. Throughout this promotional phase, trade-to-earn schemes will not be entertained. Additionally, the Rage Trade team will vigilantly deter and counteract wash trading and Sybil-attack incidents. Offending addresses linked with such activities will be publicly disclosed and denied the associated rebates.\n\nGas Rebates Explained:\nOnce a week, traders will receive ARB tokens as a gas rebate, mirroring the gas fees they’ve incurred throughout the week. This rebate system ensures that users can trade more freely, knowing a portion of their gas fees will be returned. The gas rebate will be uniformly applied across all protocols integrated with Rage Trade on Arbitrum, ensuring fairness and consistency for all traders. The rebate amount a trader receives will be directly proportional to the actual gas fees they’ve paid, eliminating any potential for manipulative practices like trade-to-earn schemes.\n\nFee Rebates Explained:\n\nARB tokens will be rewarded as fee rebates to our traders every Friday, reflecting the fees they’ve accumulated over the week.\n\nThis fee waiver will be consistently applied across all collaborating protocols.\n\nTraders’ rebate entitlements will strictly correlate with their actual trading fees, nullifying the chance for trade-to-earn practices. The rate of expenditure from the grant will be contingent on the volume of organic trading transpiring each week. The Rage Trade team pledges to continually identify and thwart wash trading and sybil-attack attempts.\n\nTo safeguard the integrity of the campaign, the specifics of the anti-wash-trading & anti-sybil-attack measures will be kept confidential and will be communicated post-event, mirroring best practices employed in protocol airdrop launches.\n\nExample of Fee Structure Post-Reduction:\n\nIf additional perps trading mechanisms in the Arbitrum realm are incorporated with Rage Trade amidst this campaign, the fee waiver will extend to those as well.\n\nIntegrated protocol trading fee rates before and after reduction\n\nGMX V1: 0.1% → 0%\n\nGMX V2: 0.05% / 0.07% → 0%\n\nOverall Cost: The total cost to implement the AIP.\nThe total cost to implement this AIP for Rage Trade is 1.5M ARB tokens. This cost is solely dedicated to funding trading competitions and volume incentives on the Rage Trade platform. The breakdown is as follows:\n\nGas Rebates: 500k ARB tokens will be allocated for offsetting gas fees when trading perps on Arbitrum.\n\nTrading Fee Rebates & Competitions: The remaining 1m ARB will be used as trading fee offsets and trading competitions.\n\nThere are no additional costs involved in this proposal. The entire 1.5M ARB token request is focused on directly incentivizing users and enhancing their trading experience on Rage Trade.",

        "body": "Synthetix is re-submitting our LTIPP proposal with the support of @coinflip from GMX. (He will post soon, but just sharing here for clarity to all)\n\nWe have reduced our ask to 2m ARB and made other core changes to the Proposal to align with council and delegate feedback.\n\n* Synthetix LTIP Proposal:[ https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/synthetix-ltipp-application-final/22023](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/synthetix-ltipp-application-final/22023)\n\nWe want to highlight that while our advisors provided valuable guidance, there was a discrepancy between the advisor and LTIP councilor feedback. Had we received the council feedback earlier, we would have promptly made the necessary adjustments to align with the council’s expectations.\n\nBecause of this discrepancy, we feel it is essential for delegates to reconsider the Synthetix LTIP proposal with the following edits:\n\n**Summary of feedback from Councillors/Delegates:**\n\n**1. Grant Size:**\n\n* The requested grant size of 4.5 million ARB is notably large, and it may take a long time for Arbitrum to recoup the benefit.\n* The grant size could potentially crowd out other grants to projects with fewer resources than Synthetix.\n\n**2. Incentive Design and Justification:**\n\n* More details are needed on the proposed trading competition and its contribution to the sybil resistance/wash trading score.\n* The Proposal lacks clarity in justifying the requested grant size and outlining a comprehensive risk assessment and mitigation strategy.\n* The Proposal would benefit from more concrete evidence and data supporting the expected impact on trading activity, liquidity, and user adoption within the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\n**3. Long-term Alignment with Arbitrum:**\n\n* Given Synthetix’s planned chain as part of the OP Superchain, there is a risk that the Proposal may, in the long term, draw users/liquidity/etc. outside of Arbitrum and be detrimental to the broader Arbitrum market.\n\n**4. Collaboration and Ecosystem Integration:**\n\n* More detail is desired on the proposed candidates for collaboration partnerships with other Arbitrum proposals.\n\n**TLDR Changes**\n\n* Total grant request reduced from 4,500,000 ARB to 2,000,000 ARB\n* Grant breakdown updated:\n  * 1,000,000 ARB for LP incentives (reduced from 1,600,000 ARB)\n  * 900,000 ARB for trading fee rebates (reduced from 1,800,000 ARB)\n  * 100,000 ARB for stablecoin liquidity (reduced from 500,000 ARB)\n  * Removed 600,000 ARB allocation for trading competitions and growth experiments\n* Incentives distribution timeline updated:\n  * LP incentives will be utilized throughout the entire three months, with an initial ramp-up period during the first month, to ensure there is proper liquidity to support open interest once Perps trading scales up.\n  * Stablecoin liquidity incentives & trading/growth incentives will be the focus of the second and third months\n* Milestones updated (scaled down due to reductions in grant sizing):\n  * Week 1-4: Reach 30m in LP collateral\n  * Week 4-8: Reach 5m in stablecoin liquidity\n  * Week 8-16: Achieve 5b in cumulative trading volume\n\n**Detailed Responses to feedback and Changes:**\n\n1. Grant Size and Allocation:\n\n* We have reduced the total grant request from 4.5 million ARB to 2 million ARB to better align with the LTIP Council & Delegate Feedback. This better aligns our proposal with the sizing in LTIP, and will provide valuable incentives to scale up Synthetix on Arbitrum.\n\n2. The revised grant breakdown is as follows:\n\n* 1,000,000 ARB for LP incentives\n* 900,000 ARB for trading fee rebates\n* 100,000 ARB for stablecoin liquidity\n\n2. Justification for Grant Allocation:\n\n**1. 1,000,000 ARB for LP Incentives:**\n\n* This allocation will enable us to achieve a critical mass of LP collateral, supporting the following collateral growth over a 3-month period (excluding trading fee rewards) - We’ve added this information from the request of the CounciCouncil * 20% APY: $27.3 million TVL\n  * 15% APY: $36.4 million TVL\n  * 10% APY: $54.5 million TVL\n  * 5% APY: $109.1 million TVL\n* A critical mass of LP collateral is essential to underwrite Perps Markets. Each $1 of liquidity provider capital allows Synthetix Perps to support $4 of major cryptocurrency open interest or $2 of longer-tail cryptocurrencies. This allocation will enable us to support approximately $70-100 million in OI caps, catering to whale traders and those transitioning from CEXs.\n\n**2. 900,000 ARB for Trading Fee Rebates:**\n\n* Capped at 75% of fees paid for users, this allocation serves two key purposes:\n  * Incentivize users to trade on Synthetix on Arbitrum for the first time, helping to market the product, onboard new traders, and ease them into our ecosystem.\n  * Incentivize LPs backing these markets, as they will receive a majority of the rewards.\n  * Based on the estimated fees rebated at 3-6bp and an ARB price of $1.10, the 900,000 ARB allocated for trading fee rebates translates to approximately $2.7-5.5 billion in fully rebated volume.\n\n**3. 100,000 ARB for sUSD Incentives:**\n\n* sUSD is a core component of our Proposal. Users can deposit LP collateral, delegate it to Perps V3 markets to underwrite trading and earn fees, and mint sUSD to pre-borrow against their trading fees. Ensuring deep liquidity for sUSD is critical to support this functionality and enhance capital efficiency.\n* At 10% APY, the 100,000 ARB allocation can support a liquidity pool size of approximately $6 million.\n* At 15% APY, the allocation can support a liquidity pool size of approximately $4 million.\n* At 20% APY, the allocation can support a liquidity pool size of approximately $3 million.\n\n3. Long-term Alignment with Arbitrum:\n\n* We understand the concerns regarding the potential impact of our planned OP Superchain on the Arbitrum ecosystem. Before anything else, we’d like to clarify that we see Arbitrum as a critical path of growth for Synthetix, and DeFi Derivatives as a whole. It has been the home of almost all onchain DEX Perps protocols, and we are excited to offer traders and LPs Synthetix V3 as another trading option. Additionally, we propose the following:\n* We will prioritize the growth and development of Synthetix on Arbitrum, focusing on driving users, liquidity, and activity to the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n  * It is also critical to note that the Synthetix deployment on Arbitrum is exclusive in its usage of an Arbitrum native stablecoin to increase system capital efficiency, support for additional assets outside of USDC (like Ethena sUSDe/USDe), and existing integrators ready to support this deployment.\n* We will work closely with the Arbitrum community and other projects to foster collaborations and integrations that benefit the entire ecosystem. There are ample opportunities for existing players, and due to the composable nature of Synthetix V3, we are excited to utilize these to increase the usage of Synthetix for Arbitrum native users.\n  * We’ve already passed a proposal with Ethena to support their stablecoin as collateral, and intend to onboard many more Arbitrum native assets as collateral types.\n* Clarify that Synthetix does not intend to bridge users to another chain through this program. We see a critical pathway to grow on Arbitrum as a home for DeFi Perps, and we intend to grow alongside the chain to grow onchain DEX Perps on Arbitrum.\n\n4. Collaboration and Ecosystem Integration:\n\n* We have identified several potential candidates for integration/asset support partnerships with projects on Arbitrum. These including existing ecosystem partners - Kwenta, Polynomial, Rage Trade, Infinex, and more.\n  * Additionally, at the asset level, Synthetix V3 can support any collateral type with an onchain oracle. Governance has already approved sUSDe/USDe as collateral on the platform and DAI/USDC/ETH/ARB.\n  * In the future, we intend to support yield-generating collateral types to increase the amount of composability, this will include (subject to governance) Lending Tokens (aave, comp, etc), sDAI from MakerDAO, LRT’s, LST’s, BTC on Arbitrum, and so on. We’ve listed this on our Proposal as well.\n\n5. Removed from the Proposal\n  * Trading Competitions/Growth Experiments - We’ve removed these from the Proposal due to council feedback.",

Camelot strives to support the native ecosystem through collaborative relationships and has a proven track record of allocating incentives to enable sustainable growth and long-term liquidity for ecosystem protocols. This proposal will therefore support deeper spot liquidity for Arbitrum native builders, as well as supporting integration partners and the launch of new protocols, thereby enabling significant growth through an approach that prioritizes Arbitrum’s core values. Most importantly, this will further the adoption of ARB as a base asset within liquidity pools and partner integrations.\n\n...\n\n## Motivation\n\nCamelot is not just a DEX - it’s the infrastructure that enables native protocols to build sustainable and efficient liquidity. As Arbitrum’s first major native DEX, Camelot strives to support the ecosystem with a long-term and collaborative approach that moves beyond the traditional role of DEXs as simple ‘yield farms’.\n\nIn just over 6 months of being live, Camelot has achieved over $2,500,000,000 total volume traded, highs of $100m TVL, and the successful onboarding of countless protocols to the Arbitrum ecosystem. The Round Table is the hub for Camelot’s official long-term partners, and the initial members consisted of the core Arbitrum protocols such as Vela, Jones, Pendle, Plutus, GMX, Sperax, and more. On average, Round Table partners have over 90% of their total DEX liquidity and volume on Camelot.\n\nSince then, the Round Table now consists of over 25 official partner protocols, and through its launchpad Camelot has supported over 9 protocols to raise funds in a community-focused and decentralized way. Most importantly, Camelot is home to numerous community builders that leverage the custom-built features to manage their liquidity, with a combined reach of over 40 native protocols present on Camelot and over 15 integrations being built on top of its infrastructure. Camelot is one of the most used dapps in the ecosystem, with over 300,000 unique users since launch. Camelot is not a fork, and is custom-built code that has been thoroughly tested and audited by Paladin. In addition, Camelot has no private investors and was launched in a truly community-focused and decentralized way. The ownership of Camelot has been spread through the key Arbitrum players, thereby making the protocol truly part of the ecosystem and community.\n\nThis grant would have a significant impact on the growth of the Arbitrum ecosystem in several ways:\n\n* Deep spot liquidity is the foundation for DeFi protocols to thrive, enabling further innovation and use cases for Arbitrum native protocols. For example, deeper spot liquidity unlocks the potential for tokens to be used in lending markets, options and perps protocols, structured products, and much more. Whilst other DEXs also tackle this for blue chip tokens, Camelot is uniquely positioned to most effectively support the native ecosystem builders. This proposal will specifically focus on Arbitrum protocols throughout their lifecycle, whilst leveraging the network and community of Camelot to generate sustainable growth with real users. Deepening pools that already have significant liquidity is not our only focus, as Camelot is positioned to ensure the distribution of ARB tokens materializes into a stronger ecosystem. Most importantly, Camelot can work with partners to pair their tokens with ARB as a base asset. This will advance ARB as a foundational asset of the ecosystem, providing it with direct value and utility.\n\n* Camelot has a proven track record of effectively allocating rewards in a sustainable and economical way. Therefore, not only will this grant proposal deepen liquidity, it will also ensure that the most active and aligned builders on Arbitrum directly benefit from it too. As an ecosystem hub for native builders, Camelot will leverage this grant to support and incentivise new protocols launching in the ecosystem, further cementing Arbitrum’s position as the go-to layer 2 for innovation and DeFi. Through its launchpad and network of Round Table partners, Camelot additionally offers protocols marketing, BD, and general support.\n\n* In addition to liquidity, Camelot is one of the largest Arbitrum governance delegates and has continued to foster collaboration in the ecosystem. Therefore, this proposal would also focus on integration partners that enable more efficient liquidity management and further use cases. These protocols also build on top of our partner liquidity pools, therefore multiplying the network effects of the allocated Arb incentives. Camelot currently has over 15 integration partners, ranging from advanced liquidity management apps, leveraged yield farming, derivatives, structured products, and more.\n\n...\n\n## Rationale\n\nCamelot was conceived to help deliver Arbitrum’s goal of scaling and revolutionizing the future of Ethereum. Through its commitment to supporting native builders, Camelot strives to build the foundation of sustainable liquidity and collaboration that will allow Arbitrum and its diverse ecosystem to thrive.\n\nSince its inception in December 2022, Camelot has maintained a robust upward trajectory, steered by a long-term, sustainable incentives approach. We've avoided the common pitfalls of being a ‘yield-farm for mercenary capital,’ and our proven track record of allocating incentives effectively to yield maximum returns for our community, protocol, and ecosystem stands testament to our potential. We plan to harness the power of Arbitrum grant incentives to maintain this growth trajectory.\n\nThough past performance doesn't necessarily predict future success, it does offer valuable insights into the potential of this proposal. Over the period from December 2022 to May 2023, Camelot experienced an impressive average monthly increase in volume and Total Value Locked (TVL) of 275% and 79% respectively. Even more noteworthy is that during this period, Camelot generated over $10m in protocol fees, with a significant proportion of these channelled back to our token holders. This strongly suggests that, with the additional Arbitrum incentives, we can stimulate significant growth and capture substantial long-term value across a large number of native protocols. Moreover, we can achieve this while ensuring a decentralized and sustainable token ownership distribution. Camelot also received an airdrop of over 2,000,000 ARB, which has so far been fully dedicated to being an active governance participant.\n\nTo allocate the Arbitrum incentives even more effectively we will distribute it across 4 different categories: Ecosystem Builders, Integration Partners, Core Pairs, and Liquid Staking Derivatives.\n\n![image](ipfs://bafkreicjatrrpsk2u22lkmiqwklpmnk5jqkacc45odyf7npqib3hrgydse)    \n\n### Ecosystem Builders\n\nCamelot is home to many of Arbitrum’s favourite protocols, and this category will distribute incentives to builders that are fully aligned with Camelot’s approach to sustainable liquidity and long-term collaboration. As detailed in the ‘Specifications’ section below, Camelot is one of the most effective hubs to distribute incentives, due to the large and expansive network of long-term partners.\n\n### Integration Partners\n\nBy providing incentives to partners that are building on top of Camelot’s infrastructure, we are diversifying the use of incentives to fuel even further innovation and growth that benefits all partners and the broader ecosystem, whilst also deepening the underlying liquidity at the same time. These partners would include concentrated liquidity managers, leveraged yield protocols, lending markets, liquidity management dapps and more.\n\n### Core pairs\n\nWhilst Camelot’s primary focus is on the native Arbitrum builders, ensuring Camelot can offer deep liquidity for the most actively traded tokens like ETH and USDC is also important as the native DEX. With the number of protocols actively building on Camelot, deep liquidity for core pairs will be an important piece to ensure we have a strong foundation that can expand to longer-tail tokens too.\n\n### Liquid staked derivatives\n\nLiquid staked derivatives are seeing rapid growth as they unlock significant liquidity on Ethereum whilst securing the network at the same time. The majority of LSD liquidity is currently on Ethereum, and we think it’s an important catalyst for the broader Arbitrum ecosystem to support LSD adoption natively too. Deeper LSD liquidity will allow Arbitrum native builders to tap into a highly productive asset to build on top of, leading to further growth, utility, and products for the ecosystem.\n\n### Velodrome on Optimism as Precedent\n\nWhile Arbitrum is a unique ecosystem which is difficult to compare to other networks, the effect of Optimism’s grant to Velodrome in July of 2022 supports that a similar grant to Camelot could have a positive effect on the Arbitrum ecosystem. Velodrome received a 3M OP grant from the Optimism Foundation in July of 2022 that was meant to last 4-5 months. As seen in the visual below, Velodrome had around $14M in TVL, generated around $3.3k in weekly fees, and had $2M in daily volume before the grant. In the last 3 months, Camelot has averaged over $80M in TVL, $450,000 in weekly fees, and $18M in daily volume. While TVL and volume numbers can be skewed by low fee-generating mercenary TVL, fees paid are less biased, and Camelot has been earning over 100x more fees than Velodrome before incentives.\n\n![image](ipfs://bafkreidwm2wtosajdmpiqyryhwv3wvbrr634fp2zavgebk5z7jjl6igwdu)    \n\nCamelot has surpassed Velodrome by nearly every metric by using novel, long-term emission incentives. Thus, we’re asking for 1.5M ARB per month vs Velodrome’s 3M OP over 4-5 months. Because Camelot is currently in a much better position than pre-grant Velodrome, we expect that the ARB grant will increase liquidity depth on Camelot and the general ecosystem expansion even more, supercharging the network to a new level.\n\nTo provide additional perspective, the Arbitrum DAO treasury currently holds 3,527,046,084 ARB tokens. Assuming a hypothetical 10-year runway of treasury spending, this would be equivalent to 352m ARB tokens a year. Camelot’s grant proposal for a total of 9m ARB tokens would therefore represent 2.56% of the annual budget, with the expectation of significant ecosystem growth and expansion.\n\n***Camelot TVL, Volume and Fees before ARB Grant***\n![image](ipfs://bafkreiflwh7et2aybm4bhk2aunxtlloz6h3yxtxdd4gffgawyhajcno4l4)\n\n...\n\n## Specifications\n\nCamelot will distribute 1,500,000 ARB tokens per month as incentives across a broad range of Arbitrum liquidity pools and integrations. The distribution of these incentives will adhere to the Proposal Objectives, the proposal parameters, and the Transparency Report. \n\nThe transparency report will ensure that Camelot has clearly documented where every $ARB token has been allocated, the relevant growth metrics achieved, and most importantly the progress for its broader Arbitrum objectives. You can see the objectives and parameters below and a template of the transparency report attached. This report will be provided at the latest 72 hrs before the following month’s incentives are to be distributed.\n\n### Proposal Objectives\n*(As measured and tracked within the transparency report, attached below)*\n\n* To grow the liquidity of Arbitrum builders, bringing new users into the ecosystem and directly supporting the growth of ecosystem protocols\n* To use the incentives to bring new protocols into the Arbitrum ecosystem\n* To support the launch of native builders and their liquidity requirements\n* To advance the adoption of ARB as a base asset in liquidity pools\n* To advance the adoption of ARB within integration partner strategies\n* To provide marketing and community support to the ecosystem builders included in the incentive programme\n\n### Proposal Parameters\n*(As measured and tracked within the transparency report, attached below)*\n\n* Incentives will be distributed to a minimum of 30 partner pools, as documented in the transparency report. Any new pool or integration needs to be clearly documented beforehand in the transparency report.\n* No single pool or partner (excluding core $ARB pools) can receive more than 5% of the total incentives (as measured over a 30-day period)\n* No single pool or integration partner can receive more than 5% of its TVL in monthly incentives (as measured over a 30-day period)\n* A pool must maintain a minimum trading volume of $1,000,000 annualized to be valid to receive rewards (as measured over a 30-day period).\n* A minimum of 33% of the total incentives will be used on liquidity pools with $ARB as the base asset. On top of this minimum, Camelot will provide bonus incentives to teams that actively transition their liquidity to ARB as a base asset too. This will be included and measured within the aforementioned transparency report.\n* The partner integration section has now been merged into the “Ecosystem Builders” section, with the relevant parameters above being applicable.\n* If at any point the Arbitrum community or DAO is not satisfied with the performance or delivery, they can move forward with a governance vote to end the grant early.\n\nCamelot will distribute the incentives across the following categories and pools detailed below. The distribution across these various pools will adhere to the Proposal Objectives and parameters, please reference the transparency report for a more in-depth breakdown:\n\n[TRANSPARENCY REPORT](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_os6yN7G2kdoeoXNotX0nqsYXQyJ0bakGXavmLNIXdc/edit?usp=sharing)\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreifbxdwctnf335rkwqpw7k5dejulbgc3wbcmjxew45pkxxttyamhrq)\n\n* Ecosystem Builders 75%\n  * Liquidity incentives for partner pools such as Vela, Pendle, Plutus, Jones and a diverse range of Arbitrum protocols. This will include integration partners that build on top of Camelot liquidity pools, such as Gamma and DeFi Edge, following the same parameters and guidelines shared above.\n  * The transparency report contains a broader breakdown of the ecosystem pools that this will be focused on. In addition, these incentives will be used to encourage the adoption of ARB as a base asset for ecosystem protocol liquidity pools.\n\n* Core Pairs 15%\n  * These represent the core liquidity pools such as ARB/ETH, ETH/USDC, and USDC/USDC. Further examples are included in the transparency report.\n\n* Liquid Staking Derivatives 10%\n  * Focusing on a diverse range of LSDs, most of which have little liquidity on Arbitrum. This will therefore target protocols such as unshETH, Lido, Rocket Pool, Swell, Stafi and more.\n\nCamelot will utilize its Nitro Pools technology to release the granted ARB in combination with $GRAIL and $xGRAIL emissions to liquidity providers. Nitro Pools are custom-built permissionless solutions to distribute incentives to any liquidity pool, with the ability to add custom requirements also. Along with the rest of the protocol, Nitro Pools have been audited by Paladin, and used by Camelot and numerous partners over the previous 8 months.\n\n\n...\n\n## Steps to implement\n\nCamelot will receive 1,5000,000 monthly over a period of 6 months, for a total of 9m ARB. In order to most transparently receive the tokens requested, Camelot will use a new multisig that will have several ecosystem players from other Arbitrum protocols. The makeup of this multisig, including the protocol affiliation(s) of each signer will be made public upon the creation of the multisig (before the proposal is moved to snapshot), and all changes to the makeup of the multisig will be announced in advance. This multisig will be governed by a multisig participation agreement wherein each signer will agree to use their signing authority only to further the interest of the wallet itself, using the ARB tokens to incentivise liquidity in approved nitro pools. By structuring the multi-sig with signers representative of the broader Arbitrum ecosystem, Camelot will ensure that the ARB tokens granted by the Arbitrum DAO will be leveraged to support new protocols, DAOs, and projects that are broadly value additive for Arbitrum.\n\nCamelot currently has [2,189,094 ARB tokens](https://debank.com/profile/0x03ff2d78afb69e0859ec6beb4cf107d3741e97ab) in its treasury, which it has used entirely for governance purposes. As an additional safeguard and sign of assurance, Camelot commits to placing its own ARB into the grant multisig for the duration of the 6 month proposal, therefore at any given time, Camelot will have “guaranteed” more ARB than it would receive from the Arbitrum DAO. Once the grant is over, Camelot will receive its own 2,189,094 ARB tokens back.\n\nOnce the ARB tokens have been distributed to the intended multisig wallet, Camelot will bear the full responsibility and workload to ensure the effective allocation of these tokens. Camelot will actively manage and continuously analyze the effectiveness of the incentives being used, following the aforementioned proposal objectives and parameters, and clearly documenting any changes or adjustments in the transparency report.\n\nMore information on the mechanics of Camelot’s nitro pools is available [here](https://docs.camelot.exchange/protocol/nitro-pools). Once the ARB tokens have been distributed to the grant multisig, Camelot will then further distribute them to internal wallets where the tokens will be used as incentives for the pools and partner integrations mentioned above under ‘Specifications’.\n\n* Camelot will receive 1,500,000 ARB tokens per month for 6 months, which it will distribute in accordance to the proposal objectives and parameters.\n* Camelot will detail how every ARB token is allocated and the progress towards the proposal objectives within the [transparency report](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_os6yN7G2kdoeoXNotX0nqsYXQyJ0bakGXavmLNIXdc/edit?usp=sharing).\n* The transparency report will be shared no later than 72 hours before the next month's incentives are distributed.\n* Camelot will hold a bi-weekly public community call to discuss the performance and progress of the grant and the transparency report in further detail.\n\n...\n\n## Timeline\n\nCamelot will begin the grant distribution from the date this proposal is passed and the ARB is delivered until 6 months after. The 1.5M ARB will be distributed monthly to the relevant ecosystem multisig mentioned above, for a total of 6 months.\n\nOnce the grant is active, Camelot will provide the subsequent transparency reports no later than 72 hours before the next month's incentives are to be distributed. The transparency report will follow the template that is attached and will include all relevant information. Following the conclusion of the grant, Camelot will provide a comprehensive analysis of the performance of the grant and its impact.\n\n...\n\n## Overall cost\n\n1,500,000 ARB distributed monthly over 6 months, for a total of 9M ARB tokens.",

Based on the insights received we have refined our proposal to better align with the council’s expectations.\n\nSummary of feedback received from the council:\n\n* Wintermute: Reservations regarding protocol’s adoption relative to the grant size\n* GFX: Rebate Incentive Bucket does not align with the DAO’s objectives\n* Karel: Suggested testing of rebate mechanism outside of the LTIPP, more details around upcoming social features and sybil/wash trading prevention. Recommends re-submitting the proposal with a reduced task demonstrating lower traction.\n\nThe original proposal can be found here:\n\nhttps://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/buffer-ltipp-application-final/21918/4?u=feyman101\n\nThe updated comments/changes per the council’s feedback can be found here:\n\nhttps://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/buffer-ltipp-application-final/21918/8?u=feyman101\n\n## Responses and Updates:\n\n* Reduced Grant Size\n\nWe have reduced the grant request to 56,624 ARB, a 74.8% reduction from the original ask of 224,735 ARB.\n\nGrant Breakdown:\n\n![|602x96](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/tMVSI8tWDNy6ys1j02NEO5NBMoeCCU4wzaQccZwR_IkkFeyzjTkMHmYV_9wYHrmnKEFt-wZ9w6dZ8J9YDMLXvy9q6rg5_yTB3Ou7_MPoh1f4pskDMv71rlfOy5ErQZDNFNsYYLTslbwBOocwcWUmqEc)\n\n* Eliminate the Trading Fee Rebate Component from the proposed Incentive Buckets\n\nAs advised by the council, we will test the trading fee rebate program outside of the LTIPP process. The new requested grant size of 70K ARB will be distributed across 3 incentive buckets:\n\n1. Grow Buffer Liquidity Pool (BLP) TVL via LP Yield Boost Vaults: 26,900 ARB\n\nJustification:\n\n![|602x115](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/3yGLkpRDiq6B4Xf6DyaKTPs1I5x68j3HO4PX7QQelbqBt9_ABg0RLDVU4mqhjTh-cp4YJsstnRGKvjDlkGvS7dpbRuHDrTZnQJ501HfpURQz2hXau-2QPTdKBLuEKf1b3UWy1uDCqi8dr-_odURzNFs)\n\nExecution:\n\nLPs lock liquidity into uBLP market-making pools to revive LP boost NFTs. These LP NFT will have yield-bearing properties. They can be locked for a period of time (2 days to 90 days) to increase % of LP rewards.\n\nEvery LP NFT will have its own unique spec like amount and lockup period. The yield boosting pools are the final destination where LPs can stake their LP positions (aka. LP NFTs) to receive ARB rewards.\n\nMilestone:\n\n![|602x83](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/ONdV5dMAWkCtEQsnaYRGiR380rvFSbva7ymZOlEdwZ0g6mVVx-JENlLoraSpGZrKvao1W4VzhxbHqAb-uu1YPgNlwb2oVS0Vv9ApKaBOA1SYg1JFbezK1rfM1QtDuML2gz846SAZxuD6NzDhyIAHAw8)\n\n2.

In each league, the daily ranking will recognize the top 30 traders with the highest absolute PnL and 10 traders with the lowest absolute PnL, awarding points based on their ranking.\n\nBased on the total accumulated points with each day’s weight, a weekly rank is derived. The allocation of the total ARB incentives is distributed based on the weight of the accumulated points.\n\nMilestone:\n\n![|602x100](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/sR_7phnGTgRSdMTbsSHiGl-AzxGC2LVUpjKEqSYeOGuQM_yEf4qLscZX0mby-Ggip60n9OjR4wQzVFC9-_pIb9FNYqEWWsek5sh6OCyXLZX5QHS8ne_1QZv0Eb_aF5mb7NS_rTQDQiGCBGuCByHuZMs)\n\n3. Randomized reinforcement to increase trading frequency per trader (Jackpots): 10,000 ARB\n\nThe user qualifies for the jackpot if the position size is equal to or exceeds the minimum trade size. As soon as the trade is placed, an additional random number is received from the vrf (if the user qualifies for a jackpot),based on the vrf value a fixed payout is made to the trader.\n\nDistribution:\n\n![|602x131](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/FUk1xG-QhKTpdZuSE4m7kSjAeXhZfGteXy1czIaxrzO52_Ts_Mx2gXqZ3-c-1aAt13P521JK4_kK3qWBZ5x4f3ed59AKpXOz1uKajDf_4O3VdGe7hybbbamENvAjixPE5X0IpseGarkHK-Z471qtMbU)\n\nMilestone:\n\n![|602x99](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/GlyOlMAw0pt-y-kOywOWsa_-wwapgvOprx4ijSk7xXvHSKx5xQKm42UA7ZaZLTSBghG49UmYftHv_wbu0DL91x12JqguQITjb0C_BW-2UD6CBpgpHk01dNE6_fRSEP7jU7y2gjpDxsZwjwiLFPKn9oc)\n\n* Addressing councils reservations around Protocol Performance:\n\nSince launching Buffer on Arbitrum in September 2022, the protocol has demonstrated significant market fit, initially generating an average of 5,000 USDC in fees daily. Buffer employs an AMM-based model similar to GMX, where the Buffer Liquidity Pool (BLP) facilitates market-making for exotic options trading. Buffer runs on a similar AMM based model as GMX - where the BLP (Buffer Liquidity Pool) provides market-making liquidity for exotic options trading.\n\nFollowing our September 2023 launch of Buffer v2.5, we implemented stringent risk management strategies—including tighter open interest caps and spreads—to maintain positive expectancy for the AMMs and safeguard LP interests (a trajectory similar to that of GMX and GMX v2). During this time, due to market fluctuations and competitor activities influenced our trading volume and performance, leading to weeks of lower averages post-launch.\n\nRecently, we initiated the Bull vs Bear Trading Competition, which, coupled with a relaxation of our conservative risk management policies, has reignited interest and activity within the protocol. Currently, the daily volume averages over 16,000 USDC.\n\n![|602x336](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/xm8sr2SroZFuymX2xfpEQOzgwuuWOB2Kwow8YMfyoqnCtRU99PUGUkogECU_tO_k80MAz6sQnwJNtqguEZ5iRO4j3M7lJ6Nv8w_6SDyXIbCluxxP5QHQX7inIxp3gFAjKw4am7AIkRssIAeZY3Li09Q)\n\nBull vs Bear Competition Summary (the campaign is still ongoing, we are 3 weeks into it):\n\n* Week 1\n\n![|602x121](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/W8ibCJeyFsz3XboMrNXn2Mob4CBU-9GjBOHx1tKi9sXa052xZS6UdsrzKo11Rlw0XN_YuOsqoKnHBuTQTtKnhDbZ6OSa9PtnojCMODhS5TrrbaA0UBkSgj6-2SbitXTo_7lmotBEb0nI9m_gBxLKY6o)\n\n* Week 2:\n\n![|602x115](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/jWI8M8tG1qEKmWDf-sntfQ8DD30WI5t8cKFOl9ev_B-c2ZKAPqKXAXFvWZV8KrVoW4a24QhC43AQEqOA2fzbdKgne0aZ78xiz8y84-HlOoXAxk3oDF5nqkMoChJ6kAxwkpEvMBDRjKZtUT8094CoFu4)\n\n* Week 3:\n\n![|602x123](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/qLx_VF4eKGaU80_LNfLNqOSO7izfe_ynltaTKvgid3cKajdqstaZLK8A36VlnczyMdJmVNCG1peLIaBmy3VPxwkURiYuN29sF5NYwmJYShvmwxUKJsg7BqNGbwtR5FT_IM1NtXph94aYDnmNvjiTeSo)\n\nAll competition related metrics can be found here:\n\nhttps://app.buffer.finance/#/leaderboard/galxe\n\nDashboard shows a significant uptick in trading volume as well as returning users: https://app.buffer.finance/#/dashboard || https://stats.buffer.finance/\n\n* Measures to prevent Wash Trading:\n\nBuffer’s League based competition makes gaming the system incredibly difficult. The competition is designed to reward consistent, ongoing performance instead of a single one-time score.\n\nPending rewards are accumulated based on rank on the leaderboard. Total rewards for each rank are calculated based on a geometric sequence - to ensure that each position on the leaderboard earns more than the place below it, rather than grouping leaderboard standings into equal reward buckets.\n\nTrading leagues will have a cap on incentives based on fees earned to prevent any wash trading – this is further prevented by being focused on PnL, although volume may play a factor.\n\n* Accountability and Implementation:\n\nOn top of our [Dashboard](https://app.buffer.finance/#/leaderboard/galxe?week=3) and [Stats](https://stats.buffer.finance/arbitrum) page, we set up Dune Dashboards for tracking metrics around the initiatives. We will commit to regular updates around the protocol performance, especially around metrics including:\n\n* BLP TVL\n* Trading Volume\n* Trading Fee Generated\n* User growth and retention\n* Effective prevention of wash trading around competitions.\n\n* Details on Social Features:\n\nAs the new incentive layer unfolds on Buffer, we will introduce several features to increase stickiness and drive trading activity:\n\n1. Revamped Optopi Collection: Optopi is a collection of 8,888 unique PFP friendly NFTs on Arbitrum offering key utilities to traders. We plan to revamp the Optopi utility to offer exclusive features including: exclusive access to trading leagues (higher tier in trading leagues), discounts while buying payout boosts.\n\n2. Chatting rooms: allowing users to engage directly with other users on the platform who are interested in that community or page.\n\n3. Trading Challenges: allowing traders to engage into battle royale-styled PvP challenges to facilitate user onboarding and community building.\n\n4. Low risk PVP trading: play tokens or virtual tokens that allow traders to trade risk free on Buffer.\n\n5. Social Trading: enable social trading, allowing users to follow and replicate top performing traders on Buffer.",

        "title": "Proposal: Build Optimal Onboarding for STIP Teams (BOOST)",
        "author": "0xA7860E99e3ce0752D1ac53b974E309fFf80277C6",
        "body": "Abstract\n\nThis Arbitrum Improvement Proposal (AIP) seeks to enhance user acquisition and engagement efficiency in the Arbitrum ecosystem following the Short Term Incentive Program (STIP). The proposal aims to deploy 95 total quests across 62 unique applications. The goal is to provide a comprehensive onboarding, educational, and interaction model that results in sustained user commitment and thus solidifies Arbitrum’s position as a leading Layer 2 Ethereum scaling solution.\n\nMotivation\n\nWe propose an innovative solution to address an opportunity that has surfaced following the execution of the Short Term Incentive Program (STIP) – the need for effectively onboarding, educating, and retaining new users on the Arbitrum platforms that received STIP. The STIP successfully provides incentive to perform onchain actions, but it does not address the user onboarding experience aspect of attracting new users. This proposal is viewed as the missing puzzle piece to STIP. In addition, the STIP had teams qualify, but not receive funding, providing a situation we aim to reconcile by running additional quests for those teams that will improve user retention and increase usage of their protocols.\n\nRationale\n\nOur proposal aligns meticulously with Arbitrum’s mission to foster an inclusive, vibrant, and engaged community. By ensuring all users - existing and new ones - are carried along inclusively and effectively via well-designed quests, we will be creating an environment that promotes continued learning, interaction, and commitment. This “sticky factor” is critical for a sustainable and thriving ecosystem.\n\nKey Terms\n\nWhat are Quests?\nQuests are guided learning activities, organized around specific crypto protocols and apps. They are designed to familiarize users with different protocols, their processes, and the potential benefits they offer within ecosystems like DeFi on Arbitrum.\n\nWhy are Quests Helpful?\n\nQuests provide a hands-on learning experience which makes the understanding of complex protocols more enjoyable and interactive. They provide delightful step-by-step guidance which motivates users to explore and use these protocols, thereby increasing user adoption and contributing to the broader understanding of apps.\n\nFor instance, consider the quest on Layer3 called “Exploring Radiant”. It guides users through learning about onmichain money markets, swapping, and depositing on Radiant, breaking down each step into comprehensible segments.\n\nBy engaging with the quest, users not only learn how to use the Radiant platform, but also get practical experience which they can apply in real-world situations. Quests like these play a crucial role in demystifying DeFi protocols, making them more accessible, and bringing users to Arbitrum.\n\nIn the case of Exploring Radiant, it managed to attract 31,181 completions. This demonstrates the high engagement rate and efficiency of quests as interactive learning tools in the DeFi space. The large number of participants signifies that the quest was not only successful in providing valuable insights about the protocol but also in garnering interest from a wider community, thereby increasing the adoption rate of the whole Radiant platform.\n\nBut it isn’t just Radiant.\n\nThere is a whole library of Arbitrum quests available on Layer3. As part of the STIP Enhancement and Inclusion Quest Proposal, a whole new category will be created on Layer3 to display the quests included in the STIP Enhancement and Inclusion Quest Program\n\nWhy Layer3?\nLayer3 has played a significant role in the growth of Arbitrum.\n\nWe’ve guided over 337,613 users to complete more than 5.9 million on-chain transactions on Arbitrum, all at no cost to the user or Arbitrum DAO. Our initiatives, particularly interactive quests, have already greatly increased user engagement and education on Arbitrum.\n\nBy transforming onchain operations into bite-sized, step-by-step quests, we have managed to make Arbitrum accessible to a wider audience. We have made it accessible and comprehensible to users, regardless of their technical proficiency level.\n\nSpecifications:\nTeams:\nUpon approval, we will embark on the design and execution of 95 quests structured strategically for the following protocols and teams in direct support of the STIP.\n\nThis includes one quest for each STIP-qualified protocol (29 projects, one quest each) and two quests for each recipient that received a greater than 50% majority in favor of their STIP proposal and more than 71.51 million ARB in support for their proposal (33 projects, two quests each). Each quest is meticulously designed to enhance user comprehension, interaction, and loyalty to the respective protocols.\n\nThe list of protocols and teams includes but is not limited to:\n\n1\tCamelot, Jones, Dopex, GMX, LODESTAR, Socket, Timeswap, RADIANT, Pendle Finance, MUX, Frax, Tally, Rysk, Silo Finance, Stella, Good Entry, Gamma, Umami, Abracadabra, KyberSwap, OpenOcean, Angle, Trader Joe, Dolomite, Premia, Vertex, Perennial Finance, Balancer, WINR\n\n2\tWOOFi, Gains Netowrk, DefiEdge, Synapse Protocol, PancakeSwap, Notional Finance, Rodeo, Magpie, Stargate, Savvy, Tales of Elleria, Thales, TIDE, Solv Protocol, Furucombo, dForce, Sanko GameCorp, RAMSES, Vela Exchange, Thetanuts, JOJO Exchange, Wormhole, Shell Protocol, REALM, unshETH, StakeDAO, Curve, iZUMi, Beefy Finance, Arrakis Finance, Florence Finance, CVI, Prime Protocol\n\nPayment Terms:\nThe compensation for this proposal will encompass a real-time, continuous flow of 1 million ARB tokens, streamed via the Superfluid protocol. The stream will commence immediately post-approval and will run continuously up until May 19, 2024.\n\nShould we fall short of fulfilling our obligations at any point within the specified period, a new proposal can be initiated to stop the stream of funds.\n\nIn the spirit of transparency, we commit to providing regular progress updates and upon completion of each of the 3 phases and maintaining Dune Analytics impact dashboards for the duration of the initiative, both at the application and ecosystem level. In a scenario where we fail to deliver our commitments, the community possesses the full right to propose halting the stream until the matter is adequately addressed and resolved.\n\nSteps to Implement\n\nInitiate a cooperative process with all STIP-qualified protocols to design a unique quest for each, and create two additional quests for the teams that met the criteria but weren’t granted STIP.\n\nImplement the quests in month-long phases, during which we will monitor user engagement, quest completion rates, and user feedback, among other indicators.\n\nImpact Analysis with Dune Dashboards: Post-sprint, we will analyze and present our impact utilizing detailed Dune dashboards. These dashboards will visually represent key metrics to paint a clear picture of the project’s success. Metrics categories include user engagement, unique user rates, and protocol specific metrics.\n\nBy confronting these steps, we can continuously refine our approach, ensuring that we provide mutually beneficial outcomes for both users and protocols involved in the STIP program.\n\nPhase 1 - STIP Proposal Quests (November 2023 - January 2024): Quests specifically designed for all STIP-qualified protocols will be released in six groups, each running for a month. The intention is to boost user engagement with these protocols that have received official STIP funding and guide users on how to use STIP protocols.\n\nPhase 2 - Non-STIP Proposal Quests 1 (February 2024 - April 2024): The second phase focuses on those teams that met the STIP criteria but did not receive funding. This stage ensures that these projects also get beneficial visibility and user engagement through their initial quests.\n\nPhase 3 - Non-STIP Proposal Quests 2 (March 2024 - May 2024): The final phase continues the support for non-STIP funded projects, further providing engagement through a second quest for each team. This step is designed to maintain and enhance user interest and interaction, consolidating the engagement prompted in Phase 2.\n\nRunning two quests for non-STIP funded projects (Phase 2 and 3) is particularly beneficial as it contributes to user retention through a deeper experience with the protocol.\n\nThe first quest provides users with initial exposure to the protocol, its functions, and utility. It attracts & onboards new users and raises their curiosity, while also providing a sense of familiarity and comfort with the protocol.\nThe second quest aims to solidify this relationship. A user returns to reinforce their understanding and re-engage with the protocol – a follow-up to further strengthen the interaction between the user and protocol.\nThe aim is to attract users and provide a solid foundation for them to be engaged, active and aligned with the protocol over a longer period. This ultimately contributes to the longevity and sustainability of each protocol.\n\nThis phased approach allows us to target attention to each group of protocols, ensuring each has optimized quests and yields the best possible results for all involved.\n\nOverall Cost Estimate:\nThe total cost to implement this AIP is 1M ARB where:\n\nRecurring costs will entail updates and maintenance, community engagement efforts, partnerships, performance tracking, and reporting.\n\nThis proposal lends to Arbitrum’s goal to build an engaged and knowledgeable community committed to the platform’s longevity. By incorporating all users in a guided and rewarding learning journey, we act as a funnel for new Arbitrum users, rather than current participants dominating rewards. By also acknowledging and rewarding the efforts of teams that did not qualify for STIP, we foster a fairer and more inclusive community spirit, further underlining Arbitrum’s commitment to its members.\n\nThis dynamic, transparent, and comprehensive approach propels the strength and sustainability of the Arbitrum community.",
