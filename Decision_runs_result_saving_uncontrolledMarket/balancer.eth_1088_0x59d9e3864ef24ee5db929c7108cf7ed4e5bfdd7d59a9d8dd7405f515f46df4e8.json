It's a chance to connect, collaborate, and spark innovation in a dynamic environment. These meet-ups foster strong relationships and provide a valuable platform for shaping the future of decentralized finance.\n\nThis edition is being planned to take place in the vibrant city of [Florianópolis, Brazil](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPTOltHI0IM), also known as *Island of Magic*. Trying to balance quality coworking and hack sessions, with bonding activities in an exciting destination, we hope to gather our great minds for an unforgettable experience.\n\nWe will be staying at a beachfront hotel and will have a co-working space (only for us) from 1pm to 6pm with a coffee break included. In this space, we will be able to:\n\n* Work\n* Hold meetings\n* Provide a dedicated environment for hack sessions\n\n\nThe post-retreat will begin after hotel check-out on Friday and continue until Sunday. The idea is to stay in a cozy house, similar to a hacker house, with more relaxed activities, such as:\n\n* Work together\n* Visiting the TAMAR Project to see sea turtles\n* Dinner in the south of the island\n* Brazilian home-cooked lunch prepared by a chef\n\nUnlike the Bangkok edition, where we focused on the attendance to Devcon as the main event, this edition will follow the “traditional” format of previous locations. After collecting some valuable feedback, we’ve learned our work sessions should be more **focused and oriented**, so we are keeping the touristic/bonding activities on separate days, which will make for a more **productive agenda.**\n\nAgain we are not using travel agents, so contributors can book their own flights or go through Balancer OpCo. This allows us to make our own plans and move faster.\n\nThis proposal seeks to allocate resources for 17 contributors, fostering collaboration and strengthening the Balancer ecosystem. The crew will join a group of 13+ contributors from Balancer Labs, with common expenses split proportionally.\n\nBalancer OpCo will prioritize cost-effectiveness while mindful to ensure a positive experience for contributors traveling a significant distance. This proposal seeks to allocate 35,200 USDC to take 17 contributors to Brazil at $2,070.00/pax. These are initial estimates and we will continue to seek cost savings while ensuring a valuable and enjoyable experience for all attendees.\n\nYou can check [last edition’s proposal](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-690-ecosystem-onsite-proposal-q4-2024/5949) for more info.\n\n### Objectives\n\n1. Drive Balancer Protocol Development: Dedicate focused time and resources to work sessions, hacking, and problem-solving to advance the Balancer Protocol.\n2. Encourage Team Collaboration: Provide opportunities for employees to engage beyond work and facilitate **cross-functional interaction by making it easier for people from different areas to exchange ideas and work together.**\n4. Celebrate Success & Motivate: Recognize achievements and keep the team motivated toward shared goals.\n\n### Pre & Post-Retreat Engagement\n\nPre-Retreat Virtual Events and Groupchats: Virtual icebreakers and team-building activities to build excitement and connections.\n\nPost-Retreat Follow-Up: Feedback form to learn what we did right, and where we can improve to maintain momentum and connection.\n\n### Expected Outcomes\n\n**Stronger Team Connections:** Better relationships and a greater sense of belonging.\n\n**Better Collaboration & Efficiency:** Smoother communication across teams, leading to new ideas and improved workflows.\n\n**Higher Motivation & Retention:** Recognition and support that keep contributors engaged and committed.\n\n### Conclusion\nEcosystem ONsites are an investment in what matters most: our community. By bringing people together, we reinforce DAO culture, encourage collaboration, and create space for new ideas to grow.\n\nThis edition will be a meaningful experience, **especially for onboarding newcomers**, and will help push Balancer forward.\n\n### Specification\n\nThe multisig 0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f will interact with USDC at 0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48 by writing transfer, passing 0x3B8910F378034FD6E103Df958863e5c684072693 as recipient and the amount 35200 as 35200000000.\n\nEdit Maxis:\n- add payload PR",

        "body": "We are set once again to plan another ONsite!\n\nAs a fully decentralized DAO with globally distributed teams, Balancer recognizes the unique challenges (and opportunities) this presents. The ecosystem ONsites aim to address these by fostering genuine connections, enhancing collaboration, and reinforcing our web3 culture.\n\n## TLDR:\n\n* Balancer OpCo Limited will take 14 contributors from the Balancer ecosystem to DevCon 7, in Bangkok, from 12-15 Nov, 2024. :thailand:\n* Proposal includes two extra days for delagging, side events and coworking.\n* Request is capped at $45,762.\n\n## Summary\n\nBalancer is a big think-tank! Twice a year, the Balancer ecosystem hosts a meet-up for DAO contributors and Balancer Labs employees to get together. This is where ideas flourish, bonds become unbreakable and real facetime creates experiences that can last a lifetime.\n\nFor reference, see the last three previous editions here: [Lisbon](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-520-ecosystem-onsite-proposal-q2-2024/5461), [Milan](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-520-ecosystem-onsite-proposal-q2-2024/5461), [Barcelona](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/orb-collective-april-2023-ops-update/4736) (also Bogota and Denver).\n\nAfter the last edition in Lisbon, we collected some valuable feedback. One key takeaway was that 80% of the contributors “*would go anywhere*”, and 35% “*rather have these events when there’s a crypto event next to it*”. In addition, 55% suggested *Asia* as the next destination.\n\nWe decided to cater to that opportunity! :slight_smile: \n\nDevCon 7 is taking place in Southeast Asia, from Nov 12-15, and it is undeniably a top tier irl event for the DeFi and Ethereum communities. This proposal seeks to allocate resources to send 14 contributors to Bangkok, Thailand, fostering collaboration and strengthening the Balancer ecosystem, while connecting with the broader Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nUnlike previous editions, this one will be focused solely on the attendance to Devcon as the main event, so we would like to secure tickets (and builders discounts) as fast as possible. While we will have some extra expenses (tickets and flights at a higher cost) we expect to make savings with less group activities and meeting rooms, also dropping the travel agent so we can book our own plans and move faster.\n\n## Objectives\n\n**1. Strengthen Team Bonds:** Create opportunities for employees to connect on a personal level, building trust and camaraderie.\n**2. Enhance Collaboration:** Facilitate cross-functional interaction and knowledge sharing to spark innovation and drive productivity.\n**3. Reinforce Web3 Culture:** Deepen understanding and alignment with our core values, fostering a sense of belonging to the broader Ethereum ecosystem.\n**4. Celebrate Success & Motivate:** Recognize achievements and inspire continued commitment to our shared goals, specially with the launch of v3 and other produt releases like CowAMM and zenUI.\n\n## Pre & Post-Retreat Engagement\n\n* Pre-Retreat Virtual Events and Groupchats: Virtual icebreakers and team-building activities to build excitement and connections.\n* Post-Retreat Follow-Up: Feedback form to learn what we did right, and where we can improve to maintain momentum and connection.\n\n## Expected Outcomes\n\n* **Improved Team Cohesion & Morale**: Stronger relationships and a greater sense of belonging.\n* **Enhanced Collaboration & Productivity**: Increased cross-functional communication and knowledge sharing, leading to innovative solutions and improved workflows.\n* **Reinforced Web3 Culture**: Deeper understanding of Ethereum ecosystem and alignment with our values, fostering a positive and engaged workforce.\n* **Increased Motivation & Retention**: A sense of appreciation and investment in contributor growth, leading to higher motivation and loyalty.\n\n## Budget\n\nWe acknowledge the current market conditions and budgetary constraints. The proposed budget is intentionally conservative and may not fully cover all attendee travel expenses. Balancer OpCo will prioritize cost-effectiveness while mindful to ensure a positive experience for contributors traveling a significant distance.\n\nThis proposal seeks to allocate resources to take 14 contributors to Bangkok.\n\nBalancer Labs: 4 - tech and scc advisory\nMaxis: 4 - bizdev, devrel and protocol operation\nBalancer OpCo: 3 - product, UI/UX, admin and compliance\nBeethoven: 2 - marketing\nGrants: 1 - devrel, hooks\n\nBreakdown\n$17,800 Flights\n$14,400 Accommodations\n$5,962 Tickets\n$4,800 Meals and per diems\n$2,800 Team activities\n\nTotal request for Devcon 7 allocation: `$45,762`\n\nNote: These are initial estimates. We'll continue to seek cost savings while ensuring a valuable and enjoyable experience for all attendees.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe ecosystem ONsites are investments in our most valuable asset: our community. By fostering connections, collaboration, and a shared sense of purpose, we can strengthen our DAO culture, drive innovation, and achieve greater success together.\n\nWe are confident that this Bangkok edition will be a transformative experience for our team, strengthening our bond and propelling us at Devcon 7 towards greater achievements.\n\n## Specification\n\nIf approved, this proposal authorizes OpCo to plan the event attendance within the specified budget. No token transferred are required at this time, as funds are already unallocated on OpCo's wallet.",

        "body": "### PR with Payload\nhttps://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/308\n\nHello Balancer Community!\n\nHistorically Orb has included the cost of our ONsites into its funding requests. We’ve decided to change that and request a separate, standalone proposal for these events starting with the one we are hoping to have in Q4 of this year. I know it might seem super early to start planning for this, but fear not, we are right on time. We need to get started on location selection because hotel blocks for groups of our size fill up many months in advance.\n\nWe are requesting 93,750 USDC to pay for 25 attendees:\n\n* Maxis: 7\n* Beethoven: 3\n* Integrations (Orbies): 3\n* Grants: 1\n* Foundation: 2\n* OpCo: 5\n* Other Ecosystem Contributors: 4\n\nBalancer Labs will pay for the costs of its attendees.\n\nAs a reminder, the goals of our ecosystem ONsites are to facilitate 1) in-person brainstorms and collaboration meetings and 2) team bonding. We have found the optimal cadence for in-person gatherings to be twice per year. Gathering the ecosystem together in person to discuss, debate and learn from things that went well and didn’t go well over the last six months has proven to be super valuable.\n\nThe agenda for each ONsite includes a Retrospective Meeting to review the last 6 months of work across the ecosystem), a Funding Meeting to plan the roadmap of projects that the ecosystem will work on in the next 6 months, and meetings that are reflective on what’s timely at the time of the event (ie, KPIs, marketing, regulatory, technical vision, mission/vision/values). Having the space and time to hold these meetings in person has been significantly more impactful for our team than having them virtually. In-person meetings allow more fluid conversations and attendees are more likely to build positive relationships through them. Contributors are also able to collaboratively brainstorm easier in person rather than virtually.\n\nHere is some feedback that we received in our follow-up survey after our Q4 2022 ONsite:\n\n* “ONsites are a must for remote-first companies.” - BLabs contributor\n* “Getting to know everyone personally [was my favorite part]. It created an even better feeling when doing video calls now.” - BLabs contributor\n* “Being able to meet the smart contracts team and ask them some questions [was my favorite part].” - OpCo contributor\n* “The organization was great overall and I’ve really enjoyed the experience and getting to know my co-contributors in person :)” - BLabs contributor\n* “We were reasonably frugal.” - BLabs contributor\n* “It was an amazing experience.” - Orb contributor\n* “I found that just a sole opportunity to meet the team and exchange ideas was very valuable.” - BLabs contributor\n\nWe are asking for funding based on our best estimate of what the total ecosystem headcount will be in Q4. If we have more attendees than what we budgeted for, we will need to request additional funding. If we have less, we will return excess funds to the OpCo. It’s worth noting that if that additional funding is not approved we won’t be able to invite new ecosystem members to this ONsite.\n\nWe are estimating that each attendee will cost 3,750 USDC for our five day/four night event. Breakdown of this cost:\n\n* Travel (Flights/Airport Transfers): 1,229 USDC/person\n* Overnight Accommodations: 928 USDC/person\n* Meeting Room Rentals: 82 USDC/person\n* Meals: 594 USDC/person\n* Activities: 332 USDC/person\n* Misc Expenses (ie, covid tests, meeting supplies, etc): 27 USDC/person\n* Canvas Meetings organizer fee: 399 USDC/person\n  * Includes sourcing, contracting, pre-planning, budget management, food & beverage management, vendor and all event logistics management.\n* ONsite event coordinator: 159 USDC/person\n  * Includes 24/7 dedication to our group ensuring everything goes smoothly from start to finish of the event. They monitor and assist with incoming and outgoing travel and make sure that all meetings, meals and activities are set up correctly and go on without a hitch.\n\nWhen planning these events we are always looking for ways to achieve our goals with a cost conscious lens on. Examples of this are not covering costs for flight upgrades and a mix of per diem meals and shared meals versus all shared meals. The Q4 event will be no different. For any funds that aren’t used for this event, we will keep those in our ONsite account and apply it to the next one.\n\nEdit:\n\nThis a capped budget and funds will flow directly through OpCo and OpCo’s wallet. Unused funds can be returned to Treasury. With Orb sunsetting, organization will be handled by Maxis together with OpCo for logistics and BLabs for their own contributors.\n\nIf approved, DAO Treasury 0x10a19e7ee7d7f8a52822f6817de8ea18204f2e4f will transfer 93,750 USD to OpCo's wallet 0x3B8910F378034FD6E103Df958863e5c684072693 to cover ONsite expenses\n\nOpCo’s multisig to receive funds: 0x3B8910F378034FD6E103Df958863e5c684072693",

Gives everyone a lot of flexibility and comfort to work from wherever we want. Either in a remote location away from the busy urban life, or close to home with family and friends nearby, I can speak for all Balancer contributors and say we are most thankful for collaborating in a thriving ecosystem that knows no borders or boundaries. We love web3!\n\nHowever, in-person interactions are the best! Speaking from experience, being present in the past three Balancer ONsite editions (Bogotá, Barcelona and Milan), there’s no doubt there is great value in these irl events. Our last meetup in [Milan ](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-348-ecosystem-onsite-proposal-q4-2023/4700)was an absolute success by kickstarting Balancer V3 work, and now we are set to plan our next interaction in Lisbon, to wrap up and launch V3 to the world.\n\nThis proposal requests budget allocation from the Treasury to fund expenses for DAO contributors (service providers and other key participants) for a week-long meetup filled with activities alongside Balancer Labs contributors.\n\nOrganizing an event is not effortless. As part of the ecosystem liaison role, the Maxis will be taking over this activity (together with BLabs). Time is of the essence, as hotels need to block big sized groups like ours in advance, and flights are never cheap.\n\nWe are currently estimating the event at 3,350 euros per person, allocating 84.755.00 USDC for 23 attendees.\n\n* Balancer Maxis: 7\n* Beethoven X: 5\n* Balancer Foundation: 2\n* Balancer OpCo: 5\n* Other Ecosystem Contributors: 5\n\nBalancer OpCo still holds 38,280.95 USDC from last edition’s budget, so are requesting to top up 46,474.05 USDC. Any unused budget will be kept at OpCo for future use, as governance may direct. Balancer Labs will pay for the costs of its (15) guests, and common expenses will be split proportionally. The total expense/allocation is still well below our projections made in Q3 ($93,750 for [reference](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/balancer-dao-q3-financial-report-and-year-2-3-funding-impact-analysis/5279))\n\nYou can check [last edition’s proposal](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-348-ecosystem-onsite-proposal-q4-2023/4700) for more info.\n\n$23,320.00 Travels and Airport Transfers\n$23,494.40 Accommodations\n$10,890.00 Food and Beverage (including Welcome Reception and Farewell Dinner)\n$3,371.59 Meeting Room expenses\n$7,260.00 Activities\n$5,232.00 Travel agent (including on-site staff expenses, flights and accommodation)\n\n## Learnings\n\nHelping to plan the last Milan ONsite after Orb’s demise, we have learned that big group events are not necessarily cheaper, and we might not find “bulk price” for suppliers like hotels, restaurants, and activities. On the contrary, these vendors might look at events like this as an opportunity to get “full-price” sales instead of discounted retail prices we see on websites.\n\nFurthermore, we found it necessary to have a travel agent with some expertise assisting in this process. We were, however, unhappy with Canva (our contracted service provider for past editions), as their deliverables were not up to their fees and commissions. Alongside Balancer Labs, we are moving to another agent, who is also specialized in corporate events but offers lower fees overall.\n\nNeedless to say, we will make great effort to bring down the values presented here, as negotiations with suppliers are just getting started. These are initial quotes and estimates. The Maxis have a proven track record of successfully fighting unnecessary expenditures and championing savings across the board.\n\nIt is our intent to get it below 3k euros per person, but we also want our contributors to feel good about coming to these meetups. We understand they are leaving their families for the week and most of them are flying long distances (no business class tickets!), so bonding and comfort are also very important to us!\n\n## Specification\n\nThe DAO multisig on Ethereum 0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f will send 46,474.05 USDC to Balancer OpCo’s wallet 0x3B8910F378034FD6E103Df958863e5c684072693",

        "body": "https://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/701\n\n**Service Provider Name:** Beethoven X DAO\n\n**Core Contributor(s):** franz, groninge, daniel\n\n**Pledge to abide by the DAO’s [Code of Conduct](https://www.notion.so/fef15e2ed1f5453f8bd56f338c70bb88?pvs=21) (or link to your own):** Yes\n\n**Pledge to abide by the [Accountability Guidelines](https://www.notion.so/229d93372403415688f8d3dc4cb964b1?pvs=21):** Yes\n\n**Introduction & Domains of Operation:**\n\nSince the passing of [BIP-254](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-254-funding-proposal-for-beethoven-x-dao/4652) and it’s subsequent extension ([BIP-393](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-393-fund-beethoven-x-dao-technical-for-aug-dec/4958) and [BIP-394](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-394-fund-beethoven-x-dao-marketing-for-aug-dec/4973)), the Beethoven X DAO has functioned as a Balancer Service Provider since May 1, 2023. This proposal aims to extend the technical services and advisory component for an additional 6 months (January 1, 2024 - June 30, 2024). As in the previous proposals, marketing services provided by the Beethoven X DAO are submitted as a [separate proposal](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-xx-funding-proposal-for-the-beethoven-x-dao-marketing-sp-jan-jun-24/5406).\n\nOur primary roles include API team lead (franz), frontend contributor (groninge) and ecosystem technical lead (daniel). While the past nine months have been turbulent at times, we strongly believe it has once again demonstrated the resilience of the Balancer DAO and the entire ecosystem. Despite a [key service provider winding down](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/rfc-orb-collective-s-path-forward/4778), several core contributors stepping down, and a [critical vulnerability](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/vulnerability-found-in-some-pools/5102), we are collectively still here, building.\n\nThe upcoming release of Balancer V3 presents an opportunity for Balancer to regain narrative and establish ourselves as the platform to empower current and future AMM innovation. We are hugely optimistic in the future of Balancer Protocol and steadfast in our dedication to support the ecosystem to the best of our abilities. As we work towards Balancer V3, it has been inspiring to participate in the development of a more cohesive technology stack to empower the future of the protocol. A technology stack that leverages the collective experiences and expertise of contributors across the ecosystem, avoiding siloed development strategies that lead to unnecessary system complexity in Balancer V2.\n\nAs we operate as a small part of a much larger system, our successes are enabled by many across the ecosystem. As such, we present a broader ecosystem update below that touches on our specific contributions when relevant. As we continue to find the best way to bring value to the Balancer ecosystem, we welcome community feedback.\n\n**Integrations**\n\nThree Rocks recently [announced](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/integrations-team-three-rocks-november-2023-update/5408) their decision to wind down effective December 2023. Both @rabmarut and @gerg have been long time contributors to the Balancer ecosystem. We’d like to extend a thank you to the entire Three Rocks organization, they are a team of talented engineers who made countless contributions to the protocol as well as serving as the technical interface to external partners, they will be missed. \n\nOver the last few months, there has been ecosystem wide discussions around the future of integrations at Balancer, resulting in with what we see as a very positive outcome to a challenging situation. Effective January 2024, the responsibilities of the integrations team will transition to Balancer Labs under the leadership of John Grant. With John Grant’s extensive knowledge of the entire Balancer ecosystem and the support of existing Three Rocks team member @Mkflow27, integrations will become a part of what is currently the Balancer Labs SDK team. With expertise in both on- and off-chain integrations into Balancer Protocol, we see this team as being well suited to fill the gap left by Three Rocks. While John is on a well deserved parental leave, I have been working directly with mkflow to help facilitate a smooth transition.\n\nWe’d additionally like to extend a huge thanks to Fernando and the entire Balancer Labs team for their willingness to take on the responsibilities and costs for integrations moving forward. This significantly reduces the operational costs incurred by the DAO, and is yet another example of Balancer Labs' ongoing commitment to the long-term success of the Balancer protocol.\n\n**Smart Contracts**\n\nBalancer V3 has been the core focus of the Smart Contracts team for the majority of the last two quarters. While the feature set has not yet been publicly disclosed, we are extremely excited about the technical direction of Balancer V3. Architecturally speaking, there has been a focus on:\n\n- Interface design - with the overarching goal of making it significantly easier to integrate with Balancer protocol.\n- Reducing overall system complexity\n- Improved code readability by reducing inheritance depth and leveraging libraries for composition.\n\nInternally, the smart contracts team is on track to complete its second major milestone at the end of this year, a first MVP of the core contracts of Balancer V3. It has been an absolute pleasure collaborating closely with @juani, @endymionjkb and @ylv. I think I can speak for the entire team when I say that we’re very much looking forward to sharing more details on Balancer V3 publicly.\n\n**SDK**\n\nProgress on the new [b-sdk](https://github.com/balancer/b-sdk) has continued over the past two quarters, and it is fast approaching feature complete for Balancer V2. In contrast to the existing [Balancer SDK](https://github.com/balancer/balancer-sdk), the new b-sdk is highly focused on facilitating on-chain interactions with the Balancer Protocol. Data intensive operations are now delegated to the Balancer API, allowing the SDK to be focused in its goals. The SDK team has additionally been a huge contributor in interface design for Balancer V3, their in-depth understandings of V2 integration pain points have been invaluable in the process.\n\nAn important initiative worth highlighting is the cross-organizational effort to implement a generalized approach for [price impact calculations](https://github.com/balancer/b-sdk/blob/d8dc287253160d20c877a57ac4c4c60190b22770/src/entities/priceImpact/index.ts) in the b-sdk. Spearheaded by @brunoguerios from the SDK team and @ZenDragon from the Maxis, their efforts have produced a first iteration of a generalized approach that will reliably calculate price impact for all pool actions, irrespective of the underlying invariant implementation. This is a massively valuable development for the entire ecosystem.\n\n**Frontend**\n\nThe upcoming release of Balancer V3 presents an opportunity for a new take on the existing frontend application. OpCo and Beethoven X contributors have spent the last several months laying the groundwork on a new version of the Balancer Frontend. With a fresh new look, the new Balancer Product will be:\n\n- Multi-chain native to allow for quick exploration of liquidity pools across all Balancer supported networks.\n- API powered to facilitate fast loading times, overcoming many of the data challenges plaguing the current V2 application.\n- Version agnostic to ensure that any liquidity that stays on V2 will benefit from the streamlined UX.\n- Designed with a flexible architecture, with the goal to easily support all current and future pool types.\n\nLed by @gareth, OpCo and Beethoven X contributors are collectively leveraging their extensive Balancer domain knowledge to build a better product.\n\n**API**\n\nAs the limitations of the subgraph have been a constant bottleneck for V2, the Balancer Labs Data team, lead by @mendesfabio, have made the decision that future versions of the Balancer subgraph will be focused primarily on data extraction (E). This is in recognition that the API is better suited for the role of data transformation (T) and loading (L). As the API will play an important role in the Balancer tech stack, former SDK team member Jarek has transitioned to the API team and we expect that there will be a close collaboration between the API and Data teams as we move towards Balancer V3.\n\nBelow, we present general API updates, written by Beethoven X DAO contributor franz, API team lead:\n\nOver the last months, our main effort went into getting the API ready for the new frontend-v3 and the b-sdk. As the frontend aims to serve a multi-chain user experience, the API must also support these requirements. Working closely together with OpCo, requirements for queries have been defined and implemented one-by-one as they are needed in the development process. \n\nMany other, smaller changes have also been integrated into the API to support data needs for the new frontend such as specific filters, rate provider data, FX pools support or yield fee specifics.\n\nAdditionally, the API is also used in the new b-sdk to “enrich” pool data that is being used for various pool operations. Together with Balancer Labs we defined the requirements for the API and integrated the changes. These requirements mainly comprise specific needs on nested pools, token indexes or other token data.\n\nAdditional points of interest:\n\n- In August, BASE chain was integrated into the API which is responsible for serving pricing data to the UI.\n- Optimizations have been made to the infrastructure deployment that resulted in a more cost effective solution. In addition, more changes are planned that should further reduce the cost of operating the infrastructure.\n- On November 27th, we successfully deprecated the veBal voting-gauges.json file in GitHub in favor of the API. All known partners have migrated and will query the API in the future. With this change we automate a manual operations task, reducing manual work.\n- We have helped the community in Discord with questions regarding development, inner workings of the UI and API, to help them understand the liquidity mining or voting processes from Balancer and with general questions.\n- We’ve supported the Balancer Maxis with their data needs for the gauge rewards automation program. Also, showcasing the rich data set that the API has on Balancer pools and how to make use of it.\n\n**Key Objectives & Success Metrics:**\n\n- **Make it easier to build on Balancer** - Having become domain experts on Balancer tech, Beethoven X collaborators are uniquely positioned to identify and help build solutions for many of the pain points that exist in the current Balancer tech stack.\n- **Reduce duplicate effort across the ecosystem** - A joint API deployment is the first of several projects we see where Beethoven X contributors can leverage their domain expertise to reduce duplicate effort. How do we as an ecosystem invest significantly more energy into the future success of Balancer protocol and spend less time on the problems of today?\n- **Help drive the direction of the Balancer protocol** - We believe Balancer protocol should be a platform that empowers current and future AMM innovation. We will continue to work to align the various parties in the balancer ecosystem around this vision. How do we put a true focus on this goal? How do we empower developers to build the next generation of AMMs on Balancer protocol?\n\n**Length of Engagement & Budget:**\n\nBeethoven X DAO is requesting 6 months of funding starting January 1, 2024 and ending June 30, 2023.\n\nWe request a budget of $29,000 USDC per month for technical development and advisory. The increase of $4,000 USDC per month reflects increased involvement from groninge on the development of the new v3 frontend.\n\n**ETH Address to Receive Funds:** 0x811912c19eEF91b9Dc3cA52fc426590cFB84FC86",
