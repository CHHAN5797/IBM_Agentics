        "body": "[Non-constitutional] \n\nExecutive Summary\nAs voted on in the ADPC proposal, one of the key tasks of the ADPC was to conceptualize and structure a subsidy fund for the Arbitrum DAO. This proposal intends to set up this subsidy fund, seeking up to $10 million worth of ARB to be administered and selected by the Arbitrum DAO Procurement Committee (hereinafter referred to as the ‘ADPC’) to facilitate the selection of projects that will benefit from the whitelisted security audit service providers selected via the ADPC’s procurement framework. The ultimate decision will be made by the ADPC based on the Means Test and the Application Process Terms 13.\n\nProposal Request\nWe propose the creation of a procurement subsidy fund allocating up to $10 million worth of ARB to provide financial assistance to both new and existing projects within the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\nThese subsidies will be exclusive to a pre-approved whitelisted set of security audit service providers, selected by the ADPC, who will publicly display their fees. This approach eliminates the need for the ADPC to assess the reasonableness of funds requests.\n\nThe aim of the subsidy fund is to incentivise participation and growth among smaller projects helping them to overcome barriers to entry, such as challenges to acquire funding to pay for the cost of robust security audits.\n\nThe figure of up to $10 million worth of ARB has been determined via a benchmarking exercise conducted with various security audit service providers. This form 4 was shared with these service providers and based on the responses of 10 service providers (including the likes of Spearbit, Halborn, Nethermind, Three Sigma, Guardian, Zellic, etc.) on their scope of services and fees associated, we have estimated that each project will require a 2-month security audit at an average cost of $200K. This will enable the ADPC to potentially fund up to 50 projects; however, it should be noted that the average of $200K is an estimate and fees are usually specific to each project, each project requires a scoping exercise, and audit costs will vary based on the size of the codebase, complexity, etc.\n\nWe ask delegates delegates to choose between following options for the initial size of the fund and length of the program:\n- Do not fund the program\n- 1 cohort of 8 weeks (2 months) for a total fund size of $2.5 million\n- 2 cohorts of 8 weeks each (4 months) for a total fund size of $5 million\n- 4 cohorts of 8 weeks each (8 months) for a total fund size of $10 million\n- Abstain\n\nPlease review the forum post (linked below) for a full proposal description and discussion.",

        "body": "##### **Abstract**\nCreating a procurement framework for security-oriented service providers within the ArbitrumDAO. The proposal aims to create a streamlined & harmonised approach re. service procurement for security-oriented services.\n\n##### **Motivation**\nProcurement Frameworks maintain quality control, ensuring consistency in the services procured. These frameworks also promote transparency and fairness, building trust and adhering to legal standards. Moreover, they aid in risk management, safeguarding against various procurement-related risks, and streamline processes for time-saving and operational efficiency.\n\n##### **Rationale**\nThis procurement framework is designed to ensure that only qualified and reliable security service providers are selected, thereby safeguarding the integrity and security of the projects within the Arbitrum Ecosystem. This will aid in ensuring that the security-specific needs of projects building within the Ecosystem are safeguarded to a larger extent & thus serve to safeguard the high standards and reputation of the Arbitrum Ecosystem.\n\n##### **Specifications & Timeline**\nSpecifications & Timeline can be found in the following sections.\n\n###### **Steps to Implement**\nThis AIP will move to a Snapshot vote on the 24th of November 2023. Passing of the Snapshot vote will be deemed as a ratification of the Procurement Framework. There are no associated costs with the implementation of the Procurement Framework.\n\n##### **Overall Cost**\nNo cost for AIP implementation.\n\n---\n\n## **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**\n\n- This procurement process is designed to ensure that only the most qualified and reliable security service providers are selected, thereby safeguarding the integrity and security of the projects within the Arbitrum Ecosystem.\n- Should the ArbitrumDAO vote for the implementation/ratification of this framework, we wil then be proposing the setup of the Procurement Committee that will facilitate & administer this framework.\n- The proposal for the procurement committee will also contain further details on the operational implementations that are to be effected in documenting, record-keeping, and disclosing material in relation to the procurement framework.\n\nThe document outlines a comprehensive procurement framework for the Arbitrum Ecosystem, focusing on sourcing and selecting service providers for blockchain security and related services. It comprises several key components:\n\n- Needs Assessment: Identifying and prioritizing the specific requirements of the Arbitrum Ecosystem, including evaluating the current situation and determining market availability for the required services.\n- Defining Eligibility Criteria: Establishing standards for technical expertise, reputation, tools and techniques, and financial stability that service providers must meet to be considered.\n- Publication of Request for Proposal (RFP): Detailing the scope of work required and the submission guidelines for prospective service providers, along with evaluation criteria and a timeline for the procurement process.\n- Proposal Submission: Requiring service providers to submit comprehensive documentation for evaluation, with submissions made via ArbitrumDAO Forums, allowing community feedback and private collection of sensitive information.\n- Evaluation of Proposals: This includes initial screening for eligibility, in-depth technical and commercial evaluations, reference checks, and possibly interviews, with a focus on transparency and community involvement.\n- Whitelisting, Onboarding & Contracting: Selecting the most suitable service providers, conducting Know-Your-Business processes, facilitating contract negotiations, and finalizing approval of agreements.\n- Ongoing Obligations and Ancillary Matters: Monitoring performance, establishing feedback loops, setting renewal criteria, outlining exit strategies, and ensuring thorough documentation and record-keeping using tools like Airtable for transparency.\n- Public Disclosure: Making key details of the procurement process and the list of whitelisted providers publicly available, respecting confidentiality agreements.\n\n![](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/9/96d131d75a56e3d72921707f2756d78262307f1a_2_548x411.png)\n\n---\n\n## OVERVIEW\n\n[1] On the 3rd of November, DK (Myself) posted a proposal on the Arbitrum DAO Forums aimed at establishing a framework for security-oriented proposals via a consolidated framework ([Consolidate Security Proposals into a RFP Process](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-consolidate-security-proposals-into-a-rfp-process/19328)). By way of a summary, the proposal on the Arbitrum DAO forum discusses establishing a Request for Proposal (RFP) process to consolidate the selection of auditors and security service providers within the Arbitrum ecosystem (for the purposes of this endeavor, we shall be referring to this consolidated framework as the ‘Procurement Framework).\n\n[2] The Snapshot Vote for the establishment of the aforementioned Procurement Framework has since passed ([Snapshot 1](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x1ac6079871dc4af55b7d67eae130e4c1bbcbabd9bb35405bc1733ef2efe45875)).\n\n[3] On the 10th of November, Immutablelawyer posted a public consultation period on the Arbitrum Forums ([Public Consultation re. 'Consolidate Security Proposals into an RFP Process'](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/public-consultation-re-consolidate-security-proposals-into-an-rfp-process/19478)). This contained a base-line framework aimed at giving some context to community members & relevant stakeholders intending on participating in the public consultation. The Public Consultation ended on the 22nd of November 2023. Following calls held, submissions received & several discussions with numerous ecosystem participants, we would now like to present the final procurement framework for ratification via Snapshot.\n\nWe would like to thank all participants who took their time to provide insight in this endeavor. This was a true testament to the collaborative nature of this ecosystem.\n\nCopy of Proposal in Google Docs: [Snapshot Proposal Ratification: Procurement Framework](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1g1W9BYCNMYWi67E4Zj_TjdtCke321fTL3yhpIuo73HY/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n---\n\n## [Procurement Framework for Ratification](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-non-constitutional-procurement-framework-security-service-providers/19704#procurement-framework-for-ratification-2)\n\n### **1. ‘Needs’ Assessment**\n\n- Gather Phase: Collect detailed information on what is needed in the Arbitrum Ecosystem. This involves understanding the specific requirements of the end-users, the goals of relevant stakeholders, and any constraints (budgetary, time, legal, regulatory, procedural etc.). This stage often involves interviews, surveys, or group discussions with stakeholders.\n- Analyze Current Situation: Assess the current resources, systems, or services in place. Determine if there are gaps between the current state and the desired state. This analysis should consider whether existing solutions can be upgraded or if new solutions are needed.\n- Define the Scope of the Need: Clearly define what is needed to address the gap identified in the current situation analysis. This definition should be as specific as possible, outlining the functionalities, features, quality standards, quantities, and any other relevant attributes that are relevant.\n- Prioritize Needs: Not all needs have the same level of urgency or importance. Prioritize the needs based on factors like strategic importance, impact on operations, cost-benefit analysis, risk mitigation, and regulatory compliance.\n- Assess Market Availability: Research the market to understand what products or services are available that meet the needs identified above.\n\n### **1.1. Defining Eligibility Criteria**\n\n- Technical Expertise: Prospective Service Providers must demonstrate expertise in blockchain security, including prior experience with smart contracts, the Ethereum network, and Layer 2 solutions like Arbitrum.\n- Reputation: A track record of successful security audits, with references and case studies.\n- Tools and Techniques: Tools for detecting vulnerabilities, including static and dynamic analysis, and formal verification methods.\n- Financial Stability: Proof of financial stability to ensure the longevity and reliability of the service provider.\n\n### **2. Publication of the Request for Proposal (RFP)**\n\n- Scope of Work: Following the conclusion of the ‘Needs Assessment’ in the Procurement Committee will publish a request for submissions. This will be done via the ArbitrumDAO Forums wherein a detailed description of services required, including security audit scope, frequency, and expected deliverables will be provided by the PC.\n- Submission Guidelines: Clear instructions on how to apply, including formats and submission channels will be provided for prospective applicants so that the approach is harmonized in nature.\n- Evaluation Criteria: Metrics on how prospective service providers [as per ‘Eligibility Critera’].\n- Timeline: Submission deadlines and timeline for the evaluation process.\n\n### **3. Proposal Submission**\n\n- Documentation: Applicant service providers must submit comprehensive documentation, including company profiles, client testimonials, and detailed descriptions of methodologies.\n- Submissions: Will be effected on a dedicated section of the ArbitrumDAO Forums. This way, the PC can already get a sense of community feedback prior to putting the security service provider through the procurement process. Financial statements will & other ancillary information will not be required to be posted publicly but will be collected through private channels.\n\n### **4. Evaluation of Proposals**\n\n- Initial Screening: Verification of compliance with the minimum eligibility criteria.\n- Technical Evaluation: In-depth review of technical capabilities, methodologies, and tools.\n- Commercial Evaluation: Assessment of cost-effectiveness and value for money.\n- References Check: Verification of the provider’s references and past performance.\n- Interviews: The PC may conduct interviews with the top candidates.\n- Emphasis should be placed on documenting each step of the procurement process and communicating select steps in a consolidated manner to the community for review & input.\n- In this regard, the PC can set up a dedicated notion page wherein the aforementioned details can be inputted, and then linked from the Forum updates posted by the PC.\n\n### **5. Whitelisting, Onboarding & Contracting**\n\n- Selection: The PC will select the most suitable providers to be whitelisted for service-subsidies based on them validly passing the procurement process.\n- The PC will facilitate Know-Your-Business processes so as to make sure that all prospectively whitelisted service providers pass standard KYB checks.\n- Contract Negotiation: The PC will facilitate & administer the process for the finalization of the contractual provisions regulating the engagement between the service provider chosen by the projects & the project itself. Most importantly, the PC has to ensure that the pricing ‘advertised’ by the service provider for the service requested is consistent with the agreement.\n- Approval: Final agreements will be reviewed and approved by the PC before signing.\n\n#### **Ongoing Obligations of the Procurement Committee & Ancillary Matters**\n\n##### [i] _**Performance Monitoring and Review**_\n\n- Regular Audits: Random checks by the PC during the audit process so as to ensure compliance with SLAs.\n- Feedback Loop: A system for feedback from the projects utilizing the subsidized services. This will be pivotal in ensuring that the PC maintains a certain level of quality assurance so as to consistently assess whether any factors that led to the service provider passing the procurement process have changed.\n\n##### [ii] _**Renewal and Exit Procedures**_\n\n- Renewal Criteria: Every 4 months, the PC will re-evaluate whitelisted service providers by carrying out an assessment re. The Eligibility Criteria so as to make sure that Service Providers are still eligible.\n- Exit Strategy: If a Service Provider is removed from the whitelist, the PC will publish an announcement outlining the reasons thereof.\n\n##### [iii] _**Documentation and Record Keeping**_\n\n- Audit Trail: All stages of the procurement process will be documented and records maintained for accountability and transparency.\n- The PC will be using Airtable to document every stage of the procurement process.\n\n##### [iv] _**Public Disclosure**_\n\n- Transparency: Key details of the procurement process and the list of whitelisted providers will be made publicly available, respecting confidentiality agreements.\n\nWe look forward to your final feedback and potentially seeking the framework in action!\n\n#### Voting\nFor: Proceed with this framework, start discussions on PC Leadership\nAgainst: Do not move forward with this framework, it needs revision",

        "body": "## Abstract\nThis proposal aims to streamline the LTIPP bounty process by allowing the LTIPP council more autonomy in choosing who completes each bounty. This will help create a faster-moving selection system with more accountability, allowing the DAO to gather more insights into the results of the incentive campaigns.\n## Motivation\nThe LTIPP proposal included up to 200,000 ARB available for research on STIP, the Backfund, and the LTIP Pilot Program. The bounties guarantee the DAO will have multiple teams working on providing meaningful conclusions regarding the incentive programs. These conclusions will be essential to allow the DAO to possess all the information necessary to create the best possible long-term incentive framework.\nHowever, in its current format, it will take multiple months and many DAO votes to decide who will complete each bounty. This proposal aims to streamline that process so that more teams can research Arbitrum Incentives programs in a timely manner. By allowing the LTIPP council more freedom in using the bounty funds, we can move faster to start the bounties the same week as the start incentives.\n## Rationale\nThis new process not only speeds things up but also creates more accountability and can lead to more teams applying to fulfill bounties.\nDAO-wide votes to select who completes each bounty can become a popularity contest. This discourages less well-connected or busy researchers from applying, as they don’t want to deal with the struggle of lobbying every delegate.\nHowever, allowing the elected LTIPP council to choose the most qualified teams without the researchers worrying about lobbying and DAO politics will encourage more bounty applications. This will lead to more options to choose from and result in better overall research being done.\nThis new process for selecting bounties also adds accountability, as the decision is made by a small group instead of the entire DAO. The DAO delegates might not want to take the time or have the expertise to read and understand each application. Additionally, it is hard to assign accountability for decisions when they are made by large groups like DAOs.\nHowever, with a smaller group making the decisions, more accountability and expertise will be placed in each decision, leading to better outcomes for the DAO. The LTIPP council comprises strong teams and individuals elected by the community who have the DAOs’ best interests in mind. The council has intimate knowledge of the incentives programs and understands what needs to be studied to create a new and improved incentives program.\n## Specifications\nThe LTIPP proposal allocated a maximum of 200k ARB for research bounties. To streamline the process, this proposal allows the council to choose who fulfills each bounty. The proposed new bounty format is as follows.\n#### Bounty Submission\nStarting May 20th, researchers can apply for bounties by submitting applications on the forum. The council will put out a list of bounties they would like researched but researchers can also submit their own ideas for bounties.\n####  Bounty Feedback\nApplications for research bounties will be due June 3rd. The council and delegates will give feedback on the forum up until the 3rd to give feedback and allow people to alter their applications.\n#### Bounty Selection\nThe LTIPP council will then select which bounties to fund on June 10th. Researchers whose bounty is selected would start their research immediately upon selection. This will align nicely with the start of LTIPP incentives beginning on June 3rd.\n#### Bounty Payments\nResearchers will be paid half of their bounty upon completing KYC and half of it upon completing their bounty. The LTIPP workstream will monitor the bounties throughout the program to ensure the bounties are completed and payments are made.\n## Steps to Implement\n* Complete Snapshot vote to give more autonomy to the LTIPP council.\n* Have teams submit proposals for bounties\n* The council selects which bounties to fund\n* Research starts\n* Researcher’s selected for bounties complete KYC\n* Half of the bounty is paid once KYC is completed\n* Half of the bounty is paid upon completion of the research\n## Timeline\n* Snapshot Vote: May 22 - May 29th\n* Application Period: May 22 - June 3rd\n* Selection Period: June 3rd - June 10th\n* Research: June 10th - September\n## Overall Cost\nThere is no additional cost to this proposal. The funding will come from the 200K arb budget from the LTIPP proposal.",

    "summary": "This proposal seeks to establish a new sub-committee to administer the Security Services Subsidy Fund with dedicated funding and an 8-week term. The forum discussion reveals a predominantly negative sentiment toward creating an additional committee, with many community members and delegates expressing concerns about unnecessary complexity, delays, and duplication of efforts. Similar recent proposals have shown that adding layers of governance can lead to delays and inefficiencies without clear added value. The timeline metrics show early and stable support for the 'For' option, but the market impact and community sentiment suggest caution. The recommendation is to maintain the current governance structure, allowing the existing ADPC to handle the subsidy fund to maximize organizational efficiency and minimize bureaucratic overhead.",
