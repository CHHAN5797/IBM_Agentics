        "body": "Users of AAVE that lend and borrow pegged assets are at a higher risk of liquidation than justified due to the implementation of the oracle. I propose that prices for stablecoin assets be calculated by making use of lower variance price feeds. This proposal would be limited to USDC, USDT, and DAI for now, but could expand if Chainlink adds more price feeds. \n\nBackground:\nThe prices of assets in AAVE, and by extension the debt ratio, are calculated by Chainlink oracles which convert all asset prices directly to ETH (which are converted in the frontend to a dollar price). Chainlink price feeds to ETH are designed to update only when the price deviates from the previous price by 1% or more. This means that your debt ratio can rise by about 2% simply by random chance. This is not to mention the fact that Chainlink may update different price feeds at different blocks creating a further divergence in debt ratio.\n\nThe Proposal:\nWhen the relevant price feeds are available and can be considered reliable, convert assets to their pegged equivalents before converting the price to ETH. Because the variance of the USD to ETH price calculation would be shared by all USD pegged assets that supported the feed, the debt ratio between pegged assets would only be affected by the variance of the asset's price around the peg.\n\nBefore:\nUSDC -> ETH\nUSDT -> ETH\n\nAfter:\nUSDC -> USD -> ETH\nUSDT -> USD -> ETH\n\nhttps://data.chain.link/ethereum/mainnet/stablecoins\nhttps://governance.aave.com/t/proposal-provide-better-oracle-mechanism-for-stablecoins/4720\n\nfeels weird being the first one in here....",

        "body": "## Simple Summary\n\nA proposal to adjust two (2) total risk parameters, including Liquidation Threshold and Loan To Value, across one (1) Aave V2 asset. \n\n\n## Motivation\n\nThis set of recommendations follows [AIP 117](https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/?proposalId=117) to further de-risk the REN market. \n\n### Supporting Data on Aave V2\n\n**Top 30 borrowers’ aggregate positions & borrow usages**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ktXGW6P.png)\n\n**Top 30 borrowers’ entire supply**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/zoCKkVn.png)\n\n**Top 30 borrowers’ entire borrows**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/xO974Ct.png)\n\n**Price changes of key assets since 2022-11-03**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/9D7yUOW.png)\n\n**Time series of Value at Risk (VaR) since 2022-11-03**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/R8enrDr.png)\n\n**Top 10 REN suppliers and percentage of total REN supplies:**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/m3qrkWx.png)\n\n**Top 10 REN suppliers and borrow usages:**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/CNBpVd8.png)\n\n**Entire supply positions for top 10 REN suppliers:**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/rMEczds.png)\n\n**Entire borrow positions for top 10 REN suppliers:**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/HEKWdu8.png)\n\n\nBelow, Gauntlet analyzes the user which contributes the most Value at Risk per our simulations.\n\nUser: `0x364d5077c4c6bce6280705fe657fc4c55fdac363`\n\n**User supply breakdown**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/QZW65gh.png)\n\n**Relevant collateral factors**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/nOdid9p.png)\n\n**User borrowing power breakdown**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/xsPK0i7.png)\n\n**User borrows breakdown**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/1Tz7Anr.png)\n\n**User borrow usage**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Tnwhl0a.png)\n\nNote that this user has been elastic as of late, updating their token positions often.\n\n\n## Aave V2 Parameter Changes Specification\n\nGauntlet's simulation engine will continue to adjust risk parameters to maintain protocol market risk at safe levels while optimizing for capital efficiency.\n\nThese parameter recommendations reflect the unique situation of REN in the current market conditions.  \n\n| Parameter | Current Value | Recommended Value |\n| -------- | -------- | -------- |\n| **REN Liquidation Threshold**     | 65%     | ***60%***     |\n| **REN Loan To Value**     | 60%     | ***55%***     |\n\n\n\n## Notable Accounts to Flag\n\nAs of 11/16/2022, the data shows that only one dust account, `0x0e1337ea2c604f9a937d2623af206cdd02167b38` would be liquidated as a result of these parameter updates. This account has a total of ~$100 in supply.\n\nThis could change if prices move significantly. On a daily basis, up until this proposal is executed, we will check whether these parameter updates will cause any liquidations and update the community on this forum post.\n\n\n\n## Risk Dashboard\n\nThe community should use Gauntlet's [Aave V2 Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/aave) to understand better the updated parameter suggestions and general market risk in Aave V2. Gauntlet has also launched the [Aave Arc Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/aave_arc).\n\nValue at Risk represents the 95th percentile **insolvency value** that occurs from simulations we run over a range of volatilities to approximate a tail event. \n\nLiquidations at Risk represents the 95th percentile **liquidation volume** that occurs from simulations we run over a range of volatilities to approximate a tail event.\n\n\n\n## Next Steps\n* Targeting an AIP on 2022-11-21\n\n## Quick Links\n[Analytics Dashboard](https://metabase.gauntlet.network/public/dashboard/f4930651-29be-4ff3-b664-a34462e286c5)\n[Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/aave)\n[Aave Arc Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/aave_arc)\n[Gauntlet Parameter Recommendation Methodology](https://medium.com/gauntlet-networks/gauntlets-parameter-recommendation-methodology-8591478a0c1c)\n[Gauntlet Model Methodology](https://medium.com/gauntlet-networks/gauntlets-model-methodology-ea150ff0bafd) \n\nGauntlet launched an insolvency refund for Aave that contains a portion of our payment stream that can be clawed back in the event of insolvencies due to market risk. Since our last recommendation there have been no new insolvencies in Aave. Gauntlet’s Insolvency Refund vault is still live and can be seen here [0x7667095Caa12b79fCa489ff6E2198Ca01fDAe057](https://etherscan.io/address/0x7667095Caa12b79fCa489ff6E2198Ca01fDAe057)\n\n*By approving this proposal, you agree that any services provided by Gauntlet shall be governed by the terms of service available at gauntlet.network/tos.*",

New assets are required to be listed with an initial LTV of 0%.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\n\nSince Gauntlet began its partnership with the Aave protocol, we have received requests from the Community to analyze asset listings. Community members, developers, and other stakeholders often asked us questions like, \"how much liquidity should this asset have before being listed? What should the asset's initial parameters be? How do we protect the protocol from insolvency?\" \n\nGauntlet's framework focuses specifically on market risk and how Gauntlet will support the asset listing process in Aave. Our framework can be found [here](https://www.notion.so/gauntlet/Aave-Asset-Listing-Framework-Market-Risk-7c29d448924f444abfa9681410c707c3). This will work in conjunction with [Aave's existing asset listing framework](https://docs.aave.com/governance/guides/new-asset-listing). \n\nListing assets is essential to the growth of the protocol. As new assets in DeFi proliferate and older assets fall out of favor, Aave must list and delist assets to maintain its usefulness as a protocol. Gauntlet will conduct these risk assessments prior to new assets being listed, given 2 weeks of notice and strong community buy-in.\n\nNotably, we recommend that LTV and Liquidation Threshold be set to 0% on the initial listing. In other words, assets will not be allowed to be used as collateral upon their initial listing. \n\nHistorically, the community has listed assets with non-zero LTV and Liquidation Threshold. Because there are risks in doing so, this Snapshot vote helps the community align on best practices moving forward.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nCommunity input is valuable because requiring that assets are listed with an initial LTV of 0% imposes important trade-offs:\n\n1. Not requiring assets to be listed with an initial LTV of 0% can potentially allow the asset to have more utility (depending on the asset) from the onset of listing. Thus, the protocol may be earning revenue at the onset of the listing (driven by increased borrows). However, when assets are enabled as collateral from the initial listing, the protocol immediately faces the technical and market risks inherent in adding another risk vector to the protocol. The protocol is only as strong as its weakest link.\n2. Requiring assets to be listed with an initial LTV of 0% can protect the protocol from unforeseen mechanism, smart contract, and other technical risks. In addition, setting an initial LTV of 0% allows the protocol to observe how supply and borrow usage as well as liquidity conditions evolve following the asset listing. This data enables more robust risk analysis and fine-tuning of LTV and Liquidation Threshold parameters following the initial asset listing. The tradeoff is that until an asset is enabled as collateral, usage may be limited (depending on the asset), and thus, the protocol faces an opportunity cost of revenue. We view this as a minuscule opportunity cost (e.g., a few weeks of revenue attributable to the asset) relative to the risks. Assets can be turned on as collateral, but being turned off as collateral is a more difficult process with increased user friction.\n\n\nOption 1 above should not be interpreted as suggesting that all assets should be enabled as collateral. It simply allows for the possibility that assets can be listed with an initial non-zero LTV should the community deem the asset a collateral asset.\n\nShould the community favor Option 2, assets should be listed with an initial LTV of 0%, and a separate proposal must be proposed by the community at some point after the initial listing to enable the asset as collateral. At that point in time, given strong community buy-in, Gauntlet will conduct market risk analysis to recommend LTV and Liquidation Threshold parameters.\n\n## Next Steps\n\n\n* This Snapshot vote has the below options:\n1. Not all assets are required to be listed with an initial LTV of 0%.\n2. All assets are required to be listed with an initial LTV of 0%. After 2-3 weeks of operation as a non-collateral asset, the community can propose turning it on as collateral. At that point, Gauntlet will make parameter recommendations as per our Notion document below.\n\n\n\n\n\n### Quick Links\n[Gauntlet Asset Listing Framework for Market Risk](https://www.notion.so/gauntlet/Aave-Asset-Listing-Framework-Market-Risk-7c29d448924f444abfa9681410c707c3)\n\n\n\n\n\n*By approving this proposal, you agree that any services provided by Gauntlet shall be governed by the terms of service available at gauntlet.network/tos.*\n\n",

        "body": "## Simple Summary\n\nA proposal to adjust five (5) total risk parameters, including Loan-to-Value, Liquidation Threshold, and Liquidation Bonus, across two (2) Aave V3 Optimism assets.\n\n## Motivation\n\nChaos Labs’ Parameter Recommendation Platform runs hundreds of thousands of agent-based off-chain and on-chain simulations to examine how different Aave V3 risk parameters configurations would behave under adverse market conditions - and find the optimal values to maximize protocol borrow usage while minimizing losses from liquidations and bad debt. \n\n*Note: As a general guideline, we limit the proposed changes by +-3% for all parameters as a high/low bound for a given proposal. This ensures more controlled changes and allows us to analyze their effect on user behavior before recommending further amendments to the parameters if the optimal configuration is outside this range.*\n\nPlease find more information on the parameter recommendation methodology [here](https://community.chaoslabs.xyz/aave/recommendations/methodology).\n\nYou can also view the simulation results and breakdown for the different assets by clicking on them on this [page](https://community.chaoslabs.xyz/aave/recommendations).\n\nThe output of our simulations reveals an opportunity to increase LTVs and LTs for WBTC and DAI on V3 Optimism, resulting in improved capital efficiency of the system, with no effect on the projected VaR (95th percentile of the protocol losses that will be accrued due to bad debt from under-collateralized accounts over 24 hours) and EVaR (Extreme VaR, the 99th percentile of the protocol losses that will be accrued due to bad debt from under-collateralized accounts over 24 hours)\n\n**Simulating all changes jointly yields a projected borrow increase of ~$155,000, with no increase in VaR and Extreme VaR compared to simulations with the current parameters.**\n\n \n![Untitled (30) (1).png](ipfs://bafkreifsuvfdgldiuwht446nposyfqsxkt5xatmfoh2xlqpfohsu6ozdne)\n\n \n![Untitled (31) (1).png](ipfs://bafkreif7g5o5w7coateogkysbd6sclmcbxbxqggbdkidd24bisuvzoasgi)\n    \n    \n\n### Liquidity Analysis:\n\nThe TVL in Aave on Optimism (118.71M$) is concentrated primarily on three blue-chip, high-liquidity assets, which together account for ~75% of the supplied assets in $ values: USDC (34%), WETH (28%), and WBTC (14%). Based on our analysis, we recommend increasing the Loan-To-Value (LTV) and Liquidation Threshold (LT) for WBTC and DAI, as we have determined that there is adequate on-chain liquidity to support significant liquidations. Similarly, we recommend reducing the Liquidation Penalty for WBTC, which is set conservatively at 10% to a lower level (8.5%) closer to that of USDC and Ethereum (5%).\n\n### Positions Analysis\n\nWe have not identified any outsized positions that are actively affecting our recommendations. However, we should call out that  ~40% of the on-chain supply of WBTC on Optimism is currently held on Aave, which calls for some caution. We have already proposed and implemented an [amendment to the supply cap](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-chaos-labs-supply-and-borrow-cap-updates-aave-v3-2023-02-24/12048/4) to limit the concentration of liquidity on Aave.\n\nGiven the blue-chip nature of BTC/WBTC, we expect significant arbitrage buying pressure to offset any slippage that may be created by future liquidations of WBTC and, therefore, recommend reducing the Liquidation Penalty even with the current significant liquidity concentration on Aave. We expect a lower LP to drive liquidators to liquidate positions in smaller portions, pacing the process and allowing the market more time to react. \n\n### Recommendations\n\n| Asset | Parameter | Current | Rec | Change |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| WBTC | Liquidation Threshold | 75% | 78% | +3% |\n| WBTC | Loan-to-Value | 70% | 73% | +3% |\n| WBTC | Liquidation Penalty | 10% | 8.5% | -1.5% |\n| DAI | Liquidation Threshold | 80% | 83% | +3% |\n| DAI | Loan-to-Value | 75% | 78% | +3% |",

        "body": "## Simple Summary\n\nA proposal to adjust four (4) total risk parameters, including Loan-to-Value and Liquidation Threshold, across two (2) Aave V3 Ethereum assets.\n\n## Motivation\n\nAave V3 Ethereum was launched successfully on January 27th, 2023, with a conservative configuration for the initial assets, as [recommended](https://governance.aave.com/t/chaos-labs-aave-v3-ethereum-initial-parameters/11159) by Chaos Labs.\n\nFollowing the successful launch and after analyzing the initial supply and borrow distribution and general usage across the deployment, we propose incrementally increasing the LTs and LTVs for USDC and DAI with the following goals:\n\n1. Provide a sustainable set of parameters that are better optimized for risk-reward in the long term.\n2. Serve as a catalyst to promote migration of funds from V2 to V3, as capital efficiency under the current parameter settings is significantly inferior to V2.\n\n*Note: As a general guideline, we limit our proposed changes by ±3% for all parameters as a high/low bound for a given proposal. This ensures more controlled changes and allows us to analyze their effect on user behavior before recommending further amendments to the parameters if the optimal configuration is outside this range.*\n\nIt is important to note that V3 Ethereum still needs to be integrated into our parameter recommendation platform, and therefore the recommendations provided here are not simulation-based. However, from running our simulations on similar assets on Arbitrum and Avalanche and considering the differences between the deployments, we conclude that the provided parameters are still conservative and can be further increased toward an optimized state in future iterations.\n\n### Liquidity and Position Analysis:\n\n**USDC**\n\nUSDC is mainly used as collateral for blue chip, high liquidity assets, most of which are WETH ($9M borrowed against USDC collateral) and recursive USDC borrowing. It is currently possible to liquidate USDC to cover all open USDC-WETH positions with very low slippage.\n\n \n![Screen Shot 2023-02-22 at 16.12.56.jpg](ipfs://bafkreid6lzxnhx7x2wbqlvjv3jo4wao5oybqa2iisoukfzddjjg36qem7y)\n*Source: [Chaos Risk Dashboard](https://community-staging.chaoslabs.xyz/aave/ccar/assets/USDC-Ethereum)*\n\n \n![Screen Shot 2023-02-22 at 16.18.02 (1).png](ipfs://bafkreie223fje7qt6xvubbe65qgalwnjdzlf4jjggyqhrsdi75rhznunky)\n*Source: [1inch](https://app.1inch.io/#/1/simple/swap/USDC/WETH)*\n\n**DAI**\n\nDAI is mainly used as collateral for blue chip, high liquidity assets, most of which are WETH ($340K borrowed against DAI collateral) and USDC ($240K borrowed against DAI collateral).
