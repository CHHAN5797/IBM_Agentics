        "body": "---\n\nTitle: [ARFC] Deployment of Aave on zkSync\nAuthor: ACI (Aave Chan Initiative)\nDate: 2024-06-10\n\n---\n\n# **Summary**\n\nThe current ARFC proposes deploying Aave V3 on zkSync to leverage the scalability and cost-efficiency of zk-Rollups. By integrating with zkSync, Aave can offer users faster and cheaper transactions while maintaining the security and decentralization of the Ethereum mainnet. This ARFC seeks governance approval for the deployment of an Aave V3 instance on the zkSync Era L2.\n\n## Motivation\n\nzkSync is a Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum that utilizes zk-Rollups to batch multiple transactions off-chain and submit a single proof to the Ethereum mainnet. This approach significantly enhances transaction throughput and reduces gas fees. Deposit and borrowing activities can greatly benefit from the reduced transaction costs and increased throughput offered by zkSync.\n\n### Benefits of deploying to zkSync\n\n1. **Reduce Gas Fees:** By leveraging zkSync’s efficient transaction processing, users will incur significantly lower gas fees.\n2. **Scalability:** zkSync’s high throughput will allow Aave to scale effectively, accommodating more users and transactions without compromising performance.\n3. **New Frontier & Opportunities:** This deployment will offer the Aave DAO a new frontier for growth to explore and a new avenue path for GHO, our stablecoin.\n4. **Interoperability:** Due to zkSync infrastructure, an Aave V3 deployment in the zkSync Era can benefit other Aave family products, such as Lens on a segregated layer with GHO, making it a mutually beneficial relationship.\n\n## Specification\n\n### Proof of Liquidity (POL) and Deposit Commitments\n1. Aave DAO commits to redistribute to Aave users via liquidity mining, GHO secondary liquidity incentives, safety module deployments, or merit programs any airdrop provided by the zkSync ecosystem.\n2. ACI, on behalf of the Aave DAO, will coordinate any liquidity mining campaign on a zkSync Aave V3 deployment.\n\n### Risk Parameters\n\n> This section has been updated after @ChaosLabs & @LlamaRisk feedback\n\nAfter Risk Service Providers feedback, the following Risk Parameters will be applied to the following assets:\n\n|  | USDC | USDT | WETH | wstETH |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Isolation Mode | NO | NO | NO | NO |\n| Enable Borrow | YES | YES | YES | YES |\n| Enable Collateral | YES | YES | YES | YES |\n| Emode Category | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A |\n| Loan To Value | 75% | 75% | 75% | 71% |\n| Liquidation Threshold | 78% | 78% | 78% | 76% |\n| Liquidation Bonus | 5% | 5% | 6% | 7% |\n| Reserve Factor | 10% | 10% | 15% | 15% |\n| Liquidation Protocol Fee | 10% | 10% | 10% | 10% |\n| Borrow Cap | 900,000 | 2,700,000 | 800 | 50 |\n| Supply Cap | 1,000,000 | 3,000,000 | 1,000 | 500 |\n| Debt Ceiling | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A |\n| uOptimal | 90% | 90% | 80% | 45% |\n| Base | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% |\n| Slope1 | 9% | 9% | 3.3% | 4.5% |\n| Slope2 | 75% | 75% | 80% | 80% |\n| Stable Borrowing | Disabled | Disabled | Disabled | Disabled |\n| Flashloanable | YES | YES | YES | YES |\n| Siloed Borrowing | NO | NO | NO | NO |\n| Borrowable in Isolation | YES | YES | NO | NO |\n\n### Useful Links\n\n- [zkSync Official Site](https://zksync.io/)\n- [zkSync Portal Bridge](https://portal.zksync.io/bridge/)\n- [zkSync Documentation](https://docs.zksync.io/build/quick-start)\n\n## Next Steps\n1. If consensus is reached on this ARFC, escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n2. If the ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, coordinate with BGDLabs and Catapulta service providers for an Aave V3 instance deployment on zkSync Era.\n\n## Disclaimer\nThis proposal is powered by Skywards.

This onboarding will allow Aave users to supply and borrow SCR, thereby enhancing the utility and liquidity of the Scroll token within the DeFi ecosystem and more specifically, within the Aave ecosystem.\n\n### **Motivation/Background:**\n\nScroll is an Ethereum Layer 2 chain which already has an Aave instance deployment and SCR is the governance token for the Scroll L2. By onboarding SCR to Aave V3, we aim to create new opportunities for Aave users to engage with this emerging staking ecosystem, while expanding SCR’s liquidity.\n\n**Benefits of listing this token:**\n\nProvide opportunities for Aave users to borrow against their SCR to unlock liquidity, or alternatively to borrow SCR against other collateral allowing them to participate in Scroll governance.\n\n**Market Impact:**\n\nWe see no significant market impact from onboarding SCR except for providing new opportunities to Aave users which may cause users to switch from borrowing other tokens against their collateral. Overall we see onboarding SCR as net good for Aave users as it expands opportunities for them to engage in a new L2 ecosystem.\n\n**Chain to be deployed/listed:**\n\nScroll.\n\n**Proof of Liquidity (POL) and Deposit Commitments:**\n\nPOL and Deposit Commitments will be discussed at the ARFC stage. \n\nAs disclosed by Marc Zeller, founder of ACI, the ACI Multisig has received 510K SCR on behalf of Aave DAO. Those funds will be coordinated with Karpatkey and Tokenlogic to define best usage of this airdrop. \n\n### **Specification**\n\nRisk Parameters have been provided by Risk Service Providers on 2024-11-25\n\n| Parameter | Value |\n| --- | --- |\n| Network | Scroll |\n| Isolation Mode | N/A |\n| Borrowable | Yes |\n| Collateral Enabled | No |\n| Supply Cap | 360,000 |\n| Borrow Cap | 180,000 |\n| Debt Ceiling | - |\n| LTV | - |\n| LT | - |\n| Liquidation Bonus | - |\n| Liquidation Protocol Fee | - |\n| Variable Base | 0.0% |\n| Variable Slope1 | 7.00% |\n| Variable Slope2 | 300.0% |\n| Uoptimal | 45.00% |\n| Reserve Factor | 20.00% |\n| Stable Borrowing | Disabled |\n| Flashloanable | Yes |\n| Siloed Borrowing | No |\n| Borrowable in Isolation | No |\n| E-Mode Category | N/A |\n\n### **Useful Links:**\n\n- [Scroll website](https://scroll.io/)\n- [Scroll docs](https://docs.scroll.io/en/home/)\n- [[TEMP CHECK]Onboard SCR to Aave V3 Scroll Instance](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-onboard-scr-to-aave-v3-scroll-instance/19568)\n- [[TEMP CHECK Snapshot] Onboard SCR to Aave V3 Scroll Instance](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0x900027a0dc30946b463ce8e57a8901b5fc1158546b4d00acae4d2d823d8de732)\n\n### **Disclaimer:**\n\nThis proposal is powered by Skywards.

This ARFC proposal suggests that Aave supports Lido Alliance efforts by deploying a new Aave V3 ETH market for Lido. This Aave v3 instance will be designed and tuned to support stETH leverage loopers. The deployment will only include wstETH and wETH assets with E-Mode enabled.\n\nLido has committed incentive programs and ecosystem support for this instance in order to bootstrap liquidity and promote additional programs within the Lido Alliance.\n\nThis market will be bootstrapped with wETH from the Ahab program to attract wETH liquidity.\n\nwETH suppliers will also be proposed to be eligible to a dedicated Merit Boost\n\nIncentives from Lido will be detailed ahead of the AIP deployment. \n\n## Specification\n\nThe Lido Alliance’s Aave v3 instance implements the following:\n\n- The borrow cap of wETH will be set to 90% of supplied wETH, with updates tightly controlled by the risk steward. This will ensure that stETH/wETH loops are consistently profitable and can't go into negative territory.\n- E-Mode LTV & LT are set 50 bps above all other Aave implementations, making it the most efficient loop venue in the industry.\n- For the first 6 months of the Lido Alliance Aave v3, wETH slope1 will be set at 2.50%, ((currently 2.7% on mainnet and on L2s) and wETH RF set at 10% (currently 15% on all markets). This will make it the most profitable venue to loop stETH & wETH.\n- wstETH RF will be 5%.\n\nThe deployment of the Aave V3 Lido Ecosystem Aave will be done by Catapulta on behalf of the Aave DAO.\n\n|Parameter|wstETH value|wETH value|\n|---|---|---|\n|Isolation Mode|No|No|\n|Borrowable|Yes|Yes|\n|Collateral Enabled|Yes|Yes|\n|Supply Cap|650K|900K|\n|Borrow Cap|12k|810K|\n|Debt Ceiling|NA|NA|\n|LTV|80.00%|82.00%|\n|LT|81.00%|83.00%|\n|Liquidation Bonus|6%|5%|\n|Liquidation Protocol Fee|10.00%|10.00%|\n|Variable Base|0.0%|0.0%|\n|Variable Slope1|3.5%|2.50%|\n|Variable Slope2|85%|85%|\n|Uoptimal|45%|90%|\n|Reserve Factor|5.00%|10%|\n|Stable Borrowing|Disabled|Disabled|\n|Flahloanable|Yes|Yes|\n|Siloed Borrowing|No|No|\n|Borrowed in Isolation|No|No|\n|E-Mode|Yes|Yes|\n|E-Mode LTV|93.5%|93.5%|\n|E-Mode LT|95.5%|95.5%|\n|E-mode Liquidation Bonus|1%|1 %|\n\n## **Useful Links:**\n\nLido Alliance proposal: https://research.lido.fi/t/lido-alliance-an-ethereum-aligned-ecosystem/7475\n\n https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-deploy-a-lido-aave-v3-instance/17930\n\n## Disclaimer:\n\nThe Aave Chan Initiative is not directly affiliated with Lido and did not receive compensation for creating this proposal. The ACI and its employees hold stETH.\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. If the ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, publish an AIP vote for final deployment and enforcement of the proposal.\n2. Work with service providers and Lido Alliance to release and promote the new Aave v3 instance. \n\n## Copyright:\n\nCopyright and related rights waived under [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

As weETH has already been approved for onboarding to Aave V3 on Ethereum, Arbitrum, and Base by the DAO, this proposal extends the onboarding of weETH to Aave v3 on Scroll.\n\n## **Proof of Liquidity and Deposit Commitments:**\n\nweETH deposits into Aave on Scroll will accumulate [ether.fi](http://ether.fi/) and EigenLayer points and Scroll Marks.\n\n## **Specification:**\n\nweETH on Scroll: [0x01f0a31698c4d065659b9bdc21b3610292a1c506](https://scrollscan.com/address/0x01f0a31698c4d065659b9bdc21b3610292a1c506)\n\nweETH/ETH Chainlink Feed: [0x57bd9E614f542fB3d6FeF2B744f3B813f0cc1258](https://scrollscan.com/address/0x57bd9E614f542fB3d6FeF2B744f3B813f0cc1258)\n\nRisk Parameters will be provided by Risk Service Providers and the ARFC will be updated following their feedback.\n\n|Parameter|Value|\n|---|---|\n|Isolation Mode|No|\n|Borrowable|Yes|\n|Collateral Enabled|Yes|\n|Supply Cap (weETH)|2,000|\n|Borrow Cap (weETH)|400|\n|Debt Ceiling|-|\n|LTV|72.50%|\n|LT|75.00%|\n|Liquidation Bonus|7.50%|\n|Liquidation Protocol Fee|10.00%|\n|Variable Base|0.0%|\n|Variable Slope1|7.00%|\n|Variable Slope2|300.00%|\n|Uoptimal|45.00%|\n|Reserve Factor|15.00%|\n|Stable Borrowing|Disabled|\n|Flashloanable|Yes|\n|Siloed Borrowing|No|\n|Borrowed in Isolation|No|\n|E-Mode Category|ETH-correlated|\n\n\n## **Useful Links**\n\n[Ether.fi](https://www.ether.fi/)\n\n[weETH Base onboarding](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-onboarding-of-weeth-to-aave-v3-on-base/17691)\n\n[weETH Arbitrum onboarding](https://vote.onaave.com/proposal/?proposalId=76&ipfsHash=0x78778591515790b337fcdcc2a02d49dc58e98cad614c33d61e1173bc6194729d)\n\n[weETH Onboarding](https://vote.onaave.com/proposal/?proposalId=74&ipfsHash=0x227ef8b0f49775f64100ec697bc4e67b0739bd1ff08788b1f6b48a66e1d57bf7)\n\n## **Disclaimer**\n\nThis proposal is powered by Skywards.

        "body": "## Author: ACI (Aave Chan Initiative)\n\n## Date: 2024-11-25\n\n---\n\n## Summary\n\n> Risk Parameters have been provided by Risk Services Providers and ARFC has been updated with that feedback 2024-12-03\n\n# Summary\n\nThe proposal aims to onboard Ignition's FBTC, to the Aave v3 protocol Main Market on Ethereum.\n\n# Motivation\n\nFBTC is a cross-chain BTC protocol that uses the Threshold Signature Scheme network to enable secure, decentralized Bitcoin scalability across multiple blockchains. By leveraging multi-party computation, FBTC strengthens bridge security, safeguarding user assets and ensuring robust cross-chain interoperability. This setup also integrates a cross-chain hub, allowing seamless BTC transfers while reducing issues linked to Bitcoin L2 growth.\n\nThis new asset will broaden opportunities for Bitcoin holders aiming to participate in DeFi on Aave v3. The introduction of FBTC offers users more flexibility in leveraging their Bitcoin, enhancing liquidity and driving increased engagement within the Aave protocol.\n\nWith $480M in total value locked (TVL), FBTC is emerging as a compelling solution in Bitcoin bridging, supported by its upcoming Chainlink Oracle integration to accelerate growth across EVM networks.\n\nAave is positioned to benefit from a material increase in AUM resulting from FBTC deposits. This capital is being sourced by from within the Ignition team's network. Several sophisticated investors are looking to user Aave at size and some teams have built products specifical for investors in anticipationg of the Aave listing. The Ignition team is expected to provide incentives supporting Aave users directly and also strategy providers built on top of Aave. @TokenLogic has been coordinating with various prospective users to ensure there is adequate demand ahead of the listing.\n\n### Benefits of listing FBTC\n\nWith the evolving landscape surrounding wBTC, having alternative wrapped BTC tokens available for use on Aave is crucial. With Antalpha and Mantle serving as core contributors, Ignition strong reputations position this initiative as a credible alternative to wBTC. This collaborative effort has already garnered over $850 million in TVL.\n\nThe cbBTC listing has demonstrated how impactful an Aave integration can be for both parties involved. Aave successfully captured 74% of the cbBTC supply, showcasing the significant growth potential and mutual benefits such integrations can bring.\n\n### Liquidity commitments\n\nFBTC current points campaign is focused on maximizing user engagement and incentivizing interactions within the DeFi ecosystem. As part of this initiative, they aim to highlight Aave by listing it in the featured section, providing prominent exposure to its offerings. Additionally, they plan to create a new DeFi lending category, with Aave being the inaugural protocol, further showcasing its significance in this space.\n\nTo enhance user participation, they will introduce boosted points under the Sparks program, with Aave receiving 2x-4x sparks by default; double the rewards compared to other protocols, which offer 1x-2x.\n\nFor a limited period, it will further amplify rewards by offering a 4x-8x sparks boost on Aave V3 instance, driving even greater engagement and usage.\n\n# Specification\n\nTicker: FBTC\n\nContract address on mainnet: `0xC96dE26018A54D51c097160568752c4E3BD6C364`\n\nChainlink oracle: `0xe5346a4Fd329768A99455d969724768a00CA63FB`\n\nProject: https://fbtc.com/\n\nReserves addresses: https://docs.fbtc.com/security/bitcoin-reserve-address\n\nProof of Assets dashboard: https://fbtc.com/proof-of-assets\n\nGitHub: https://github.com/fbtc-xyz/fbtc-contract\n\nDocs: https://docs.fbtc.com/\n\nAudit: https://github.com/fbtc-xyz/fbtc-contract/tree/main/audits\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/IgnitionFBTC\n\n| Parameter | Value |\n| --- | --- |\n| Network | Ethereum |\n| Isolation Mode | No |\n| Borrowable | Yes |\n| Collateral Enabled | Yes |\n| Supply Cap | 200 |\n| Borrow Cap | 100 |\n| Debt Ceiling | - |\n| LTV | 73.00% |\n| LT | 78.00% |\n| Liquidation Bonus | 7.50% |\n| Liquidation Protocol Fee | 10% |\n| Variable Base | 0.0% |\n| Variable Slope1 | 4.0% |\n| Variable Slope2 | 300% |\n| Uoptimal | 45% |\n| Reserve Factor | 50% |\n| Stable Borrowing | Disabled |\n| Flashloanable | Yes |\n| Siloed Borrowing | No |\n| Borrowable in Isolation | No |\n| E-Mode Category | N/A |\n\n> Risk Parameters have been provided by Risk Services Providers and ARFC has been updated with that feedback 2024-12-03\n\n# Disclosure\n\nThe ACI is not directly affiliated with Ignition and did not receive compensation for creation this proposal.\n\n# Next Steps\n\n1.
