        "body": "## Simple Summary\n\nA proposal to reduce Liquidation Threshold (LT) and Loan-To-Value (LTV), for CRV on Aave V2 Ethereum.\n\n## Motivation\n\nFollowing our recommendations to decrease Aaveâ€™s exposure to CRV on V2 Ethereum [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/gauntlet-recommendation-to-freeze-crv-and-set-crv-ltv-0-on-aave-v2/13644/31), we propose a series of LT and LTV reductions.\n\nAs Liquidation Threshold reductions may lead to user accounts being eligible for liquidations upon their approval, we want to clarify the full implications to the community at each step. To best minimize this impact, we suggest reaching the desired settings by **a series of incremental decreases**, following the [Risk-Off Framework](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/bafkreigdmcfmwvnxfolpds4xkdicgrszgmknig7pz2r2t37tltupdpyfu4) previously approved by the community, with a reduction of up to 3% in any given AIP. In an attempt to avoid liquidations, Chaos Labs will publicly communicate the planned amendments and list of affected accounts leading to the on-chain execution.\n\nIn the graph below, we share data to quantify and visualize the effect of the recommended reductions on protocol users. For the proposed, 3% LT decrease, the impact on users at the time of this post is negligible (2 accounts liquidated, ~3$ liquidated).\n\n![CRV (1)|600x371](upload://tHX5xvHscvxnCa5Bb5KfLENt1HG.png)\n\n\n|Liquidation Treshold| Accounts Liquidated | Liquidation Value |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|55| 2 | ~$3 |\n\n## Specification\n\n| Asset | Parameter | Current Value | Recommendation |Change |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |--- |\n| CRV | LT | 58 | 55 |-3% |\n| CRV | LTV | 52 | 49 |-3% |\n\n## Next Steps\n\n2. If consensus is reached, submit an Aave Improvement Proposal (AIP) to implement the proposed updates.\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

In addition, these changes will act as an effective motivation to shift usage to V3, where users can enjoy the benefits of enhanced risk mitigation mechanisms.\n\nAs Liquidation Threshold reductions may lead to user accounts being eligible for liquidations upon their approval, we want to clarify the full implications to the community at each step. To minimize this impact, we suggest reaching the desired settings byÂ **a series of incremental decreases**, following theÂ [Risk-Off Framework](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/bafkreigdmcfmwvnxfolpds4xkdicgrszgmknig7pz2r2t37tltupdpyfu4)Â previously approved by the community, with a reduction of up to 3% in any given AIP.\n\nTo avoid liquidations, Chaos Labs will communicate the planned amendments before their on-chain execution via all available avenues (Twitter, forums,Â [Nansen Connect](https://connect.nansen.ai/), andÂ [Blockscan Chat](https://chat.blockscan.com/)).\n\nBelow, we share data to quantify the effect of the recommended reductions on protocol users.\n\nAt the time of this proposal, none of the current positions will be eligible for liquidation due to the proposed change.\n\n**$MKR**\n- Zero (0) accounts are eligible for liquidation.\n\n## Recommendation\n\n|Asset|Parameter|Current| Rec.|Change|\n|---| --- | ---| --- | ---  |\n| MKR | Liquidation Threshold |67%| 64%| -3% |\n| MKR | Loan-to-Value | 62%| 59%| -3%|",

        "body": "## Simple Summary\nA proposal to adjust eight ( 8) total risk parameters, including Liquidation Threshold (LT) and Loan-To-Value (LTV), for four (4) assets on Aave V2 Ethereum.\n\n## Abstract\nFollowing recent market events, the AAVE community has decided to reduce the risk profile across many higher volatile assets by disabling borrow or freezing across v2 markets ([AIP-121](https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/121/), [AIP-124](https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/124/), and [AIP-125](https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/125/))\n\nAfter mitigating the immediate risk to the protocol with the above AIPs, Chaos Labs is exploring the impact and trade-offs of decreasing the Liquidation Thresholds and LTVs of long-tail assets on Ethereum v2 (ENS, MKR, SNX, and CRV).\n\nThis proposal is the second in a [series of proposals](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-risk-parameter-updates-for-aave-v2-ethereum-lt-and-ltv-2022-12-01/10897) intended to reduce the viability of different attack vectors on v2 assets.\n\n## Motivation\nCapital efficiency reductions on v2 assets will further mitigate attack vectors, in part by increasing the capital required to wage a price manipulation attack on Aave. In addition, these changes will act as an effective motivation to shift usage to v3, where users can enjoy the benefits of E-mode with enhanced risk techniques and mitigation methodologies.\n\nAs Liquidation Threshold reductions may lead to user accounts being eligible for liquidations upon their approval, we want to clarify the full implications to the community at each step. To best minimize this impact, we suggest reaching the desired settings by a series of incremental decreases, following the [Risk-Off Framework](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/bafkreigdmcfmwvnxfolpds4xkdicgrszgmknig7pz2r2t37tltupdpyfu4) previously approved by the community, with a reduction of up to 3% in any given AIP. In an attempt to avoid liquidations, Chaos Labs will communicate the planned amendments 7 days before their on-chain execution via all available avenues (Twitter, forums, Nansen Connect, and Blockscan Chat).\n\nIn the graphs below, we share data to quantify and visualize the effect of the recommended reductions on protocol users for community discussion.\n\nMainnet snapshot captured on December 4th, 2022, 16:30 GMT\n## CRV\n \n![Untitled (4) (1).png](ipfs://bafkreiftomsg4ucgq7agu6zjw7pfwwhg2u5nmeey2vwtste3qa4y376wkm)\n    \n## MKR\n \n![Untitled (5) (1).png](ipfs://bafkreietyanzm7dze2asldgw7w52cqjjkdstwwtuyv426ffuyr6wucxkti)\n    \n## SNX\n \n![Untitled (6) (1).png](ipfs://bafkreie55jwuybptqvjghrxctp6bymjl4oavkfvtkdsy42ah4iypdnpg6q)\n    \n## ENS\n- Zero (0) liquidations for up to an 8% reduction.\n## Joint Reduction of $MKR, $CRV, $SNX and $ENS\n- Reducing LTs jointly for the above long tail assets by 3% results in less than 6K USD worth of liquidations\n \n![Untitled (7) (1).png](ipfs://bafkreiczlhq32rrj7fjbs66gv4v52twb7ghezkp4em6pg5k5oy6ge3fl54)\n## Joint Reductions with $USDC and $DAI\n- The assets can also be reduced jointly with the suggested [USDC, DAI change](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-risk-parameter-updates-for-aave-v2-ethereum-lt-and-ltv-2022-12-01/10897) without causing additional liquidations.\n\n## Recommendation\n \n![Screen Shot 2022-12-05 at 2.13.57 PM.png](ipfs://bafkreif72fcajvopiooewsizhljqusudsa7rzu6tdxq6oryef6tjeezloq)",
