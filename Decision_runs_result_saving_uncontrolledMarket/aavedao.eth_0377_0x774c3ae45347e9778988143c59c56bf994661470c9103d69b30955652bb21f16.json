        "body": "**Title:** [TEMP CHECK] Updated Aave Grants Continuation Proposal\n\n**Author:** Bill & @0xmigi\n\n**Date:** 09-25-2023\n\n---\n\nThank you to everyone who participated in the TEMP CHECK: Continue Aave Grants Proposal. This is an updated proposal based on the feedback that was received. The main changes that has been made from the previous proposal are:\n\n* The Events & Sponsorship budget and activities have been removed.\n* Swapping the AAVE portion of funding with stables.\n* Introducing a $20k max grant size.\n\n# Summary\n\nAn opportunity to continue Aave Grants DAO (AGD) for 6 months by preserving the current AGD treasury holdings, providing $400,000 of new funding in ARB, and increasing AGD’s stablecoin allowance by $328,000.\n\nThis proposal will enable AGD to deliver and improve upon the top tier grants program the Aave ecosystem has had over the past 2+ years and continue being a gateway for new contributors to the ecosystem. AGD will fund $500,000 in developer grants per quarter, drive Aave’s culture and GHO adoption, and set the groundwork for the next chapter of the continued evolution of AGD.\n\n# Overview\n\nThroughout the previous proposal, AGD has:\n\n* Awarded 50 new grants and made 15 payments to grantees based on milestone completion.\n\n* Engaged builders and the community at five events, including four hackathons where AGD awarded a total of 19 Aave and GHO specific bounties and inspired 58 teams to hack with Aave and GHO.\n\n* Proliferated the ghost by hosting 1 rAAVE to strengthen Aave’s culture, bring the community together, and cultivate an ecosystem with the best contributors.\n\n* Exercised prudence with the treasury by decreasing the average grant size awarded by 52.8% and maintaining average reviewer compensation at ~22% of the monthly maximum budget.\n\nThis proposal outlines renewing AGD for the next 6 months by:\n\n* Providing new funding of $400,000 in ARB (~18% of the total ARB received by Aave DAO)\n\n* Increasing AGD’s stablecoin allowance by $328,000.\n\n# History\n\n![Timeline|1280x490](upload://8UmNLA3q2rDe51LE1bpp2iCpUOh.jpeg)\n\nSince its inception in May 2021, AGD has awarded $4,852,753 across 249 grants.\n\nFrom the last AGD proposal in January 2023 to now, AGD has awarded 50 grants and awarded 19 Aave and GHO specific bounties across four different hackathons.\n\n*Note: All $ cost amounts are calculated at time of payment, pre/post token value fluctuations are not included unless otherwise specified. Pending payments are not included.\n\nThis is the fifth proposal for AGD:\n\n* The[ initial proposal](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-aave-community-grants-program/3642) launched AGD in May 2021 with $1 million of total funding over two quarters.\n\n* The[ second proposal](https://governance.aave.com/t/aave-grants-update-and-renewal/6371) was executed at the end of December 2021 and funded AGD for three months with $2 million of funding.\n\n* The[ third proposal](https://governance.aave.com/t/aave-grants-dao-update-and-renewal/7842) was executed at the end of May 2022 and funded AGD for six months with $3 million per quarter.\n\n* The[ fourth proposal](https://governance.aave.com/t/updated-proposal-aave-grants-dao-renewal/11289) was executed at the end of January 2023 and funded AGD for six months with $1.625 million per quarter.\n\n# Mission\n\nAGD is a community-led grants program that supports the growth of the Aave ecosystem by:\n\n(1) Funding innovative projects backed by strong teams with creative ideas that benefit and strengthen the Aave ecosystem through products and initiatives which:\n\n* Increase TVL or other protocol metrics\n\n* Expand the capabilities of the platform and utility of Aave\n\n* Empower the community with accessible and novel insights\n\n* Engage new users and enhance retention of current users\n\n* Grow GHO by stimulating demand, expanding its utility, and accelerating its transactional velocity\n\nAND\n\n(2) Fostering a strong and inclusive culture around Aave. Aave's culture leads to:\n\n* Attracting and retaining the best contributors, and\n\n* Encouraging the development of new and creative solutions to key areas in the Aave protocol and Aave DAO.\n\n# Metrics\n\n**Grants Provided:**\n\n* Since May 2021: 249 grants worth $4,845,753\n\n* Since Jan 2023: 50 grants worth $885,020\n\n* Breakdown of grants by category:\n\n  * Category - $cumulative cost - number approved\n\n  * Applications and integrations - $2,664,556 - 108 grants\n\n  * Code audits - $82,000 - 3 grants\n\n  * Committees & DAOs that serve Aave’s ecosystem - $703,780 - 18 grants\n\n  * Community (marketing and educational) - $698,550 - 52 grants\n\n  * Developer tooling - $415,000 - 13 grants\n\n  * Events / Hackathons / Sponsorships - $185,000 - 14 grants\n\n  * Other - $294,900 - 12 grants\n\n  * Protocol development - $474,200 - 21 grants\n\n**Status of all Grant Projects Awarded:**\n\n* Complete/Live - 67.6%\n\n* In-progress - 24.8%\n\n* Inactive - 7.6%\n\n**Growth in Community Engagement Since Last Renewal Proposal (Jan 2023):**\n\n* Substack subscribers: 1,748 → 1,805 (+ 3%)\n\n* Twitter followers: 13,300 → 13,400 (+ 0.75%)\n\n* Telegram members: 643 → 719 (+ 12%)\n\n* Lens followers: 2,828 → 8,801 (+ 211%)\n\n* Mirror subscribers: 169 → 546 (+ 223%)\n\n**Key Stats Since Inception:**\n\n* Participated in 14 hackathons, awarding $150,000 in Aave and GHO specific bounties to 58 teams.\n\n  * Many of these teams have continued building or contributing to Aave and GHO, including five projects that went on to receive grants.\n\n* Achieved a Net Promoter Score, a measurement to gauge the experience of grantees, of 83 based on 77 responses.\n\n  * Average response to “How likely are you to recommend AGD?” is 4.8/5.\n\n* Processed 1,944 applications with an average turnaround time from application submission to grant decision of 9.6 days, shrinking over time.\n\n* Consistently accepted applications and awarded grants to builders:\n\n![AGD Proposal Received Since Inception - As of Sept 4 2023|2000x368](upload://n03ZA93GH9RxzfcLaBSYBdBnLoX.jpeg)\n\n![Grants accepted by quarter - As of Sept 4 2023|2000x371](upload://za6UB8Bgrv5fm25iKl2Zb0ePqZw.jpeg)\n\n# Since the Last Proposal\n\nThe community has been kept up to date with AGD’s[ activity in @0xmigi’s monthly governance updates](https://governance.aave.com/t/agd-renewal-4-recent-work-updates/11585), the[ Halfway Update](https://governance.aave.com/t/agd-renewal-4-april-2023-halfway-updates/13683), and through AGD being added to[ Llama’s treasury dashboard](https://community.llama.xyz/aave/grants). The [AGD website](https://aavegrants.org/) houses a running list since inception of grants awarded, event and sponsorship spend and other information.\n\nThe GHO release was an exciting launch for the Aave community and was a prioritized focus throughout AGD’s last proposal. AGD began to spread awareness about GHO’s launch and encouraged early development with GHO across the four hackathons that were sponsored. AGD also funded multiple GHO related grants and supported development with the introduction of ‘Request for Grants’, inviting projects that help to stimulate GHO’s demand and increase its utility to apply for a grant.\n\n## AGD Budget\n\nAGD has exercised prudence with the treasury, while continuing to fund high quality builders and drive growth and experimentation in the Aave ecosystem. The current AGD treasury, including token allowances and OP, is roughly $1,450,895. Part of the reduced spend is because of a reduction in the average size of grants awarded. The average grant size awarded so far in 2023 is 52.8% lower than the average grant size awarded during 2022, currently at $13,936.\n\n![Average Grant Size Over Time.png|1606x984](upload://A28z92ug5DZZaQFNkv39J3DBzU5.jpeg)\n\nHere is a breakdown of AGD’s spend versus what was budgeted:\n\n![Budgeted vs Spent|1280x395](upload://yxP25hD2WEZRrNTbH6wYOefQMG1.jpeg)\n\nHere is AGD’s spend over the course of the previous proposal:\n\n![Q6 & Q7 Breakdown|1280x485](upload://uwGvstmQoJAemBhNw11vhTndBLi.jpeg)\n\n## Other Initiatives\n\n* **Increasing Grantee Accountability.** There has been an influx in grantees (e.g. recently [Defi Simulator](https://governance.aave.com/t/introduction-defi-simulator/13166), [Projection Finance](https://governance.aave.com/t/introduction-blockchain-education-network-aave-tutorials-learning-content/14448), and [Aave Alarm](https://governance.aave.com/t/aave-mobile-notifier-app/14082)) posting directly on the forum to introduce themselves, explain their grant, and to keep the community updated as they progress. Most of these posts are the result of an initiative from AGD to better increase grantee accountability and engagement with the community.\n\n* **‘Requests for Grants’ (RFGs).** [A pilot project has been introduced](https://governance.aave.com/t/introducing-request-for-grants-by-aave-grants-dao-gho-governance-op/14125) to better direct builders to apply for grants in certain high impact areas. Going forward, AGD will look to expand the list of RFGs to target high impact areas and community needs by better communicating with different contributors and encouraging anyone to make suggestions.\n\n* **AGD Operations and Best Practices.** Over the last two years of operations, AGD’s values and best practices have been refined and adopted. It is a priority for AGD to clearly define and share these values and best practices with the community. Here is an overview of AGD’s current process:\n\n![Process|1280x466](upload://AbmHHvqATIWjmJubiH87yZgGKvX.jpeg)\n\n# Grantee Highlights\n\nSince AGD’s last proposal, 50 new grants have been awarded and 15 follow up milestone payments have been made. Of the 50 new grants awarded, 22 are complete, live or have reached notable milestones at the time of writing. Each grant has positively impacted different aspects of the Aave ecosystem.\n\n![Grants by Category|1280x856](upload://p42bwb2ZXMR7EZCIoR8rgS3v76B.jpeg)\n\nHere are some recent highlights from grantees:\n\n**[Dullahan](https://dullahan.paladin.vote/)**\n\nDesigned and launched a hub for GHO to drive adoption. Dullahan produces passive income for stkAAVE holders and provides GHO borrowers with access to reduced interest rates and has over 3,000 AAVE in deposits a few weeks after launch.\n\n**[Sommelier Finance](https://app.sommelier.finance/strategies/Real-Yield-ETH/manage)**\n\nEnables the creation of state-of-the-art DeFi strategies that leverage Aave V3 and GHO with the development and audit of a Aave V3 adaptor used by Sommelier strategies. As of July, their Aave V3 integration has allocated a net of $4M to Aave V3.\n\n**[AAVE based CIAN Strategies & Automation Tools](https://dapp.cian.app/strategy/maticleveraged/create)**\n\nExpands access to Aave V3 with open source vaults and advanced automation tooling, allowing strategists to generate strategies and users to easily access yield. As of August 2023, CIAN has generated $55M in TVL across Aave V2 and V3 on Polygon, Arbitrum, Ethereum Mainnet, Avalanche and Optimism via its leveraged staking strategies.\n\nOther applications include: [DeFi Simulator](https://defisim.xyz/), [Aave Alarm](https://github.com/nebolax/aavealarm), [Projection Finance](https://aavev3.projection.finance/) and [Karma HQ’s Delegate Dashboard](https://aave.karmahq.xyz/).\n\n**[IntoTheBlock Risk Radar for GHO](https://defirisk.intotheblock.com/metrics/ethereum/aave_gho)**\n\nHelps the community understand GHO's activity with 20 dedicated risk indicators including peg performance, collateral distribution and whale credit history.\n\n**[Xenophon Labs](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-raising-the-safety-module-s-slashing-percentage/14167)**\n\nPerformed an analysis on the Safety Module proposing an increase in the slashing percentage with the intent of saving the Aave protocol ~$2.1M per year\n\n**[Butter](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-incentivized-delegate-campaign-3-month/11732/19)**\n\nFacilitated an incentivized delegate initiative which kickstarted paying Aave delegates, encouraged participation in Aave governance from new community members and sparked TokenLogic to start their delegate platform.\n\n**[Senate](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0xb5da30d8d949c3f00f4a34cd68cdddba9e64dfaf47f75ab3bd8d164fcd001279)**\n\nReducing the friction of engaging with Aave governance by implementing their notification and alert system in the governance forum.\n\n**[Flexible aToken Voting](https://github.com/ScopeLift/flexible-voting/blob/master/src/ATokenFlexVoting.sol)** ScopeLift\n\nUnlocks the potential for new deposits by enabling protocols to allow users to retain voting power with tokens that are active in DeFi like Aave.\n\n**[AwesomeQA](https://home.awesomeqa.xyz/)**\n\nStreamlined the community support process with their Discord bot that automatically and quickly responds to user questions. In the past 3 months, the bot has answered over 55% of all questions, with 30% of those answers voted up by users indicating the response was very helpful.\n\n# Operational Focuses for this Proposal\n\nThe path to a decentralized and sustainable AGD is a long journey. Here are some initiatives planned for this proposal to continue working towards an effective and sustainable AGD:\n\n**Finish Establishing Legal Entity**\n\nEstablishing a legal entity allows AGD to begin operating more independently and with more protection and certainty for contributors by providing a legal structure for members and the ability to operate with the traditional financial world. As it currently exists, AGD is not able to even sign a contract. Transitioning to an entity is a big step for AGD’s maturity by providing clarity and protection to contributors, along with increasing operational effectiveness.\n\nAGD is currently finalizing the process of establishing a Cayman Foundation Company. The grants process will continue to operate as it does today and there will be no noticeable changes to AGD’s current processes or operations for the community.\n\n**Revamping Review Committee**\n\nAGD will update the processes and structure around the review committee. [One idea AGD will explore](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-further-decentralising-the-aave-grants-dao/14452/22) is introducing a rotating committee of community experts to serve short (3-6 months) time frames as grant reviewers. This will further involve the community in AGD while bringing expertise from different community members.\n\n**AGD and Service Provider Alignment**\n\nWith the increased number of Service Providers, there is a need to create better alignment between AGD and the work being done across the Aave DAO. Introducing simple activities like regular touch points would enable AGD to better (de)prioritize areas for grants based on feedback and insights from service providers. Where appropriate, AGD can also better work with service providers on helping to define the scope of related grants.\n\n**Measuring Impact**\n\nAGD aims to enhance the way it measures impact from grants by further developing internal resources and working with teams such as [Spindl](https://www.spindl.xyz/) to better track the impact effectiveness of grants.\n\nStarting with specific categories of grants like quests, AGD will better visualize activity driven by grants and gain insights into the effectiveness of different spend. Over time, AGD will extend similar tracking to other grant categories and impact metrics. This will enable the community to better track impact from grantees and empower AGD to make better review decisions.\n\n# People\n\nAGD now has ten members.\n\n* Lead. Bill oversees the growth of the team, the distribution of grants, and making sure AGD meets the strategic needs of Aave DAO.\n\n* Review Committee. The Review Committee is made up of:\n\n* Corbin Page - Paymagic, ex-ConsenSys\n\n* Calvin Chu - Impossible Finance\n\n* Francis Gowen - Flipside Crypto\n\n* Lawrence Mosley - Omni Analytics\n\n* Kakashi - Symphony\n\n* Andrew Allen - Coinbase\n\n* David Truong - [x23.ai](https://x23.ai/), ex-Aave Companies Genesis team dev\n\n* Operations Lead. Neil has streamlined the application process, manages payments, KYC, and other administrative tasks.\n\n* Analyst. Migi is the main touch point with current and future grantees. He finds opportunities where AGD can support grantees and track the returns generated. Migi also provides monthly updates on the governance forum.\n\n**Compensation:**\n\n* Lead: $9k/month\n\n* Review committee: $150/hr, capped at 10 hrs/week\n\n  * Reviewer pay per month has averaged $1,273/month per reviewer since May 2021. We will look to modify this as part of the overall revamp of the review committee.\n\n* Analyst: $5k/month\n\n* Operations lead: $150/hr capped at 20 hrs/month\n\n* Designer and other roles: one-off based on specific design engagements\n\nThe roles and compensation will be reviewed and iterated on in line with the focuses outlined above.\n\n# Proposed Budgets\n\nThis proposal's total budget will be split between a Grants Budget, an Events & Sponsorship Budget, and an Operations Budget. In total across all three budgets the total ask for the next 6 months is:\n\n* $400,000 in ARB\n\n* $328,000 increase in AGD’s stablecoin allowance\n\nThis would make AGD's treasury, including allowances 64.6% in stables, 11.5% in AAVE, and 23.9% in ARB & OP.\n\n$292,000 that was previously allocated to 'Digital Marketing' spend has been reallocated to this budget.\n\nNotably for the stablecoin portion of the treasury, AGD has started to explore further driving GHO adoption and grantee alignment by collaborating with @TokenLogic to [swap AGD's DAI allowance with GHO](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-treasury-management-replace-agd-s-dai-allowance-with-gho-allowance/14631). AGD will look to continue to do this with other stablecoin holdings in the future based on similar style governance proposals.\n\n## Grants Budget\n\n|                    \t| Carry Forward | Ask    \t| Tokens for Ask |\n|------------------------|---------------|------------|----------------|\n| Developer Grants   \t| $614,980  \t| $300,000   | Stables    \t|\n|                    \t| $133,000  \t| $0     \t| OP         \t|\n|                    \t| $0        \t| $400,000   | ARB        \t|\n| **Grants Total Budgeted Cost** | **$747,980**\t| **$700,000**   |            \t|\n\n\n\nThe OP is based on the 100,000 OP[ allocated to AGD during the previous proposal](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-allocation-of-300k-op-received-by-aave-grants-dao/12820). In line with the total amount of OP AGD has (300,000 OP), AGD is requesting $400,000 in ARB tokens to support the growth and development of projects building on top of Aave on Arbitrum. This is equivalent to ~18% of the total ARB received (at current prices) and is in line with the[ community’s preference](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0xea8b9cc41076ba43c8a66dfd40ce539b3126af049639babce6c1fa3e62585b79) to allocate the full amount of ARB received across multiple options. Any ARB unspent during this proposal will be kept in the AGD treasury and allocated to future proposals.\n\nAGD will introduce a new $20k max grant size for all grants and double down on kickstarting the growth of new teams building on top of Aave and GHO.\n\n## Operations Budget\n\n|                                             \t| Carry Forward | Ask   \t| Tokens for Ask |\n|-------------------------------------------------|---------------|-----------|----------------|\n| Compensation                                \t| $20,150   \t| $300,000  | Stables    \t|\n| Maintenance: Tooling, subscriptions, gas reimbursements | $526     \t| $20,000   | Stables    \t|\n| Legal Buffer                                \t| $69,984   \t| $0    \t|    \t|\n| **Operations Total Budgeted Cost**          \t| **$90,660**   | **$320,000** |            \t|\n\n\nIncreasing the overall amount allocated to operations, especially compensation, is necessary for AGD to grow its resources and operate more independently.\n\n\n# Next Steps\n\n* Get community feedback on TEMP CHECK\n\n* **Snapshot vote** <- we are here\n\n* If Snapshot is successful then move to AIP",

        "body": "---\n\ntitle: [TEMP CHECK] TokenLogic Proposal \nauthor: @TokenLogic\ncreated: 2023-08-25\n\n---\n\n# Summary\n\nThis publication present the Aave Community the opportunity to onboard TokenLogic as a service provider. TokenLogic shall focus on Aave DAO finances and support GHO adoption.\n\n\n# Introduction\n\nMembers of the TokenLogic team have been contributing to Aave Protocol since mid 2020. More recently, the team has been expanding in preparation to better support our three focus areas:\n\n* Treasury Management\n* Safety Module modelling\n* GHO Adoption\n\nTokenLogic is a developer focused team with a proven track recorded dating back to March 2023 when the delegation platform was annouced. During this time we have delivered the following:\n\n* 5 AIPs, 6 payloads, several GHO related BIPs\n* [GHO liquidity pools analysis](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-gho-liquidity-pools-primary-pools-initial-strategy/14071)\n* Coordinated [7.7%](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-gho-liquidity-pools-primary-pools-initial-strategy/14071) veBAL support for GHO's launch\n* Stoodup an analytics platform \n* Launch of [GHO Analytics frontend](https://governance.aave.com/t/tokenlogic-delegate-platform/12516)\n\nThe team is growing and we onboarded an accounting team to start developing a Aave Financial Reporting (genesis to date) frontend, launch date mid/late Q4 2023.\n\n# Current & Future Areas of Focus\n\n The below provides a high level overview of our **key focus** areas:\n\n* **Treasury Management**\n    * Improving the risk adjusted return of DAO's assets\n        * Aave v2 to v3 migrations\n        * Swap long tail assets to ETH / stable coins\n    * Improving capital efficiency\n        * Convert wMATIC to MaticX & stMATIC\n    * Managing strategic assets\n        * Upgrades to Strategic Asset Manager v1 functionality as required\n    * Modelling asset purchase / bribe\n        * Participate in Quest/Bribe v acquiring asset\n    * Engage, collaborate and support community lead initiatives\n        * Example: How best to optimise CRV holding\n    * Oversee Protocol Owned Liquidity (POL) deployment\n        * If DAO elects to provide POL, ensure Boost is directed to holding to optimise returns and maintain the strategy through claiming and swapping/locking rewards.\n    * Design and create a contract for managing DAO's POL\n        * Perform swaps, claim incentives, transfer assets etc...\n    * Claim Aave Protocol revenue fees at the end of each month\n        * This bot is currently operated by Llama\n\n* **GHO Liquidity / Incentives Management**\n    * Create Liquidity Management Committee / Budget\n        * Provide modelling to support Committee decision making\n    * Liquidity Incentive Optimisation Analysis (Strategic Assets)\n        * Target pool sizes & APRs \n    * Explore synergies with Safety Module diversification\n        * Potential to include GHO liquidity pools\n        * We will lead this effort after Llama's contract finishes\n* **Financial Reporting**\n    * Runway forecast\n        * Specifically tracking asset balance and drawdown rates to show when other assets require being swapped to fund the DAO\n    * Budget and resource allocation\n        * Work with ACI and others to develop a DAO budget\n    * Transparent accurate, third party reviewed, accessible financial statments\n        * Launch a financial statment frontend mid/late Q4 2023\n        * Cover Ethereum, Polygon (PoS), Arbitrum, Optimism and Avalanche initially and expand over time.\n        * Quarterly financial publications \n    * Revenue per Reserve v time charts\n        * Daily or Hourly data showing revenue being generated per Reserve on each Aave v2 and v3 iteration\n        * Users will be able to select an asset and see total revenue noiminated in the underlying or select an instance of Aave and a specific asset.\n        * Data will be displayed graphically with some ability to interact with the charts\n* **Supporting GHO Adoption**\n    * Collaborate with other teams to support GHO adoption\n        * Promote utility and velocity\n    * Continual development of GHO Analytics frontend\n    * Promote adoption through DeFi integrations\n        * Examples include working with teams to build real yield strategies, structured products and list GHO as collateral\n* **Safety Module Improvements**\n    * Model the SM performance during shortfall events\n        * Create a frontend that show historical performance for swapping certain amounts of each asset instantly (not dutch auction) via an aggregator\n    * Model / forecast emission budget\n        * AAVE emissions are finite, GHO is better\n        * Capital efficiency could be improved through adoption of quests and/or acquiring assets that control the emission schedule of another protocol\n    * Advocate for diversification and reducing the reward budget\n        * Introduction of stable coins, ETH and other assets to reduce reliance on AAVE during shortfall events\n    * Collaborate with others to refine to enhance the SM's effectiveness at providing a backstop for Aave Protocol\n        * BGD to implement on-chain upgrades\n        * Model liquidity pool assets to be added to SM\n        * Work with ACI, BGD, Llama and others to determine a target coverage, implementation of proposals and refine the asset blend\n\nEach of the areas detailed above is interwoven and has a material affect on the DAO's financial status. TokenLogic is committed to working with other DAO contributors collaboratively and constructively to better the Aave Protocol. \n\nTo support the initiatives aboves, we have created an analytics platform. The GHO dashboard is our first analytics initiative. Beyond GHO, we plan on using the analytics platform to provide the DAO with near live revenue data stream for each asset reserve on supported networks. We seek to always incorporate community feedback and build out any requests from the community.\n\nOur team is very well connected across defi and we intend to support Aave and GHO where ever we can. To this end, we are already working with several teams looking to integrate GHO and have been working with @0xbilll at AGD with targeted spending initiatives.\n\nTo ensure continuation of active work scopes, TokenLogic will continue to manage the migration of users on Polygon v2 to v3. This includes either fortnightly or monthly parameter adjustments. We encourage another service provider to pick up the Avalanche v2 migration. However, if required, we are happy to support provided it doesn't impact our key focus ares which we will be measure against.\n\n# Prior Work\n\nThis section, we will focus on what TokenLogic has delivered to Aave DAO:\n\n* [TokenLogic Delegate Platform](https://governance.aave.com/t/tokenlogic-delegate-platform/12516)\n* Asset Listings\n    * [[ARFC] Add FRAX to Aave V3 Ethereum](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-add-frax-to-aave-v3-ethereum/13051)\n    * [[AIP] Add FRAX Ethereum Aave v3](https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/260/)\n    * [[ARFC] Add FRAX Arbitrum Aave v3](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-add-frax-arbitrum-aave-v3/13222)\n    * [[AIP] Add ARB to Aave V3 Arbitrum Pool](https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/273/)\n* GHO Liquidity\n    * [[TEMP CHECK] GHO Liquidity Pools](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-gho-liquidity-pools/13655)\n    * [[ARFC] GHO Liquidity Pools: Primary Pools Initial Strategy](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-gho-liquidity-pools-primary-pools-initial-strategy/14071)\n    * Coordinated veBAL and vlAURA support for the launch of GHO\n* GHO Analytics Dashboard\n    * https://aave.tokenlogic.com.au/\n* GHO Yield Strategy\n    * Supported **Sommelier** with development of real yield strategies that manage GHO liquidity across several DEXs. Current at audit stage.\n    * Worked with **Beefy Finance** to launch several farming strategies that utilise Balancer GHO liquidity pools\n* Sunseting Polygon v2 - Via [Butter Incentivized Delegate Campaign](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-incentivized-delegate-campaign-3-month/11732)\n    * [[TEMP CHECK] Polygon v2 to v3 Liquidity Migration](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-polygon-v2-to-v3-liquidity-migration/12350)\n   * [[ARFC] Polygon v2 - Parameter Update](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-polygon-v2-parameter-update/12817)\n    * [[AIP] Polygon v2 - Parameter Update](https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/250/)\n    * [[AIP] Reserve Factor Updates - Polygon Aave v2](https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/?proposalId=284)\n* Supply Cap Increase\n    * [[ARFC] Supply Cap - stMATIC Polygon](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-supply-cap-stmatic-polygon/14355)\n    * [[AIP] Supply Cap Update - stMATIC Polygon v3](https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/?proposalId=300)\n* Polygon v2 Treasury to v3 Migration\n    * [[Payload] Treasury Management - Polygon v2 to v3 Migration](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-proposals/pull/267) \n    * [[AIP] Treasury Management - Polygon v2 to v3 Migration](https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/?proposalId=303)\n* Avalanche v2 Treasury to v3 Migration\n    * [[TEMP CHECK] Treasury Management - Avalanche v2 to v3 Migration](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-treasury-management-avalanche-v2-to-v3-migration/14218)\n    * [[ARFC] Treasury Management - Avalanche v2 to v3 Migration](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-treasury-management-avalanche-v2-to-v3-migration/14469)\n\nThere are also several gauge proposals presented on the Balancer governance forum and even BPT asset listing proposals on Sturdy Finance that support GHO's launch and depositing funds into Aave v3 respectively.\n\nDelivering the above work has enabled TokenLogic to grow the team beyond @MatthewGraham and @DeFiJesus, to include @Dydymoon, @scottincrypto, @agentmak and TBA (soon). With several developers, strategists and accountants apart the team, we are mostly manned up and ready to take on a more involved service provider scope. \n\n# Budget\n\nWe are requesting a total budget of 350,000 USD for an initial 6 month period to support our initiatives.\n\nThis budget will contribute to covering operational expenses, including tools, subscriptions, and infrastructure plus the resources required to deliver our work.\n\nThe payment terms are as shown below:\n\nUpfront Transfer: ~~210,000~~ 0 GHO\nStream: ~~140,000~~ 350,000 GHO\n\nThis is a ~~60/40~~ 0/100 split of upfront/streamed.\n\nAddress: `eth:0x3e4A9f478C0c13A15137Fc81e9d8269F127b4B40`\n\nSimilar to ACI, TokenLogic is to be included in the [Gas Rebate](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-gas-rebate-for-recognized-delegates/13290) program that reimburses on-chain voting, calling revenue contracts and deployment costs.\n\nTokenLogic commits to not receiving any funds from other entities for creating proposals and publishing AIPs on Aave Protocol.\n\n# Defining Success\n\nThe below provides an overview of how the DAO can assess TokenLogic's performance:\n\n* Migrate Aave DAO funds from v2 to v3\n* Create Liquidity Committee with funding\n* Optimise GHO liquidity incentives \n* Strategic Assets are being actively used\n* Runway funding sustained (>6 months of the correct assets)\n* Convert Treasury assets to LSTs\n* Launch financial statement frontend\n* Continual flow of new GHO Dashboard features\n\nAs DAOs are dynamic, when more urgent priorities emerge TokenLogic will support and proactively work with other service providers to act in Aave's best interest. \n\n# Next Steps\n\nIf the [TEMP CHECK] is successful and the community supports our proposal, we will move forward with a formal [ARFC] submission to governance.\n\nWe are committed to maintaining transparency throughout the process and providing regular updates the community on our progress.\n\nWe thank everyone for considering our proposal and appreciate your support. We look forward to working together and driving success to the Aave Protocol.\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

The scope of contribution will span the following areas of the DAO’s finances:\n\n* Treasury Management;\n* Strategic Assets’ Liquidity; and\n* Safety Module.\n\nThe combined karpatkey and TokenLogic team presents an unparalleled offering of specialized skills and proven technical expertise, with a network that spans most of DeFi.\n\n# Motivation\n\n## Treasury Management\n\nAave is the leading cross-chain lending protocol by all relevant KPIs i.e. TVL, supplied; and borrowed assets. With the latest version (v3) present on 10 networks, Aave Protocol currently generates revenue across ten networks and 18 deployments (v1, v2 incl. Centrifuge and ARC, v3 incl. Spark), consolidating a cross-chain treasury that’s currently worth around $130M.\n\n![|576x335](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/63TVEW32fnDI7_Dg3E5Mzw1XnQJd8284sa4VJ_XfrFWfVLsiEH4lX134c-X5StL4qo7L5QZOQaId-a8MQURHy2Ml3eeDfuSe8DdXRwDF-wK9cMJm26NLZjw9Ys6PZRYCT3YeUl7m49HJo_5C_tt9NeI \"Chart\")\n\nIn spite of having a significantly sized treasury, the Aave DAO faces mainly three challenges with its current treasury composition and operational practice.\n\n### Portfolio Volatility\n\nA significant portion of the treasury is held in the DAO’s native token (AAVE) which currently has limited DeFi utility and introduces volatility in the overall treasury value. The following chart illustrates the treasury allocation across various crypto assets.\n\n![|522x304](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/MAvZlV6jGMF6UfYcfO54H761nqHULxFYABWN0b-et8UjKGF1T9ZhzphJZqwlT6r8RcvQ2q9ovKLmLddvKRSiwwUhsAtlFoYpJCimdbzf6bUI0JkRsxkfed0HGSfwvh646x_mVaJlLVIA1Lc9ZltgwKA \"Chart\")\n\n### Asset Dispersion\n\nTreasury funds are dispersed around multiple collector contracts deployed in different blockchains. These funds are a direct result of how the protocol captures value and are mostly denominated in aTokens (~61) according to market activity, which requires constant rebalancing to meet expense requirements. This activity has historically been carried out through the governance processes, lacking comprehensive and up-to-date data on portfolio composition and rationale for asset allocation.![|688x384](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/TOGbL74wUrt6nMH83_jLP5kdJMQqX0Bnm4F0Qy3b605oaEz6z0xO1A3qw8ysj1hZdjzqm8MlSLP8hlesdTy3CegW3JEErznwfRdUX1YzgJS2ni8Cdb0btuuJE35VvcQi1KJVMB-Z3w7bVaSGVtlvn7U)\n\nThe DAO has only recently gained the ability to move funds between Polygon and Ethereum, while all other Treasuries are isolated, often leading to missed opportunities for leveraging the DAO’s funds. These opportunities are crucial for enhancing and capitalizing on synergies within the Aave ecosystem, including GHO management and the Safety Module.\n\n### Runway\n\nAccording to the latest [forecasted expenses](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-aave-funding-update/), the DAO’s 12-month budget is over $19M.\n\n|Category|Budget $k|Duration (mths)|Annualized Budget|\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|Security¹|$1,500|6|$3,000|\n|[Risk Management](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-aave-funding-update/15194/8)|$1,600|12|$1,600|\n|Bug Bounty|$1,000|12|$1,000|\n|Gov.

Certora only.\n2. AGD figures based on discussions with the team.\n\nWhile there are ongoing plans to secure part of this amount of stablecoins, most of it is allocated in high utilization Aave lending markets. Although reckoning the strategic rationale, holding most of the assets in the DAO’s own protocol exposes the portfolio to excessive risk in a volatility event scenario e.g. exploit.\n\n![|669x363](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/Aq6xqeeq_hr2ObgV9PFBiQrn6BFRk718dJywySHO4U7jRyUXSsMDyl7CdMhdf1cGOht1143KdBZy4mEagWkrum9CBeapl2HnDnSFfRbFNaPB4-3pZH0veEu8nMoo2cAw3-uohJYNq8s8zKUn-J45spg \"Chart\")\n\nWith the aim to support the protocol’s self-sustainability, treasury management should aim to reduce long tail asset exposure, ensure a 12-month financial runway and a stablecoins allocation that balances servicing Aave users and the DAO’s capital preservation.\n\n## GHO Development\n\nAave developed [GHO](https://docs.gho.xyz/concepts/overview) as a stablecoin native to the ecosystem and controlled by Aave Governance that enables a new level of transparency and censorship resistance. Technically, [GHO](https://etherscan.io/address/0x40d16fc0246ad3160ccc09b8d0d3a2cd28ae6c2f#readContract) is a collateral-backed stablecoin minted by users who lock up collateral assets in Aave's v3 protocol. The protocol uses smart contracts to manage the issuance and burning of the token through allow-listed entities called [Facilitators](https://docs.gho.xyz/concepts/how-gho-works/gho-facilitators), whose capacity to mint GHO (bucket) is enabled by Aave’s governance.\n\nAiming to enable committed AAVE token holders to capture additional value, GHO’s [debt strategy](https://etherscan.io/address/0x4C38Ec4D1D2068540DfC11DFa4de41F733DDF812#readContract) introduces an innovative concept of [rate discount](https://etherscan.io/address/0x4C38Ec4D1D2068540DfC11DFa4de41F733DDF812#readContract) by staking AAVE.\n\nWith an [on-chain vote executed in July](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/aave/proposal/268?chart=0), Aave launched GHO with two Facilitators (Aave itself and GHO FlashMinter), a borrowing rate of 1.5%, and a discount rate of 30% for AAVE stakers. Since then, the borrowing rate has been [increased to 4.72%](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0x9789e054e29f63da5713368be2dd0b4006f4564ef5e48c9d5e994ec20e932e35).\n\n![|690x391](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/7UXzX05dWaMixQmE4B-lkjHuv4-fu2jIFs8bn03_gLYG8hjpIm2mPHK4uhWVcyetMgZPUlWekoavWr1pfc43F15YuXkIZPy1r1K71mtU6WxdBl4rdzw4zMiABAUsHgRDP4d-BdkW_E-EcFgA1qArif0)\n\n![|691x345](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/qdTC5Jy9o8-ciz62oGpAZDGq2KOMK7V2h1S8PL-G6oawfXSJMz02eQSaeIofbcvmatQBOGogKZSyVDeLZCHpbSLDRsiCATHipR5EGO0lzc4jwoaiB3VpInOtUgiypK9UTy6mIflJpvlS6yaAmcn4pHE)\n\nAs demonstrated by GHO’s price chart, the most immediate challenge the Aave community is facing is the persistent trading of GHO at a discount practically since deployment. This trend has been influenced by higher stablecoin-enabled market rates like MakerDAO's Dai Savings Rate (DSR), creating a rate arbitrage opportunity. This cycle of borrowing and selling GHO harms GHO holders as it generates selling pressure, leading to a loss of value and eroding trust in GHO's stability. It also encourages a speculative pattern among GHO minters motivated to borrow and dump the asset, followed by repurchasing at a lower price, further driving down its value.\n\nFor the long-term health and success of GHO, two more enduring aspects require the community’s attention:\n\n### Peg Mechanisms\n\nThere's a crucial need for robust peg mechanisms tailored specifically for GHO that go beyond tactical borrow rate adjustments. Such mechanisms should be designed to help maintain GHO's value relative to its peg, irrespective of broader market movements or temporary arbitrage opportunities. Effective peg maintenance strategies will provide the dual benefits of protecting GHO's value in turbulent market conditions and reinforcing its utility as a stable and reliable medium of exchange within the DeFi ecosystem, thus addressing the core issue of price stability head-on.\n\n### Demand\n\nThe second one is generating organic demand that leads to an increased supply, mainly demand vectors external to the platform, but also including growth rooted in value-generating activities within the DeFi ecosystem. Without these value-generating flows, GHO faces the risk of remaining underutilized, hampering both its adoption and functionality as a stablecoin meant to facilitate economic activity.\n\n![|654x345](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/0K9JhuF5N6ScUkxYuGisZNp4S0IQ0qfc1ZvnW59aTIzisXhXB-4w5PX_2pzyTKs9sOlZkPikzm2IPx-uC_B366JsFOyHrmVqFYdLfmef0fBEaXquwkH-f48RAzVfmM9AqARhdcJ_EIQn7IrxaMv2fU0)\n\nCurrently, external demand for GHO has predominantly centered around its exchange for USD tokens and liquidity provision. While providing liquidity has been the sole avenue for yield generation, there has been a noticeable decrease in the allocated GHO liquidity recently.\n\n## Safety Module\n\nThe Aave Safety Module (SM) provides the DAO with an insurance-like fund expected to repay users of lost funds resulting from Aave’s smart contract exposure. The current composition of the insurance fund is overweight AAVE to the point where there exists a negative feedback loop between potential Bad Debt exposure and the AAVE token price.\n\n![|657x294](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/Haaciw-Es4QZS2QZBueQ1g1ar-L_e_Lp6MRd1neEqlzndAy5gha5PLUtYYo1QKy_k80ZGSP-cEGf-rVYbRrqZ3L0W_m6kcN3EZBcW2ciXFr5FZnQR-jPlKBHKgzQ20dOmlAVksGqlflbCk-At3Uq4d4)\n\nIf a Short Fall event was to occur, speculators could frontrun the AAVE auction, potentially even trigger liquidations on Aave Protocol, and cause the auction to occur at a lower than otherwise AAVE price. This unintentional feedback loop can be partially mitigated by modifying the safety module fund with the introduction of additional assets over time.\n\nFurthermore, the previously outlined negative feedback loop involving AAVE's price, liquidations, and bad debt results in a high cost for utilizing AAVE tokens. Consequently, it is necessary to reevaluate the incentivization of liquidity in the Safety Module, aiming for a more efficient allocation of DAO funds.\n\n![|693x410](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/675CMMvT7wcInW2NSWdJ11ByiOKa-aC627ziLQQ_WSVR_nRljGEgKdaxRZbS5RRiAQ5MSVuYC-_Vu2_5fSiWBLtmxBuENsf2GJnBVqkOnTdgH4BabaF680wEQkHSWK2OxkO87lQs9ncUOhb8yQEcyPk)\n\nThe daily cost of sustaining the SM is estimated to be approximately 100k USD per day at the prevailing AAVE distribution rate and market price. If all the AAVE and B-80AAVE-20wETH can be auctioned off at spot prices, the insurance funds coverage ranges from 1.7% to 3.2% of TVL over the last 18 months. For each $1 of coverage provided, the Aave DAO is paying approximately 31 cents each year. With a reduction in AAVE rewards, as proposed [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-treasury-management-amend-safety-module-aave-emissions/14936), the costs of sustaining the insurance fund will be reduced.\n\n## Why Partnering?\n\nAll of the topics mentioned above are deeply connected. Most of the assets contained in the treasury derive their value partly from their liquidity and the protocol’s security; the Safety Module’s effectiveness relies on attracting external capital through LP incentives; and GHO’s peg mechanism is dependant on liquidity, which could be incentivized using the treasury’s holdings.\n\nThere hasn’t been a holistic approach to these core activities of Aave DAO’s financials so far, which ultimately has led to [uncoordinated](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-enhancing-aave-daos-liquidity-incentive-strategy-on-balancer/15061/11?u=karpatkey) and inefficient decision-making processes.\n\nTokenLogic and karpatkey are partnering to provide Aave DAO with a comprehensive financial service solution. This partnership leverages:\n\n* Over three years of experience in advancing the Aave Protocol through a pivotal role in feature development and product adoption; and\n* A distinguished history of contributing to the most respected DAOs in the industry through specialized financial services.\n\nThe combined expertise of our teams is deeply rooted in the Aave ecosystem and extends across its community.\n\n### TokenLogic\n\nWe are a proactive team that puts our partners' needs first. Our developers are already actively contributing to the Aave Protocol, 23 AIPs to date. We believe in Aave’s incremental improvement process and building solutions that enable the DAO to manage its finances efficiently whilst minimizing external dependencies.\n\nOur dedication was demonstrated when we presented a proposal to improve the Aave DAO’s runway and built a preliminary frontend for the community. Our analysis will continue to showcase the interactive and transparent theme of the GHO Analytics platform. The refined scope primarily focuses on Treasury Management, GHO Liquidity/adoption and the Safety Module.\n\n### karpatkey\n\nkarpatkey is a DeFi-native organization specializing in professional DAO finance through industry-leading research and tooling since 2020. We’ve been working with [GnosisDAO](https://forum.gnosis.io/t/karpatkeys-weekly-report-on-gnosisdao-farms/6219), [Balancer](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/karpatkey-s-weekly-report-on-balancerdao-farms/4386), [ENS](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/endowment-weekly-reports/16665), [CoW Protocol](https://forum.cow.fi/t/cow-treasury-report-for-march-2023/1624https://forum.cow.fi/t/cow-treasury-report-for-march-2023/1624), and [Lido](https://snapshot.org/#/lido-snapshot.eth/proposal/0xac31f800288c68e32d1eb3cea7a525022faae3eb3bf805d1b3d248cda5375a13) on financial planning, operations, and strategy, diversifying their treasuries into sustainable portfolios of DeFi investments designed to support DAOs in executing their missions. Check out our [values](https://www.karpatkey.com/contents/karpatkey-values) to understand a bit more about our guiding and decision-making principles.\n\nAs DAO treasury developers, we contributed to some of the most reputable DeFi protocols in our industry. We supported the adoption of xDAI across Gnosis Chain, [paving the way](https://x.com/GnosisDAO/status/1673343419232526340) for the deployment of sDAI that [boosted chain TVL](https://x.com/DLNewsInfo/status/1714990022598787118) and consolidated a stablecoin hub with the integrations like Angle and Spark. Our extensive experience provided us with advanced practical knowledge on DeFi primitives like stableswap and concentrated liquidity AMMs, liquidity, and voting incentives, veTokenomics, leverage and lending platforms, and integrations with top protocols.\n\nIn addition to being an active [Aave delegate](https://governance.aave.com/t/karpatkey-delegate-platform/14417) with more than 90 governance votes since August 7th, we’ve contributed to the [development of an Aave fork](https://forum.gnosis.io/t/karpatkey-2022-year-in-review-for-gnosis/6431#lending-protocols-5) project and historically deployed, borrowed, and staked a combined $26.51M worth of LP positions in both Aave V2 and V3.\n\nWe now believe we can meaningfully contribute to solidifying Aave’s position as the leading DeFi lending protocol, not only through domain expertise but mostly through pushing positive-sum initiatives with the DAOs we work with.\n\n# Specification\n\nThis proposal outlines a collaborative framework between TokenLogic and karpatkey to manage the Aave DAO's treasury. Both parties will work in unison to ensure any future proposals within the agreed scope are jointly developed and endorsed.\n\n## Architecture for Asset Management Tooling\n\nWe aim to define and implement a robust architecture for asset management. At a high level, this architecture will enable non-custodial asset management, incorporating role-based access controls preapproved by the community that will enable treasury diversification and yield optimization. This system will ensure the Aave DAO retains full control over fund retrieval and permission management, facilitated through Aave’s \"shortExecutor\". All designs will be aligned with Aave best practices, and will encompass required steps to update existing infrastructure (e.g. SAM).\n\nAs the architecture for treasury management is being developed, the TokenLogic and karpatkey partnership will diligently progress with the necessary treasury operations, aligning them with the needs of the DAO and the stipulations of this proposal. All activities will be conducted in accordance with the established AIP model to avoid any disruptions.\n\n## Financial Security\n\nA key objective is to secure sufficient funds to ensure a one-year runway, aligning with the DAO's known budget and anticipated expenses as shared above. This approach guarantees financial stability and an operational continuity for Aave DAO.\n\nKey components of this objective will include:\n\n* Bridging Aave funds from other blockchains to consolidate them in Ethereum;\n* Migrating primary stablecoin funds from Aave v2 to Aave v3 for improved experience in using aTokens as payments; and\n* Swapping secondary stablecoins in mainnet prioritizing GHO.\n\nDo note, Financial statements have been omitted in order to present a cost conscious, high-impact solution within the current budget. If the Aave DAO wishes to explore having financial statements as part of a broader proposal, we can later expand the funding to include the additional scope.\n\nAs it currently stands, all necessary preparation for incorporating financial statements as part of the earlier TokenLogic proposal has been paused due to overall Aave budget considerations.\n\n## Formation of the Aave Liquidity Committee\n\nThis expanded committee will oversee the management of liquidity incentives and Aave-owned liquidity in alignment with Aave’s strategic asset goals. One of the main focus areas will be supporting GHO’s token price recovery. Key initiatives include:\n\n* Foster concentrated liquidity profiles that support GHO's price movement towards re-pegging, while maintaining its utility across a full range AMMs.\n  * Utilize Maverick's design to automate liquidity concentration as prices evolve, while reducing the friction caused by liquidity fragmentation in concentrated boosted pools.\n  * Optimize incentives on Uniswap v3 for concentrated liquidity, tailored across three categories: fees, GHO, and other USD token liquidity. Prioritize USD liquidity, particularly when GHO is off-peg.\n  * Continuously review and adjust incentives on platforms that yield the best results.\n  * Initial focus is on skewed liquidity distribution to support regaining the peg. However, it is paramount to ensure existing liquidity providers find sufficient utility on their GHO funds (through sustainable strategies that make use of Aave's AURA holding) to mitigate selling pressure.\n* Post-Repeg Strategy for GHO, explore sustainable approaches that preserve the token's value and expand its functional role within the ecosystem:\n  * Implement optimized liquidity strategies through Maverick and Merkl to achieve balanced liquidity and deeper market depth.\n  * Enhance GHO's extrinsic demand by incentivizing stableswap pools, such as Balancer's GHO pools, leveraging Aave’s capacity for a significant TVL increase.\n  * Work with Gyroscope to deploy liquidity pools that align with Balancer's architecture, using their advanced bonding curve model for concentrated liquidity AMMs. This strategic integration will use Aave-owned AURA to enhance GHO's price stability.\n  * Deploy and incentivize markets beyond USD-pegged assets, including ETH, ETH LSTs, EUR, and Real World Assets (RWAs). This diversification will open up new investment avenues and attract liquidity providers with varying risk appetites.\n  * Collaborate closely with Aave and specialized risk service providers to support the deployment and configuration of the GHO Stability Module (GSM). This coordination will focus on fine-tuning critical parameters, taking into account prevailing market conditions. Our objective is to integrate the GSM with managed capacity, potentially even before GHO achieves full re-pegging, as a strategic mechanism to foster price stability.\n* To optimize the utilization of surplus votes resulting from incentivized liquidity, we propose to leverage excess voting power effectively, transforming it in",

        "body": "Title: [ARFC] Aave Events & Sponsorship Budget\nAuthor: @AaveCompanies\nDate: 2023-10-15\n\n# Summary\nThis ARFC proposes the Aave DAO budget allocation on events at DevConnect, rAAVE, and ETHGlobal Istanbul that will drive awareness and attract new participants to the Aave’s Protocol, GHO, and Aave ecosystem. Thank you for reviewing this proposal and for your earlier questions and positive vote in the snapshot.\n\n# Motivation\nAave Protocol has consistently been at the forefront of DeFi innovation with pioneering features. With a strong emphasis on security, usability and composability, Aave has amassed a vibrant and engaged community of developers, users and stakeholders.\n\nAlthough the Aave Protocol has achieved success and recognition in DeFi, it’s important to retain strong community support and engagement as well as to continue to reach out to new people. We are proposing several thoughtful, well-organized and targeted events at DevConnect, including hackathons, booth presence, rAAVE and smaller side events that bring the broader community together. Community-building and reinforcing brand values and building recognition are essential to retaining and growing the participation of web3 users.\n\n# Overview\nAave Companies is requesting a budget allocation of $550,000 for the remainder of the year paid in GHO to support a range of targeted activations and events to continue growing and nurturing the global Aave Community. These initiatives will serve multiple purposes:\n1. Hackathons: Aave Companies intends to sponsor hackathons to encourage developers to build on Aave Protocol and stablecoin GHO. These hackathons not only provide a platform for the Aave community to connect with talented developers in both web3 and web2, but they also lead to the creation of innovative DeFi projects that enhance the Aave ecosystem.\n2. Side Events: Hosting side events alongside major conferences allows the Aave community to efficiently increase community awareness, foster connections, and share technical knowledge as well as industry insights. These events often include panels, workshops and discussions led by industry experts. Side events are also where Aave demonstrates our commitment to web3 ecosystem inclusivity and diversity by tapping into new communities and audiences. We’re proud to be supporters of groups such as SheFi and BoysClub.\n3. Merch: Aave Companies recognizes the importance of high-quality, sustainably produced merchandise in building brand recognition and loyalty. We intend to continue producing highly coveted Aave and GHO branded merchandise to distribute at events as part of community engagement efforts and to proliferate the ghost. We will continue to push for the use of sustainable materials, while creating merch that people actually wear, use and love. Finding appropriate partners is always extremely hard and we are proud that our team has been able to find good, cost-effective solutions. We don’t expose the cost per piece, however, we are very mindful of costs here and in all expenditures, making sure to receive bids and assess each partner individually for cost, quality, execution and sustainability.\n4. Development of the GHO Pass: With one of the core missions of the Aave community being to grow GHO by stimulating demand, expanding its utility, and accelerating its transactional velocity, we’re excited to announce Aave Companies’ development of the GHO Pass. The GHO Pass V1 will facilitate GHO purchases at both Aave events and sponsored events. We plan to launch GHO Pass at DevConnect, where users can get early access to select rAAVE tickets and drink credits, exclusive merch and other perks. This initiative will support GHO adoption and ensure that the Aave community and others unfamiliar with GHO, will experience the power of GHO as a payment layer at DevConnect and outside this event in the future. We plan for any proceeds from the GHO pass to go back directly into the budget for future activities that support the protocol and GHO. This is for accounting simplicity reasons.\n5. rAAVE: To celebrate, give back to the Aave community and attract new users, we plan for Aave DAO to host another edition of the vibrant and highly anticipated rAAVE event. This event serves as an excellent opportunity to create a memorable experience for the Aave community and spread Aave culture. We will also explore live streaming rAAVE, and integrating GHO pass (as mentioned above). As organisers, we will manage the ticketing logistics. We will also manage press relations social and other related Aave communications at no extra direct costs to the DAO. We want to keep the fine details of how the event is orchestrated and related detailed cost break down confidential both for flexibility and competitive reasons. The cost structure is a blueprint to how the event, which is unparalleled in the industry, is successfully executed. It is important that rAAVEs are available for Aave community members and we will find a way to provide a window of opportunity to claim a ticket. Tickets are available via multiple avenues tied to different activities and timing, and we conduct outreach to various organizations to target different audiences and demographics to enhance diversity and attract strategic partners and developers.\n\n# Activations\nActivations continue to be a key focus and driver of growth for the Aave ecosystem thanks to:\n- Creating a welcoming, engaging,memorable and Aave branded experience at the Aave booth.\n- Sponsoring side events, hackathons, prizes and providing exceptional support to developers.\n- Spreading Aave’s culture by distributing highly coveted merchandise.\n- Selectively hosting rAAVEs to bring the Aave community together, reward contributors and make Aave the top ecosystem in crypto.\n- Developing GHO Pass payment portal to showcase the power and utility of GHO.\n\n| Name  |  Date  | Details |\n| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |\n| ETH Global Istanbul  | Nov 17-19  | During the week of Devconnect. ETHGlobal puts on arguably the most reputable hackathon events in the Ethereum ecosystem. Istanbul is a community with substantial and growing crypto adoption and is a prime market to engage hackers and the community with Aave and GHO.  |\n| rAAVE  | Nov TBD  | rAAVE brings the community together, helping to strengthen Aave’s culture and differentiate Aave’s ecosystem. We will host one rAAVE during the course of this proposal that is powered by GHO to help spread adoption and awareness.  |\n| Devconnect + Side Events  | Nov 13-19  | Devconnect is the event of the year in the Ethereum community. Hosted by the Ethereum Foundation, it is expected to be the most attended web3 event of 2023. Activating here allows us to efficiently reach a wide audience of developers and others in the broader ecosystem and connect with many from our community. The total allocation request for DevConnect covers several side events that are selected carefully to maximize impact. The booth experience and design is in line with previous spending and the Aave booth consistently outperforms, attracting a significant number of developers, community members and people who are unfamiliar to the Protocol.  |\n| Side Events\t  | Q4  | Side events selection is based on strengthening Aave’s and GHO’s presence within various strategic audiences, outreaching to new target audiences, ensuring Aave remains top-of-mind within and outside the community, and gaining awareness of GHO. Side events we’re currently considering include: SheFi Summit Istanbul, Certora at DevConnect, Scroll Day, notDevcon by ITU Blockchain, StableSummit Istanbul. Funds from any side events that are not confirmed will be rolled over and held in the marketing budget for potential other side events of import here or at other events in the future.  |\n\nFor this proposal, Aave Companies is focusing on sponsoring fewer events, while increasing the quality and impact of Aave’s presence.\n\nA majority of the new event spend will be used to have an impactful presence during Devconnect, ETHGlobal Istanbul, and rAAVE to drive hackers to build with GHO and to increase GHO utilization within the wider community. Since Devconnect week will be the marquee event of the year, any remaining budget after the main sponsorships will be allocated to side events related to DeFi or Smart Contract Security.\n\nWe have a robust tracking system for all Aave DAO-related expenditures. We are very careful to sequester funds and have strong internal ethical guidelines and accounting procedures that are followed to ensure funds are used appropriately. Aave Companies will ensure that the budget from this proposal will be used only for specific, community approved, Aave-related endeavors and that any excess budget is rolled back into the events marketing budget that supports Aave and GHO outreach.\n\n# Next Steps\n- If Snapshot is successful, then move to AIP\n\n# Conclusion\nAave Companies is deeply committed to the Aave community. We believe that the proposed one-off budget allocation of $550,000 paid in GHO for activations and events for the remainder of 2023 will not only enrich the Aave ecosystem but also foster innovation, inclusivity, and recognition. We look forward to the DAO’s support in enabling these important initiatives to come to life and continue to drive the growth of the Aave ecosystem. We will rollover any excess allocation to Q1 2024 events.",

        "author": "0x57ab7ee15cE5ECacB1aB84EE42D5A9d0d8112922",
        "body": "This proposal seeks to add KNC (Kyber Network Crystal) to Aave v3 on Ethereum.\n\nAuthors: Maxax; Shane\n\nDate: 12/09/2023\n\n## References\n\n* Project website: https://kyberswap.com/\n* Documentation: https://docs.kyberswap.com/\n* Github / source code: https://github.com/KyberNetwork\n* Ethereum contracts: [0xdeFA4e8a7bcBA345F687a2f1456F5Edd9CE97202](https://etherscan.io/token/0xdeFA4e8a7bcBA345F687a2f1456F5Edd9CE97202)\n* Chainlink Oracle - KNC/USD Price Feed :[ 0xf8ff43e991a81e6ec886a3d281a2c6cc19ae70fc](https://data.chain.link/ethereum/mainnet/crypto-usd/knc-usd)\n\nAudits:\n\nBecause we are limited in the number of links, please find more information on our docs.\n\n* KyberDAO & KNC audit by Hacken\n* KyberSwap Elastic protocol audit by ChainSecurity\n* KyberSwap Classic protocol audit by ChainSecurity\n\n## Summary\n\nKyberSwap (Kyber Network’s flagship product) is a multi-chain DEX aggregator + concentrated liquidity platform, which aims to offer superior rates for traders and capital efficient returns for liquidity providers.\n\nKyber launched on Ethereum in February 2018 and is a pioneer in the DeFi space, developing one of the earliest decentralized exchange protocols (DEX) with Vitalik Buterin as an advisor. The team spearheaded the launch of WBTC (Wrapped Bitcoin) - the most popular ERC20 version of Bitcoin today (and a collateral asset on Aave V2 & V3), as well as developing liquidity pools on KyberSwap that offers concentrated liquidity and capital efficiency for any token pair. Kyber was the most used DeFi protocol in 2019 according to Binance Research and also part of the pioneer batch of Alliance DAO/DeFi Alliance mentors and Asia DeFi Network. Today, KyberSwap is one of the most popular DEX aggregators and liquidity platforms on Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, Avalanche, Base, and other chains.\n\nThis proposal aims to list the **[Kyber Network Crystal (KNC) token]** as a supply and borrow collateral asset on Isolation Mode on Aave V3 Ethereum Market.\n\n## Motivations\n\nKyberSwap is one of the oldest and most popular DEX aggregators with an average of 500K web visitors per month. KyberSwap has already been deployed on 14 chains, including Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, Avalanche, and Base. Total trading volume has crossed $21B+ and current total value locked (TVL) on all chains is $60M+.\n\nKNC is Kyber’s utility and governance token, and an important part of KyberSwap operations. KNC holders can stake KNC to vote on proposals to improve KyberSwap. In return, KNC voters receive rewards from fees collected through trading on KyberSwap and other ecosystem collaborations. As more trades are executed and new protocols added, more rewards are generated.\n\nKNC is a liquid asset with many token holders. KNC holders may want to obtain additional liquidity without selling KNC so that they can still capture potential upside in token value. With KNC supported on Aave, KNC holders can borrow funds e.g. GHO for a wide variety of DeFi use cases, such as margin trading or for new investment opportunities, all without selling their current holdings.\n\nWe are keen on a long-term, strategic relationship with Aave and adding KNC as a supply and borrow collateral asset in isolation mode is a good first step towards this objective.\n\n### Isolation mode\n\nAdding support for KNC on Ethereum V3 in isolated mode would allow KNC holders to borrow stablecoins by leveraging their KNC position, attracting new KNC Deposits.\n\n### Specification\n\n**1- What is the link between the author of the TEMP CHECK and the Asset?**\n\nShane and Maxax are from the DAO & KNC Strategy team at Kyber Network, managing Kyber’s strategic efforts regarding the KyberDAO and KNC tokenomics for KNC holders.\n\nEmails: shane@kyber.network ; max@kyber.network Telegram: @shaneHk , @maxaxeth Twitter: shaneMkt, 0xmaxax\n\n**2- Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token.**\n\nKyberSwap is Kyber Network's flagship product, a multi-chain DEX aggregator + liquidity platform offering optimal trade routes and returns for liquidity providers.\n\nBenefits\n\n* Traders: Enjoy superior swap rates as KyberSwap aggregates liquidity from various DEX pools, including KyberSwap's pools. KyberAI, an on-chain analytics tool created by the Kyberswap team, identifies potential trending tokens and trading opportunities, while providing insights into those tokens. Limit Orders help traders swap tokens at desired rates.\n* Liquidity Providers: LPs deposit tokens into liquidity pools and earn compounding fees. Pools are flexible and have features such as anti-sniping and concentrated liquidity, mimicking higher levels of liquidity and achieving better capital efficiency, volume, and returns. Compared to a typical AMM DEX, KyberSwap offers much better slippage for an equivalent pool and trade size and liquidity on KyberSwap would result in a much bigger positive impact on swap rates. AAVE token LPs can consider setting up a pool on KyberSwap to enjoy these advantages.\n* Developers: can integrate KyberSwap pools/farms and aggregation API into their wallets and DApps, providing superior rates for users.\n\nGeneral Stats\n\n* 60+ DeFi/GameFi Dapp integrations\n* $21 Billion+ lifetime trading volume\n* 500K web visits (Average last 3 months)\n* 7,000 average DAU\n* 15,000 average daily transactions\n* Current total TVL on all KyberSwap pools: $60M+\n* Total TVL from aggregated DEXes: $29B+\n\nAbout KNC\n\nToken Contract (Ethereum): 0xdeFA4e8a7bcBA345F687a2f1456F5Edd9CE97202\n\nKNC is Kyber’s utility and governance token, and is an important part of KyberSwap operations. KNC holders can stake KNC to vote on KyberDAO governance proposals that determine KyberSwap improvements, protocol upgrades, fee adjustments, and other crucial decisions.\n\nIn return, KNC voters receive rewards from fees collected through trading activity on KyberSwap. As more trades are executed and new protocols added, more rewards are generated. KNC stakers are also eligible for gas refunds when they meet certain trading requirements.\n\nKNC investors include: Hashed, Signum, ParaFi, HyperChain, and Stake Capital.\n\n**3- Explain the positioning of the token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset?**\n\nKNC is the governance and utility token for KyberSwap, a leading DEX and Aggregator in DeFi.\n\nBy supporting KNC on Aave V3 Ethereum, we would give an additional utility to KNC holders by allowing them to borrow stables like GHO against their collateral token. In addition, users could lend or borrow KNC for leverage trading by using Aave protocol.\n\n* KNC is a highly liquid token but is still not on many decentralized lending platforms. Aave can easily be the biggest venue for KNC to be used as a borrow/collateral asset.\n* KNC price feeds are supported by Chainlink on Ethereum, as well as Polygon, Avalanche, BNB Chain, Optimism and Arbitrum.\n* KNC has over 16,000 token holders on Ethereum, including crypto VCs and other DeFi projects.\n* By supporting deposits of KNC as collateral, users can borrow stablecoins against their KNC to be used in various activities.\n* By supporting KNC as a borrow asset, KNC holders would be able to lend KNC to earn interest instead of selling their tokens. On the other hand, borrowers can borrow KNC for staking and voting on Kyber governance proposals or for liquidity mining.\n* There are a range of yield maximizing strategies and lower carry cost leveraged trading strategies that users could deploy.\n* Kyber team would gain the ability to deposit KNC from the treasury to borrow stablecoins for various activities.\n\nImportant note: More liquidity for KNC on Ethereum can be added if required by the Aave protocol; this can be discussed with the Aave team and community. We are also willing to provide some KNC incentives for Aave users if KNC is supported as a borrow and collateral asset.\n\n**4- Provide a brief history of the project and the different components: DAO (is it live?), products (are they live?). How did it overcome some of the challenges it faced?**\n\nKyber was founded by Victor Tran, Loi Luu, and Yaron Velner in 2017, with the first protocol live in February 2018. All 3 founders are well-known researchers in the Ethereum and DeFi community, and Victor and Loi were both Forbes 30 under 30 recipients. Yaron is also the founder of B.Protocol and Risk DAO.\n\nSince inception, KyberSwap has successfully facilitated over $21 billion in transactions and over a million trades for tens of thousands of users, with 60+ DeFi/Dapp integrations.\n\nKyberSwap currently supports 14 chains including Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, Avalanche, BNB Chain, ZkSync Era, Linea, Base, Polygon zkEVM, Fantom, Cronos, Aurora, BitTorrent, and Scroll (upcoming).\n\n* Developed one of the earliest DEXes in 2018 with Vitalik Buterin as an advisor.\n* One of the first platforms to aggregate liquidity pools/sources for swaps on Ethereum by integrating different DEXes.\n* Kyber initiated and co-launched Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC), the most used wrapped version of BTC in the DeFi space today and a collateral asset on Aave.\n* First to develop and launch amplified pools with high capital efficiency for any token pair (before Uniswap v3), not just stablecoins.\n* In terms of 24H volume, KyberSwap is a Top 3 DEX on Optimism and Linea, Top 4 DEX on Polygon, and Top 5 DEX on Arbitrum, due to its high capital efficiency (High Volume/TVL).\n\nMain Features\n\n* DEX Aggregator: KyberSwap's aggregation algorithm automatically selects the best trade routes and prices from over 70 DEXes, saving time and money for thousands of users and offering superior rates for traders on supported chains.\n* Concentrated/Amplified Liquidity Pools: KyberSwap offers Elastic Pools and Classic Pools for liquidity providers. Elastic Pools have customizable price ranges, anti-sniping features, compounded fees, and concentrated liquidity, leading to better returns. Classic Pools have an amplification factor for improved capital efficiency.\n* KyberAI On-chain Analytics: Based on a proprietary scoring algorithm that uses artificial intelligence and on-chain data, KyberAI is able to help users identify high potential or trending tokens and provide key insights about the price, volume, and on-chain behavior for those tokens.\n* Limit Order: KyberSwap allows users to set Limit Orders for automatic buying/selling of assets at desired prices. Buy limit orders trigger at or below the set price, while sell limit orders trigger at or above it.\n\n**5- How is KNC currently used?**\n\nKNC is Kyber’s utility and governance token, and an important part of KyberSwap operations.\n\n* Governance Rights: KNC holders can stake their tokens to become part of KyberDAO, gaining voting power to vote on KIPs (Kyber Improvement Proposals) which help govern KyberSwap and shape its development.\n* Voting Rewards: In return for staking, voting, and participating in governance, KNC holders are able to receive a portion of protocol trading fees generated on KyberSwap. More trades on KyberSwap generate more rewards for KNC holders.\n* Gas Refunds: KNC holders who stake their tokens are also able to enjoy gas refunds when they trade on KyberSwap, with the % of gas refunds dependent on their KNC staking tier.\n* Liquidity Provision: KNC holders can provide liquidity for the token by pairing it with another asset (e.g. KNC-USDC) and depositing the tokens into their preferred KyberSwap liquidity pool. KNC liquidity providers earn fees from the trading activity that goes through the pool.\n* Liquidity Incentives: KNC may be used by KyberDAO as liquidity mining rewards to incentivize liquidity providers on KyberSwap on top of standard trading fees, thereby providing more value to liquidity providers.\n\n**6- Emission schedule**\n\nThere is currently no automatic emission of KNC. All tokens for founders and advisors from the token sale have been distributed since September 2019.\n\n~14.3M KNC is managed by KyberDAO as part of an ecosystem growth fund to facilitate trade and liquidity mining, and other growth activities.\n\nKNC can be upgraded or minted by KyberDAO, subject to a DAO vote by KNC holders.\n\n**7- Token (& Protocol) permissions (minting) and upgradability. Is there a multisig? What can it do? Who are the signers?**\n\nKNC is an upgradeable token. The overall architecture for KyberDAO is largely based on Aave’s governance model with some differences/modifications such as the ability to enable the creation and voting of multi-option (generic, non-binary) proposals, and enabling the calculation of KyberDAO voting power based on a system that uses the KNC staking model.\n\nKNC is dynamic and can be upgraded or minted by KyberDAO (only via a vote) to better support liquidity and growth.\n\nThe DAO has in-built governance safeguards to ensure that any decision or contract alteration will always be preceded by a suitable time period of preparation and reflection, as well as a minimum voter participation threshold. In addition, we have a 5/9 multisig with the role of a DAO operator that assists with operational tasks and ensuring the integrity of the DAO. The multisig comprises a mix of Kyber team members and founders of external DeFi project representatives.\n\nThe Kyber team alone does not have the power to implement major changes to the KNC token, DAO, and the protocols in the network, without going through a DAO vote.\n\nChanges to KyberDAO and KNC can only be made by the KyberDAO via voting on a Kyber Improvement Proposal (KIP).\n\n**8- Market data (Market Cap, 24h Volume, Volatility, Exchanges, Maturity)**\n\nSource: Coingecko\n\n* Circulating market cap (12 September 2023): $90,543,409\n* 24H trading volume (12 September 2023): $10,065,292\n* Etherscan: 0xdeFA4e8a7bcBA345F687a2f1456F5Edd9CE97202\n* Top exchanges are already supporting the latest version of KNC. KNC can be obtained on KyberSwap as well as centralized exchanges such as Binance, Coinbase, Upbit, Bithumb, Bitrue, Crypto. com, OKX, Huobi, Bitfinex, KuCoin, Kraken, Gemini, MEXC, HitBTC, Gate. io, and Tokocrypto.\n\n\n### Risk parameters\n\nWhile we suggest the community wait for the feedback from risk management teams (e.g. Gauntlet), we recommend the following risk parameters to start the conversation.\n\nTicker: KNC\n\nContract Address : 0xdeFA4e8a7bcBA345F687a2f1456F5Edd9CE97202\n\n|Parameter|Value|\n| --- | --- |\n|Isolation Mode|YES|\n|Borrowable|YES|\n|Collateral Enabled|YES|\n|LTV|40%|\n|LT|50%|\n|LB|10%|\n|Debt Ceiling|TBD|\n|Reserve Factor|20%|\n|Supply Cap|TBD|\n|Borrow Cap|TBD|",

The timeline shows a stable and consistent lead for 'YAE' across all quartiles, with positive market impacts post-vote. Forum sentiment is mixed with a dominance of neutral and negative comments, reflecting some community concerns but not opposing the proposal outright.
