        "body": "## Author: ACI\n\n## Date: 2024-10-07\n\n----------\n> ARFC has been updated with latest Risk Parameters provided by Risk Service Providers. 2024-10-11\n\n---\n\n# **Summary**\n\nThis proposal aims to launch GHO on Base & set ACI as Emissions Manager for GHO and aGHO potential rewards and incentives.\n\n# **Motivation**\n\nWith a dedicated portion of GHO supply moving to the Arbitrum network and the generous grant from the Arbitrum DAO as part of the LTIPP, Aave DAO successfully bootstrapped GHO liquidity both within the Aave protocol and throughout the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\nBuilding on this success, it is now time to expand GHO to other networks. However, the lessons learned from the Arbitrum launch highlight the importance of coordinated efforts in several key areas:\n\n- Implementing the necessary smart contracts and infrastructure to support GHO on the  network\n- Establishing appropriate risk parameters and collateral requirements specific to the Base ecosystem\n- Integrating GHO with existing DeFi protocols and applications on Base to foster immediate utility\n- Collaborating with the community to ensure a smooth launch and widespread adoption\n\nThese factors underscore the significant effort required from all service providers to create a successful launch. This ARFC vote seeks community approval to proceed with the launch of GHO on Base.\n\n# **Specification**\n\nThe ACI invites all service providers to provide input on their scopes within this proposal. \n\nThe proposed launch of GHO on Base will involve the following key components:\n\n- BGD and Avara to implement and deploy the necessary smart contracts for GHO on the Base network, including cross chain bridge infrastructure and addition to Aave v3 Base.\n- Risk service providers and finance service providers should collaborate on  appropriate risk parameters and collateral requirements tailored to the Base ecosystem. From learnings on Arbitrum launch, ACI suggests a $25m starting bridge cap to allow for growth using the planned programs from the Base ecosystem.\n- ALC will create a plan to bootstrap initial liquidity for GHO on Base, potentially including incentives or partnerships with existing Base protocols.\n- ACI will coordinate with Base ecosystem teams to promote the GHO launch with appropriate support and incentives. The Base and Optimism ecosystem have provided a large commitment already. The DAO has [previously voted](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0x15cbc6b6c5b4ef76a1fb8cf8747460bf327c459fa01b69907fab0119457939a8) for a continued incentives program and matching of the OP Retroactive Grant, that can be used to launch GHO on Base.\n- ACI will be the Emission Manager for GHO and aGHO potential rewards and incentives.\n- ACI multisig address: `0xac140648435d03f784879cd789130F22Ef588Fcd`\n\nThe exact timeline and detailed technical specifications for each component will be determined by the service providers and presented in subsequent AIPs, pending the approval of this ARFC.\n\n| **Parameter** | **Value** |\n| --- | --- |\n| Asset | GHO |\n| Market | Base |\n| Isolation Mode | No |\n| Borrowable | Yes |\n| Collateral Enabled | No |\n| Supply Cap | 2,500,000 |\n| Borrow Cap | 2,250,000 |\n| Debt Ceiling | - |\n| LTV | - |\n| LT | - |\n| Liquidation Bonus | - |\n| Liquidation Protocol Fee | - |\n| Variable Base | 0% |\n| Variable Slope1 | 12% |\n| Variable Slope2 | 65% |\n| Uoptimal | 90% |\n| Reserve Factor | 10% |\n| Stable Borrowing | Disabled |\n| Flashloanable | Yes |\n| Siloed Borrowing | No |\n| Borrowable in Isolation | No |\n| E-Mode Category | N/A |\n\n## Useful Links\n\n[ARFC: Merit Base incentives and SuperFest matching](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-merit-base-incentives-and-superfest-matching/18450)\n\n# Disclaimer\n\nThe ACI is not presenting this ARFC on behalf of any third party and is not compensated for creating this ARFC.\n\n# Next Steps\n\n1.

This follows the original plans for further expansion on the network.\n\n### **Motivation**\n\nThe integration of sUSDe, USDe, and weETH into Aave v3 on zkSync is following the intitial plan for the zkSync network launch. With the successful launch of Aave v3 on zkSync, and some time for monitoring, we believe it is time to start expanding from the initial asset list. \n\nThese onboardings also include partnership with Ethena and EtherFi to add ZK token incentives to each market, which will contribute to Aave’s growth on zkSync.\n\n### **Proof of Liquidity and Deposit Commitments**\n\nAave DAO received an allocation of ZK during the network’s TGE. Ethena and EtherFi have both pledged to add additional incentives from their own ZK token allocations. These incentives will be used to grow the market with ACI acting as Emissions Manager.\n\n### **Specification**\n\n> Risk Parameters have been provided by Risk Service Providers and this ARFC has been updated based on their assessment. 2024-10-04\n\n| **Parameter** | weETH | USDe | sUSDe |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Isolation Mode | No | Yes | Yes |\n| Borrowable | Yes | Yes | No |\n| Collateral Enabled | Yes | Yes | Yes |\n| Supply Cap | 300 | 500,000 | 400,000 |\n| Borrow Cap | 150 | 50,000 | - |\n| Debt Ceiling | - | $500,000 | $400,000 |\n| LTV | 72.5% | 65% | 65% |\n| LT | 75% | 75% | 75% |\n| Liquidation Bonus | 7.5% | 8.5% | 8.5% |\n| Liquidation Protocol Fee | 10% | 10% | 10% |\n| Variable Base | 0% | 0% | - |\n| Variable Slope1 | 7% | 9% | - |\n| Variable Slope2 | 300% | 75% | - |\n| Uoptimal | 30% | 80% | - |\n| Reserve Factor | 45% | 25% | 20% |\n| Stable Borrowing | Disabled | Disabled | Disabled |\n| Flashloanable | Yes | Yes | Yes |\n| Siloed Borrowing | Disabled | Disabled | Disabled |\n| Borrowable in Isolation | No | No | No |\n| E-Mode Category | ETH-correlated | - | - |\n\n### **Disclaimer**\n\nThis proposal is powered by Skywards. ACI is not directly affiliated with Ethena or EtherFi and did not receive compensation for creation this proposal. ACI is a delegate in EtherFi. ACI and its members hold weETH.\n\n**Next Steps**\n\n1. If consensus is reached on this [ARFC], escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n2. If the ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, publish an AIP vote for final confirmation and enforcement of the proposal\n\n### **Copyright**\n\nCopyright and related rights waived under [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)",
