MakerDAO marked a significant milestone with a rebranded to Sky, introducing USDS and sUSDS as the new iterations of DAI and sDAI. Given the established track record and widespread adoption of their predecessors, we propose to onboard these new assets to Aave v3.\n\nBy integrating USDS and sUSDS into Aave v3, we aim to maintain continuity for users who have relied on DAI and sDAI while embracing the evolution of these assets under the Sky brand.\n\n### **Proof of Liquidity and Deposit Commitments**\n\nSky protocol team has discussed providing both token incentives and liquidity provision when USDS is onboarded. ACI is in discussion with members of Sky protocol team to finalize these programs.  \n\n### **Specification**\n\nBased on discussion with members of Sky protocol team, we propose the following: \n\n- sUSDS added as collateral and borrow asset to Aave v3 Main Instance\n- USDS added as supply and borrow asset to Aave v3 Lido Instance\n- Integration with Paraswap to allow users to seamlessly swap between DAI and USDS variants within the Aave system.\n\nWe invite all service providers and community members to weigh in on these suggestions. \n\nFinal contract addresses will be provided upon final launch of the Sky protocol.  \n\nRisk Parameters will be provided at ARFC Stage by Risk Service Providers.\n\n**Disclaimer:**\n\nThis proposal is powered by Skywards. ACI is not directly affiliated with Sky and did not receive compensation for creation this proposal.\n\n### **Next Steps**\n\n1. If consensus is reached on this [TEMP CHECK], escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n2. If the Snapshot outcome is YAE, this proposal will be escalated to ARFC stage\n3. Publication of a standard ARFC, collect community & service providers feedback before escalating proposal to ARFC snapshot stage\n4. If the ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, publish an AIP vote for final confirmation and enforcement of the proposal\n\n### **Copyright:**\n\nCopyright and related rights waived under [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)",

        "body": "## **Author: ACI**\n\n## **Date: 2024-10-04**\n\n---\n\n### **Simple Summary:**\n\nThe current TEMP CHECK aims to onboard EIGEN, the native token of Eigenlayer, in Aave V3 Ethereum Market. This onboarding will allow Aave users to supply and borrow EIGEN, thereby enhancing the utility and liquidity of the Eigenlayer token within the DeFi ecosystem and more specifically, within the Aave ecosystem.\n\n### **Motivation/Background:**\n\nEigenlayer is a protocol focused on shared security and restaking, enabling Ethereum stakers to extend their security guarantees to multiple services and protocols. EIGEN is the governance and utility token for Eigenlayer, playing a critical role in the network’s operations, staking mechanisms, and protocol governance. By onboarding EIGEN to Aave V3, we aim to create new opportunities for Aave users to engage with this emerging staking ecosystem, while expanding EIGEN's liquidity.\n\n**Benefits of listing that token:** \n\nProvide opportunities for Aave users to borrow against their EIGEN to unlock liquidity, or alternatively to borrow EIGEN against other collateral allowing them to stake it in the Eigenlayer ecosystem to earn rewards.\n\n**Market Impact:** \n\nWe see no significant market impact from onboarding EIGEN except for providing new opportunities to Aave users which may cause users to switch from borrowing other tokens against their collateral. Overall we see onboarding EIGEN as net good for Aave users as it expands opportunities for them to engage in a new, important ecosystem.\n\n**Chain to be deployed/listed:** \n\nEthereum Mainnet\n\n**Proof of Liquidity (POL) and Deposit Commitments:** \n\nPOL and Deposit Commitments will be discussed at the ARFC stage.\n\n### **Useful Links:**\n\n- [Eigenlayer website](https://eigenfoundation.org/)\n- [Eigenlayer documentation](https://docs.eigenfoundation.org/category/faq-eigen-token-overview)\n\n### **Disclaimer:**\n\nThis proposal is powered by Skywards. The Aave Chan Initiative is not directly affiliated with Eigenlayer Foundation and did not receive compensation for creation this proposal.\n\nACI and ACI employees may be holders of EIGEN.\n\n### **Next Steps:**\n\n1.

Users can freely mint BNBx in exchange for BNB deposits and earn yield from staking.\n\nThe Aave-Chan Initiative supports LST diversity in Aave V3 and looks to add more LST to the new BNB Chain deployment.\n\n## **Specification**\n\nContract address: [0x1bdd3cf7f79cfb8edbb955f20ad99211551ba275](https://bscscan.com/token/0x1bdd3cf7f79cfb8edbb955f20ad99211551ba275)\n\nDetailed risk parameters will be formulated and shared in the ARFC phase, after positive community feedback from this TEMP CHECK.\n\n**Useful Links**\n\n- Website: https://www.staderlabs.com/\n- BNBx docs: https://binance.docs.staderlabs.com/\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThe ACI is not presenting this TEMP CHECK on behalf of any third party and is not compensated for creating this ARFC.\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. If consensus is reached on this [TEMP CHECK], escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n2. If the Snapshot outcome is YAE, this proposal will be escalated to ARFC stage\n3. Publication of a standard ARFC, collect community & service providers feedback before escalating proposal to ARFC snapshot stage\n4.

Benefits of listing: \nslisBNB is the native yield bearing and liquid staking token for BNB, built by Lista DAO. slisBNB appreciates against BNB in line with BNB’s staking APR, allowing users have the freedom to earn additional yields on different DeFi platforms while earning staking rewards passively.\n\nslisBNB is the largest BNB LST in terms of TVL (~$225M) and holders (350,262), listing slisBNB can bring both Aave and Lista communities the opportunities to enjoy the passive yield of supplying slisBNB on Aave as well as the Lista token airdrop. \n\n2. Chain to be deployed: BNB Chain\n3. Proof of Liquidity: Lista DAO is open to provide $2500 weekly incentives, last for 8 weeks to bootstrap the liquidity of slisBNB on Aave. \n4. Useful links: https://lista.org/\n\n\n**Disclaimer**\nThis proposal is powered by core contributor of ListaDAO.\n\nThe Aave Chan Initiative is not directly affiliated with Lista DAO and did not receive compensation for creation this proposal.\n\n**Next Steps**\n1.If consensus is reached on this [TEMP CHECK], escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n2.If the Snapshot outcome is YAE, this proposal will be escalated to ARFC stage\n3.Publication of a standard ARFC, collect community & service providers feedback before escalating proposal to ARFC snapshot stage\n4.If the ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, publish an AIP vote for final confirmation and enforcement of the proposal\n\n**Copyright**\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.",
