For more details about LUSD please refers to [Aave V2 ARC by @TokenBrice ARC: Add support for LUSD (Liquity) 3)\n\nThis ARC is a joint effort with @Llamaxyz to allow a selection of assets to be onboarded on V3 via the governance process. Both Llama & ACI will propose AIPs on onboard assets on V3…\n\n# Motivation\nSupporting stablecoin diversity is part of the Aave-Chan Initiative (ACI) delegate platform.\n\nThe ACI does not have any link nor is paid by Liquity or any entity to present this ARC.\n\nThe risk parameters provided within are the same as those provided by Gauntlet within the initial forum post 1 discussing which assets to onboard to v3 Ethereum.\n\nThe Interest rate Strategy curve is the same than for LUSD in V2. for now the ACI is supportive to onboard LUSD as it was on V2, when the V3 will be more mature, the ACI is supportive to work on AIP to allow usage of LUSD as a collateral.\n\nBy presenting each asset to be onboarded to v3 Ethereum individually, the community can focus on a specific asset, with individual Snapshots determining how to proceed. Finally, approved assets listings can be grouped for the on-chain AIP vote.\n\n# Specification\nTicker: LUSD\n\nContract Address: https://etherscan.io/address/0x5f98805a4e8be255a32880fdec7f6728c6568ba0#code\n\nRisk Parameter\tValue\nIsolation Mode\tNO\nEnable Borrow\tYES\nEnable Collateral\tNO\nLoan To Value\tN/A\nLiquidation Threshold\tN/A\nLiquidation Bonus\tN/A\nReserve Factor\t10%\nLiquidation Protocol Fee\tN/A\nBorrow Cap\t1,210k\nSupply Cap\t3,000k\nDebt Ceiling\tN/A\nBase\t0%\nSlope1\t4%\nUoptimal\t80%\nSlope2\t87%\n# Copyright\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.",

As sufficient time has passed, it is now appropriate to move forward with the offboarding process for Aave V1.\n\n## **Motivation**\n\nAave V1 has served as a pioneering platform in the DeFi ecosystem. However, with the release of Aave V2 and Aave V3, it is essential to shift users and resources towards these more advanced and efficient platforms. By offboarding Aave V1 and encouraging migration to newer versions, we can ensure a more streamlined user experience and concentrate resources on continued development and improvements in the Aave ecosystem.\n\n## **Specification**\n\nThe offboarding plan will be executed by implementing new rate strategies for all assets listed on Aave V1. These rate strategies aim to incentivize users to migrate their assets to Aave V2 or Aave V3 by making borrowing and supplying less attractive on Aave V1. The new rate strategies will be applied to all assets listed on Aave V1.\n\n### **New Rate Strategies**\n\nFor each asset listed on Aave V1, new proposed values for the following parameters will be implemented:\n\n1. uOptimal: 20%\n2. reserveFactor: 99.9%\n3. base rate: 3%\n4. slope 1: 7%\n5. slope 2: 200%\n\nThese changes will make borrowing and supplying assets on Aave V1 less attractive compared to Aave V2 or Aave V3, encouraging users to migrate their assets to the newer platforms.\n\n## **Next Steps**\n\n1. Temperature Check: Gather community feedback and assess sentiment towards the proposal.\n2. ARFC: If the Temperature Check Snapshot indicates positive sentiment, proceed to the ARFC stage for further discussion and finalization of the proposal.\n3. AIP: If the ARFC stage Snapshot is successful, submit the proposal as an AIP for voting and on-chain governance approval.\n\n## **Copyright**\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.",

        "body": "## Summary:\nThis ARFC proposes a direct to AIP vote for cap changes or FreezeReserve() implementation if the following conditions are met:\n\nThe proposal is provided by a risk service provider or has received feedback from at least one risk service provider team.\nThe proposed cap change is not greater than a 100% increase of the current cap or the implementation of a cap.\nThe cap is being decreased.\nThe AIP is implementing a FreezeReserve().\nFor other situations, the normal governance process is applicable.\n\nThis framework is intended for All V3 liquidity pools. Relative to freezing reserves, this framework is intended for all Aave pools.\n\n## Motivation:\nSupply and borrow caps are important safety features of Aave V3, and they are essential for maintaining the stability of the platform. However, these caps can also have a significant impact on the growth potential of the platform. If a cap ceiling is met and governance takes too much time to adapt, this can slow down the growth of the platform and limit its ability to meet the needs of its users.\n\nGiven the importance of supply and borrow caps, it is essential to have a governance process in place that can quickly and efficiently adapt to changing market conditions. A long-term viable solution would be a clear framework and the election via governance of a Risk Council having a degree of Risk management capability over the Aave protocol. However, while the definition and implementation of this is technically allowed by the Aave codebase, it is still immature.\n\nAs a temporary buffer, this ARFC proposes a direct to AIP vote for cap changes or FreezeReserve() implementation under certain conditions to increase the efficiency of the governance process. By streamlining the governance process in this way, we can ensure that the platform can quickly and efficiently adapt to changing market conditions and meet the needs of its users.\n\n## Specification:\nAs there’s no need for on-chain AIP or technical implementation for this ARFC, the outcome of a snapshot vote will be considered canon.\n\n## Disclaimer:\nThe author of this ARFC, Marc Zeller, is the founder of the Aave Chan Initiative and owns AAVE tokens. However, the ACI is not paid by the Aave Companies nor any other entity to submit this ARFC.\n\n## Copyright:\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.",
