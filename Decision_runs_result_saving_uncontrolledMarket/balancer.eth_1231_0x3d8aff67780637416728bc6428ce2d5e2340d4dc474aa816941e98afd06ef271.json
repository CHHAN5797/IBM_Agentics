        "author": "0x512fce9B07Ce64590849115EE6B32fd40eC0f5F3",
        "body": "This proposal appears on [Balancer's forum](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/increase-the-protocol-fee/2533).\n\n# Motivation\n\nWith the coming transition to veBAL, it’s time to re-evaluate the economics around how the protocol captures fees. When the protocol fee was initially activated and set to 10% there was no plan for veBAL and no plan for how the collected fees would be used. After the activation of veBAL, 75% of protocol fees will go to lockers and 25% to the DAO. \n\nAccording to our most recent [revenue projections](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XSFTtEYg1kqRVvvPfFpqLT93PtZWBjEQfPf8-lH93_0/edit#gid=0) (credit Zekraken), lockers only stand to gain around $2.1M per year ($2.8M * 0.75).  With ~$95M in BAL/WETH that’s an APR of ~8%. Note that this assumes all LP’s lock and does not include revenue from other sources like the agreement with Copper (hard to accurately predict). There is upside to this 8% APR if fewer users lock and Copper revenue remains strong. \n\nThe vast majority of TVL, volume, and fee earnings come from pools that receive BAL incentives. There is little evidence to suggest that swap fees are driving any significant amount of usage at the moment. By introducing veBAL, we are making the competition around BAL incentives the primary driver of the protocol’s growth going forward. **We can accelerate the adoption of this flywheel effect by increasing the protocol fee from 10% to 50%.** This would move the 8% APR immediately to 30-40% APR. \n\nIt also has the added bonus of increasing the DAO’s potential earnings from ~$700k per year ($2.8M * 0.25) to potentially as high as ~$3.5M if there is no response from LP’s to the protocol fee increase. This allows the DAO to build up a stronger balance sheet and better prepare for extended market downturns. \n\nI believe we can choose to focus on BAL emissions as the primary growth driver OR swap fee earnings. Right now, most LP’s use Balancer because of BAL emissions and not because of swap fees. This means LP’s will want to lock veBAL so they can ensure continued emissions to their pool(s) of choice. Locking funds for a year carries significant opportunity cost, so that will be balanced by the revenue lockers receive from protocol fees. The higher that revenue, the more likely lockers will choose to participate in the “BAL wars”. \n\nFor those users of Balancer who are primarily interested in earning swap fees, there is little reason to lock veBAL. By keeping the protocol fee at 10%, we are placing a high value on these users in terms of the protocol’s future success. I would argue our path to success is in creating the strongest incentive possible for participation in veBAL. Increasing the protocol fee to 50% in combination with the release of veBAL creates a very compelling narrative for users to understand the value proposition in locking. \n\n# Risks\n\n* **LP’s who primarily value swap fee earnings will leave Balancer**\n\n* Mitigation: none. I believe this group represents a tiny number of total Balancer users, so this is an acceptable risk.\n* **This will hurt partners like Element who don’t rely on BAL rewards.**\n* Mitigation: We are in talks with partners to understand how an increase to 50% would affect them. There is also the potential for a revenue sharing arrangement in the future, where the 50% protocol fee would be split between the partner and Balancer DAO. \n* **As emissions decrease due to the new veBAL emission schedule, the protocol won’t be able to evolve to a model that is sustained with swap fees only**\n* Mitigation: If the goal is to move away from emissions entirely, it will be necessary to reduce the protocol fee as emissions come to an end. Alternatively, a new split of the protocol fee could be proposed that allocates some to buying BAL to distribute through the gauge system. This keeps liquidity mining going without requiring new emissions.\n\n# Specification\n\n\n```\nNetwork: mainnet                                                                                                                                                                                \nMultisig: 0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \nProtocolFeesCollector: 0xce88686553686DA562CE7Cea497CE749DA109f9F                                                                                                                               \n                                                                                                                            \nSet fee:\nProtocolFeesCollector.setSwapFeePercentage(500000000000000000);\n\nNetwork: polygon\nMultisig: 0xd2bD536ADB0198f74D5f4f2Bd4Fe68Bae1e1Ba80\nProtocolFeesCollector: 0xce88686553686DA562CE7Cea497CE749DA109f9F\n\nSet fee:\nProtocolFeesCollector.setSwapFeePercentage(500000000000000000);\n\nNetwork: arbitrum\nMultisig: 0x6207ed574152496c9B072C24FD87cE9cd9E17320\nProtocolFeesCollector: 0xce88686553686DA562CE7Cea497CE749DA109f9F\n\nSet fee:\nProtocolFeesCollector.setSwapFeePercentage(500000000000000000);\n```",

The exploiter still has excess R tokens, which can be swapped for liquidity, making it irresponsible to incentivize liquidity for the token. R pools were not included in the most recent core pool bribe. Due to the instability of the token, and Raft's intention to sunset the current version of the protocol, it is not necessary to incentivize liquidity for these pools any further. \n\n# Motivation\n\nDue to Raft sunsetting the current version of the protocol the R token should no longer be supported by BAL emissions. \n\n# Specifications\n\nThe DAO Multisig `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` will interact with the AuthorizerAdaptorEntrypoint at `0xf5dECDB1f3d1ee384908Fbe16D2F0348AE43a9eA` and call performAction using `0xab8f0945` for the `data(bytes)` argument and use each gauge address as the `target(address)`\n\nR/DAI - `0x6f3b31296fd2457eba6dca3bed65ec79e06c1295`\n\nR/sDAI - `0x3b861b81b086ef0cffa0b00cd2ddb3d545ec9b98`\n\nR/wstETH - `0x6e7b9a1746a7ed4b23edff0975b726e5aa673e21`\n\nCore pool status has already been removed for these pools, per discussion between the Maxis and the Raft team.",

This proposal aims to kill the current gauge and activate the gauge for a new pool containing ankrETH/bb-a-WETH. ankrETH has not changed since the initial proposal and bb-a-WETH is a WETH boosted pool using AAVE's lending market too boost the return on the underlying WETH. This would be net positive for LPs in terms of organic yield from AAVE and the pool would designated as a core pool. This additional boosted yield will increase the likelihood of a veBAL flywheel spinning up.\n\n**References/Useful links:**\n> • Website: [https://www.ankr.com/ ](https://www.ankr.com/)\n• Documentation: [Ankr Staking – Ankr](https://www.ankr.com/docs/staking/overview/)\n• Github Page : [Ankr · GitHub](https://github.com/Ankr-network)\n• Twitter: https://twitter.com/ankr [https://twitter.com/ankrstaking ](https://twitter.com/ankrstaking)\n• Reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/Ankrofficial/\n• Telegram: Contact @ankrnetwork\n\n**Protocol Description:**\n\n> Per BIP-165: Ethereum Liquid Staking as provided by Ankr Staking offers instant liquidity for your staked ETH, enabling you to connect your ankrETH tokens with DeFi platforms and earn several more layers of rewards. ankrETH is a reward-bearing token, meaning that the fair value of 1 ankrETH token vs. ETH increases over time as staking rewards accumulate.\n \n**Motivation:**\n\n> As described in the summary, pairing ankrETH with bb-a-WETH is net positive for all parties.\n\n**Specification**\n> 1. **Governance:** ANKR token-holders can propose and vote for changes to the Ankr Staking system. If a change receives enough votes, the Ankr team implement the agreed-upon changes to the platform. Further information may be found here: ANKR Governance Mechanics – Ankr\n> 2. **Oracles:** Does not apply\n> 3. **Audits:** Ethereum Liquid Staking smart contracts have undergone an external audit by Beosin Blockchain Security.

        "body": "## Abstract\n\nThis proposal aims to receive community support for whitelisting Yearn's yBAL locker/voter contract on Ethereum, to lock B-80BAL-20WETH for veBAL.\n\n## Motivation\n\nYearn is building yBAL, a new veBAL liquid wrapper (based on our successful yCRV product) designed to tokenize the different benefits of Yearn’s veBAL position. This system will be comprised of a base token (yBAL) as well as three “activated” yBAL tokens.\n\nyBAL can be minted by locking B-80BAL-20WETH into Yearn’s veBAL position (a permanent one-way “forever” lock). This operation mints yBAL to the user at a 1:1 rate. yBAL carries no yield itself but allows users to enter or exit the yBAL ecosystem. It will be soft-pegged to B-80BAL-20WETH via a Balancer pool.\n\nYearn passes the benefits from its veBAL position to the three activated yBAL tokens:\n\n**1. st-yBAL (staking rewards):**\n- st-yBAL will be a yVault that holds yBAL and receives yield from…\n- 100% of the admin fees from Yearn’s total veBAL position\n- Gauge voting bribes (any yBAL inside st-yBAL earns yield by voting for gauges with bribes).\n- All profit will be swapped for more yBAL which will be deposited back into the strategy.\n\n**2. lp-yBAL (liquidity pool rewards):**\n- lp-yBAL will be a yVault for the B-80BAL-20WETH/yBAL Balancer pool.\n- It will earn yield by auto-compounding BAL emissions and trading fees into more B-80BAL-20WETH/yBAL BPTs.\n\n**3. vl-yBAL (gauge voting power):**\n- vl-yBAL will be a contract that accepts yBAL and offers holders liquid on-chain veBAL gauge weight voting.\n- Broader Balancer DAO/gov votes will not be extended to vl-yBAL holders.\n- vl-yBAL holders receive no yield, only 100% of their respective veBAL gauge voting power.\n\nUsers can choose to move between activated tokens at any time depending on which benefits they want, except for vl-yBAL which will have time lock restrictions varying from 14 to 28 days.\n\n## Technical implementation:\n\nYearn's yBAL locker/voter has now been deployed...\n- 0xBA11E7024cbEB1dd2B401C70A83E0d964144686C\n\nWe propose adding it to the allowlisted addresses in the SmartWalletChecker (0x7869296Efd0a76872fEE62A058C8fBca5c1c826C) so that we can launch the yBAL ecosystem and begin locking B-80BAL-20WETH for veBAL.",

        "author": "0x512fce9B07Ce64590849115EE6B32fd40eC0f5F3",
        "body": "This proposal appears on [Balancer's forum](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/proposal-increasing-flexibility-of-liquidity-mining-program/2446).\n\n\n**Background**\n\nIt has been roughly 8 months since the original liquidity mining [framework](https://snapshot.org/#/balancer.eth/proposal/QmeCrSe5xL5YWB17TjxAofYi3QnBMyHCYqufD8t3Zonj4S) was officialy set into motion. The structure that the program put into place was necessary at the time since the liquidity mining committee was just being formed. However its tiered system is very rigid and that rigidity causes some inherent challenges when it comes to divvying up liquidity across many pools with varying TVL.\n\nThe liquidity mining committee and business development teams have been working hard to onboard new strategic partners. Due to this influx of new projects it is becoming increasingly difficult to allocate incentives to new pools without impacting other pools in a meaningful way. This is due to the sizable changes in BAL between tiers. We’ve seen over the past few months that smaller incentive changes lead to better pool retention. As a reminder these are the existing tiers:\n\nTier 1: 15,000 BAL (4 slots, total of 60k BAL per week)\nTier 2: 5,000 BAL (9 slots, total of 45k BAL per week)\nTier 3: 2,500 BAL (12 slots, total of 30k BAL per week)\nTier 4: 1,000 BAL (10 slots, total of 10k BAL per week)\n\nAs you can see above it is a ~70% drop from Tier 1 to Tier 2, 50% drop from Tier 2 to Tier 3, and a 60% drop from Tier 3 to Tier 4. Current setup constraints in BAL allocation do not allow an efficient incentive model for prospective partners of numerous sizes.\n\nAs you may remember there were already two governance votes to switch to a more flexible model, those decisions proved to be successful and allowed the Liquidity Mining Committee to tailor specific allocations to projects depending on pool sizes:\n\n* Introduction of Tier 4 to add flexibility ([link](https://snapshot.org/#/balancer.eth/proposal/QmWiYnwdDynSJ66rt949E5nifh3CtYX6zYxTviiFMbXu3R))\n* Moving Polygon to a fully flexible allocation model ([link](https://snapshot.org/#/balancer.eth/proposal/QmQiatrqfsNZ4eSPCwBwaujBujwzhu2QqHEBSHqEoXs8g5))\n\nThis proposal moves even further in that direction by giving the Liquidity Mining Committee additional flexibility on both Main Net and Arbitrum.\n\n\n**Proposal**\n\n* Keep Tier 1 in place (no changes), any changes to pools in this tier would still require a governance vote.\n* Dissolve Tier 2, 3, and 4 distribution model on Ethereum mainnet and Arbitrum and move to the flexible allocation model that exists on Polygon today. This change will provide the liquidity committee flexibility to allocate the 41,500 BAL ($726,000) on Ethereum mainnet and 8,500 BAL ($148,000) on Arbiturm.\n\nThis increased flexibility will allow the Liquidity Mining Committee to “right size” the incentives for respective pools. This change will ultimately lead to a better BAL per TVL allocation and spread liquidity across many places.\n\nAs a real world example let’s take a look at the LINK/WETH pool that is currently allocated 2,500 BAL. If the Liquidity Committee felt that the BAL allocation was better served elsewhere the pool would be cut by 1,500 BAL if dropped to the next tier. The APR for that pool would drop from ~12% to ~5%. Instead, what if you could trim the BAL by 200, 300, 500, etc. This freedom of flexibility will empower the Liquidity Committee with the ability to “spread the wealth” across our many partners. This change will also allow the Balancer platform to take a step towards a Curve gauge like system in the future if that is ultimately a desire of the community.\n\nThere are no suggested incentive changes for any pools as part of this proposal.\n\n\n**Risks**\n\nWe see no greater risk that Liquidity Committee members could mis-manage rewards than they could with the current structure.\n\nGovernance would continue to have the power to halt the powers of the committee at any time, or remove members from the committee if it deemed such an action appropriate. The need for committee votes to pass changes each week would provide several days for governance to intervene, were such an intervention deemed necessary.",
