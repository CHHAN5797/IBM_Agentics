However, the lessons learned from the Arbitrum launch highlight the importance of coordinated efforts in several key areas:\n\n- Implementing the necessary smart contracts and infrastructure to support GHO on the  network\n- Establishing appropriate risk parameters and collateral requirements specific to the Avalanche ecosystem\n- Integrating GHO with existing DeFi protocols and applications on Avalanche to foster immediate utility\n- Collaborating with the community to ensure a smooth launch and widespread adoption\n\nThese factors underscore the significant effort required from all service providers to create a successful launch. This ARFC vote seeks community approval to proceed with the launch of GHO on Avalanche.\n\n# **Specification**\n\nThe ACI invites all service providers to provide input on their scopes within this proposal. \n\nThe proposed launch of GHO on Avalanche will involve the following key components:\n\n- BGD and Avara to implement and deploy the necessary smart contracts for GHO on the Avalanche network, including cross chain bridge infrastructure and addition to Aave v3 Avalanche.\n- Risk service providers and finance service providers should collaborate on  appropriate risk parameters and collateral requirements tailored to the Avalanche ecosystem. From learnings on Arbitrum launch, ACI suggests a $25m starting bridge cap to allow for growth using the planned programs from the Avalanche ecosystem.\n- ALC will create a plan to bootstrap initial liquidity for GHO on Avalanche, potentially including incentives or partnerships with existing Avalanche protocols.\n- ACI will coordinate with Avalanche ecosystem teams to promote the GHO launch with appropriate support and incentives. The Avalanche ecosystem has [previously signaled](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-rollout-plan-for-cross-chain-gho/17074/5?u=aci) a large commitment to supporting GHO’s launch on the network.\n- ACI will be the Emission Manager for GHO and aGHO potential rewards and incentives.\n- ACI multisig address: `0xac140648435d03f784879cd789130F22Ef588Fcd`\n\nThe exact timeline and detailed technical specifications for each component will be determined by the service providers and presented in subsequent AIPs, pending the approval of this ARFC.\n\n| **Parameter** | **Value** |\n| --- | --- |\n| Asset | GHO |\n| Market | Avalanche |\n| Isolation Mode | No |\n| Borrowable | Yes |\n| Collateral Enabled | No |\n| Supply Cap | 5,000,000 |\n| Borrow Cap | 4,500,000 |\n| Debt Ceiling | - |\n| LTV | - |\n| LT | - |\n| Liquidation Bonus | - |\n| Liquidation Protocol Fee | - |\n| Variable Base | 0% |\n| Variable Slope1 | 12% |\n| Variable Slope2 | 65% |\n| Uoptimal | 90% |\n| Reserve Factor | 10% |\n| Stable Borrowing | Disabled |\n| Flashloanable | Yes |\n| Siloed Borrowing | No |\n| Borrowable in Isolation | No |\n| E-Mode Category | N/A |\n\n## Useful Links\n\n[Avalanche's Proposal on Temp Check: Rollout Plan for Cross-Chain GHO](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-rollout-plan-for-cross-chain-gho/17074/5?u=aci)\n\n# Disclaimer\n\nThe ACI is not presenting this ARFC on behalf of any third party and is not compensated for creating this ARFC.\n\n# Next Steps\n\n1. If consensus is reached on this [ARFC], escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n2. If the ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, service providers will proceed with the appropriate AIPs. \n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.",

However, the lessons learned from the Arbitrum launch highlight the importance of coordinated efforts in several key areas:\n\n- Implementing the necessary smart contracts and infrastructure to support GHO on the  network\n- Establishing appropriate risk parameters and collateral requirements specific to the Base ecosystem\n- Integrating GHO with existing DeFi protocols and applications on Base to foster immediate utility\n- Collaborating with the community to ensure a smooth launch and widespread adoption\n\nThese factors underscore the significant effort required from all service providers to create a successful launch. This ARFC vote seeks community approval to proceed with the launch of GHO on Base.\n\n# **Specification**\n\nThe ACI invites all service providers to provide input on their scopes within this proposal. \n\nThe proposed launch of GHO on Base will involve the following key components:\n\n- BGD and Avara to implement and deploy the necessary smart contracts for GHO on the Base network, including cross chain bridge infrastructure and addition to Aave v3 Base.\n- Risk service providers and finance service providers should collaborate on  appropriate risk parameters and collateral requirements tailored to the Base ecosystem. From learnings on Arbitrum launch, ACI suggests a $25m starting bridge cap to allow for growth using the planned programs from the Base ecosystem.\n- ALC will create a plan to bootstrap initial liquidity for GHO on Base, potentially including incentives or partnerships with existing Base protocols.\n- ACI will coordinate with Base ecosystem teams to promote the GHO launch with appropriate support and incentives. The Base and Optimism ecosystem have provided a large commitment already. The DAO has [previously voted](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0x15cbc6b6c5b4ef76a1fb8cf8747460bf327c459fa01b69907fab0119457939a8) for a continued incentives program and matching of the OP Retroactive Grant, that can be used to launch GHO on Base.\n- ACI will be the Emission Manager for GHO and aGHO potential rewards and incentives.\n- ACI multisig address: `0xac140648435d03f784879cd789130F22Ef588Fcd`\n\nThe exact timeline and detailed technical specifications for each component will be determined by the service providers and presented in subsequent AIPs, pending the approval of this ARFC.\n\n| **Parameter** | **Value** |\n| --- | --- |\n| Asset | GHO |\n| Market | Base |\n| Isolation Mode | No |\n| Borrowable | Yes |\n| Collateral Enabled | No |\n| Supply Cap | 2,500,000 |\n| Borrow Cap | 2,250,000 |\n| Debt Ceiling | - |\n| LTV | - |\n| LT | - |\n| Liquidation Bonus | - |\n| Liquidation Protocol Fee | - |\n| Variable Base | 0% |\n| Variable Slope1 | 12% |\n| Variable Slope2 | 65% |\n| Uoptimal | 90% |\n| Reserve Factor | 10% |\n| Stable Borrowing | Disabled |\n| Flashloanable | Yes |\n| Siloed Borrowing | No |\n| Borrowable in Isolation | No |\n| E-Mode Category | N/A |\n\n## Useful Links\n\n[ARFC: Merit Base incentives and SuperFest matching](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-merit-base-incentives-and-superfest-matching/18450)\n\n# Disclaimer\n\nThe ACI is not presenting this ARFC on behalf of any third party and is not compensated for creating this ARFC.\n\n# Next Steps\n\n1. If consensus is reached on this [ARFC], escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n2. If the ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, service providers will proceed with the appropriate AIPs. \n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.",

As Aave continues its growth across new ecosystems, it presents a strategic opportunity to extend GHO’s reach alongside it. Sonic’s DeFi sector is currently thriving, and with Aave set to launch on Sonic in the coming weeks, deploying GHO there would be a natural next step.\n\nSonic’s current growth is largely driven by the anticipation of its [upcoming airdrop](https://docs.soniclabs.com/funding/sonic-airdrop), scheduled for June. Users earn points while protocols accumulate gems based on their activity within the ecosystem.\n\nA key part of the early GHO growth strategy on Sonic will be securing liquidity in an Aave Boosted StableSurge Pool on Beethoven, a friendly fork of Balancer v3. This integration enables idle liquidity to be automatically redeployed into Aave to maximize capital efficiency. Additionally, as part of Aave’s collaboration with Balancer, these pools will receive further support, with Beethoven allocating a portion of their “gems” rewards to incentivize GHO liquidity.\n\nJust as with the Base deployment, a well-coordinated strategy is crucial for GHO’s expansion to Sonic. A successful launch will require close collaboration among service providers to build a strong infrastructure, establish appropriate risk parameters, and solidify GHO’s role as a key stablecoin within Sonic’s DeFi ecosystem.\n\nThis ARFC vote seeks community consensus to move forward with GHO’s deployment on Sonic, paving the way for its continued multichain growth and deeper integration across emerging ecosystems.\n\n# Specification\n\nThe proposed deployment of GHO on Sonic will require coordination across several key components:\n\n|Service Provider|Responsibility|\n| --- | --- |\n|Aave Labs + BGD + Certora|Deploy CCIP & Aave Protocol Updates|\n|TokenLogic|Deploy Facilitator, GSM & GHO Steward Updates|\n|Chaos Labs + Risk Llama|GSM, CCIP & Aave Protocol Parameters|\n|ACI + TokenLogic|Incentive Program & Distribution|\n|Aave Liquidity Committee|DEX Liquidity|\n|Gho Stewards|Maintain Risk Parameters|\n\nACI multisig address: `0xac140648435d03f784879cd789130F22Ef588Fcd`\n\nThe final timeline and technical specifications for each component will be determined by the service providers and outlined in subsequent AIPs, pending approval of this ARFC.\n\n## Aave Protocol - GHO Reserve Parameters\n\n> Updated proposal 2025-03-15 with Chaos feedback\n\n|Parameter|Value|\n| --- | --- |\n|Asset|GHO|\n|Market|Sonic|\n|Isolation Mode|No|\n|Borrowable|Yes|\n|Collateral Enabled|No|\n|Supply Cap|2,500,000|\n|Borrow Cap|2,250,000|\n|Debt Ceiling|-|\n|LTV|-|\n|LT|-|\n|Liquidation Bonus|-|\n|Liquidation Protocol Fee|-|\n|Variable Base|0%|\n|Variable Slope1|6.5%|\n|Variable Slope2|50%|\n|Uoptimal|90%|\n|Reserve Factor|10%|\n|Stable Borrowing|Disabled|\n|Flashloanable|Yes|\n|Siloed Borrowing|No|\n|Borrowable in Isolation|No|\n|E-Mode Category|N/A|\n\n## Ethereum <> Sonic Facilitator\n\nA facilitator will be deployed on Ethereum specifically to support Sonic.\n\nGHO is considered to have entered circulating supply when users exchange USDC.e for GHO via the stataUSDC.e GSM on Sonic.\n\nThe initial configuration for the Sonic GhoDirectMinter facilitator as shown below:\n\n|Parameter|Value|\n| --- | --- |\n|Mint Cap|10M Units|\n\nThis is to be implemented by setting the `newFacilitatorBucketCapacity` to to 10M.\n\nReference: [GhoDirectMinter](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-bgd-ghodirectminter/20040)\n\n## CCIP Configuration\n\nTo support the launch of GHO on Sonic, the following parameter adjustments are proposed:\n\n|Parameter|Value|\n| --- | --- |\n|Bucket Capacity|+15M Units|\n|Rate Limit Capacity|1,000,000 units|\n|Refill Rate|200 GHO/sec|\n\nThe Bucket increase is additional to the Bucket Capacity at the time to ensure the GSM can be supplied with GHO.\n\nThis is expected to support strong initial growth with the DAO and other expected to be moving large amounts of GHO through the bridge.\n\nReference: [GHO Deployment](https://app.aave.com/governance/v3/proposal/?proposalId=240)\n\n## GSM Configuration\n\nThe below provides the initial configuration of the stataUSDC.e GSM to be deployed on Sonic.\n\n|Parameter|Value|\n| --- | --- |\n|GHO Bucket Cap|10.00M|\n|USDC Exposure Cap|5.00M|\n|Freeze Lower Bound|$0.990|\n|Freeze Upper Bound|$1.010|\n|Unfreeze Lower Bound|$0.995|\n|Unfreeze Upper Bound|$1.005|\n|Mint GHO Fee|0.00%|\n|Burn GHO Fee|0.00%|\n\nWith GHO being minted on Ethereum and being transferred to the GSM, the Mint() function on the Ethereum instance of stataGSM is to be replaced by Transfer() functionality.

Also Risk Parameters added after Risk Service Providers feedback 2025-02-17\n\n---\n\n## Summary\n*--EDITED: removed USDE--*\nThis publication presents the community an opportunity to expand sUSDE integration on the AAVE platform by adding sUSDE collateral option to Base.\n\nsUSDE is an innovative stable-coin derivative producing real yield through perpetual arbitrage and ETH backing yield. \n## Motivation\n\n- Expanding sUSDE integration into Base would allow any size L2 participant to access sUSDE yields while avoiding the expensive gas fees incurred from ETH main-net.\n-Adding sUSDE to Base V3 market would allow Base sUSDE to be used productively through lending. This would facilitate the same 'Borrow USDC/USDT then stake/swap for sUSDE' arbitrage which happens within the ETH V3 main market, but on Base.\n\nEthena lacks strong foundations on Base L2 for their native yieldbearing stable-coin, sUSDE. The addition of sUSDE to Base V3 AAVE market would facilitate this expansion to the untapped L2 market for Ethena.\n\nBase has seen expansion in its TVL now surpassing Arbitrum by ~15%. Base chain is a small but significant part of total Defi TVL (all chains) of 3%.\nSource: https://defillama.com/chains\n\nUpdated price feeds for USDE and sUSDE could mean one or both will not have to be added to Base V3 in an isolated market.\n\n## Specification\n\nTicker: USDE and sUSDE\nUSDE L2 Contract Address: [0x5d3a1Ff2b6BAb83b63cd9AD0787074081a52ef34]\n(https://basescan.org/address/0x5d3a1Ff2b6BAb83b63cd9AD0787074081a52ef34)\nsUSDE L2 Contract Address: [0x211Cc4DD073734dA055fbF44a2b4667d5E5fE5d2]\n(https://basescan.org/address/0x211Cc4DD073734dA055fbF44a2b4667d5E5fE5d2)\n\n> Risk Parameters updated 2025-02-17\n\n**sUSDe Market Configuration (Base Instance)**\n\n| **Parameter** | **Value** |\n| --- | --- |\n| Isolation Mode | No |\n| Borrowable | No |\n| Collateral Enabled | Yes |\n| Supply Cap | 1,200,000 |\n| Borrow Cap | - |\n| Debt Ceiling | - |\n| LTV | 70.00% |\n| LT | 73.00% |\n| Liquidation Bonus | 8.50% |\n| Liquidation Protocol Fee | 10.00% |\n| Variable Base | - |\n| Variable Slope1 | - |\n| Variable Slope2 | - |\n| Uoptimal | - |\n| Reserve Factor | - |\n| Stable Borrowing | Disabled |\n| Flashloanable | No |\n| Borrowable in Isolation | No |\n| E-Mode Category | Stablecoin |\n\n**sUSDe Liquid E-mode Configuration**\n\n| **Parameter** | **Value** | **Value** | **Value** |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Asset | sUSDe | GHO | USDC |\n| Collateral | Yes | No | No |\n| Borrowable | No | Yes | Yes |\n| Max LTV | 88% | - | - |\n| Liquidation Threshold | 90% | - | - |\n| Liquidation Bonus | 4.0% | - | - |\n\n## Useful Links\n\nProject: https://ethena.fi/\nDocs: https://docs.ethena.fi/solution-design/key-addresses\n\n### Disclaimer\n\nThe current proposal has been edited by ACI, under Skywards.

KyberSwap has already been deployed on 14 chains, including Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, Avalanche, and Base. Total trading volume has crossed $21B+ and the current total value locked (TVL) on all chains is $60M+.\n\nKNC is Kyber’s utility and governance token and an important part of KyberSwap operations. KNC holders can stake KNC to vote on proposals to improve KyberSwap. In return, KNC voters receive rewards from fees collected through trading on KyberSwap and other ecosystem collaborations. As more trades are executed and new protocols are added, more rewards are generated.\n\nAdding support for KNC on Ethereum V3 in isolated mode would allow KNC holders to borrow stablecoins by leveraging their KNC position, attracting new KNC deposits, which would add a new revenue stream for Aave while limiting the exposure.\n\n# Specification:\n\nWe propose the following parameters according to [Gauntlet](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-add-knc-to-ethereum-aave-v3/14824/6?u=alice) and [ChaosLabs's recommendations](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-add-knc-to-ethereum-aave-v3/14824/6#overview-1):\n\n| Parameter | Value |\n| --- | --- |\n| Isolation Mode | Yes |\n| Borrowable | Yes |\n| Collateral Enabled | Yes |\n| Supply Cap (KNC) | 1.200.000 |\n| Borrow Cap (KNC) | 650,000 |\n| Debt Ceiling | 1M$ |\n| LTV | 35.00% |\n| LT | 40.00% |\n| Liquidation Bonus | 10.00% |\n| Liquidation protocol Fee | 10.00% |\n| Variable Base | 0.00% |\n| Variable Slope1 | 9.00% |\n| Variable Slope2 | 300.00% |\n| Uoptimal | 45.00% |\n| Reserve Factor | 20.00% |\n| Stable Borrowing | Disabled |\n| Stable Slope1 | 13.00% |\n| Stable Slope2 | 300.00% |\n| Base Stable Rate Offset | 3.00% |\n| Stable Rate Excess Offset | 5.00% |\n| Optimal Stable To Total Debt Ratio | 20.00% |\n| Flahloanable | Yes |\n| Siloed Borrowing | No |\n| Borrowed in Isolation | No |\n- **Ticker:** KNC\n- **Contract Address:** [0xdeFA4e8a7bcBA345F687a2f1456F5Edd9CE97202](https://etherscan.io/address/0xdeFA4e8a7bcBA345F687a2f1456F5Edd9CE97202)\n- **Chainlink Oracle:** [0xf8ff43e991a81e6ec886a3d281a2c6cc19ae70fc](https://etherscan.io/address/0xf8ff43e991a81e6ec886a3d281a2c6cc19ae70fc)\n\n# Disclaimer:\n\nThis proposal is powered by Skyward.\n\nThe author isn’t compensated by KyberSwap for this ARFC.\n\n# Next step:\n\nThe following steps are as follow:\n\n- gather community feedback and @Gauntlet recommendations on this ARFC.\n- Publish a snapshot of the risk providers' recommendations.\n- If said snapshot is successful, escalate to an AIP.\n\n# Copyright:\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",
