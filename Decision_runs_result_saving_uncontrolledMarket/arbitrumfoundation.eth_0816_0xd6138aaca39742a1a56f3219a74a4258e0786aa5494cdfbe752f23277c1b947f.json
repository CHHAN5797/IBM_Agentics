        "body": "Request Non-Emergency Security Council Action\nAbstract\nThe transaction fee paid by users is composed of two parts, L2 fees and L1 fees, which together include the execution cost for running the transaction on Arbitrum alongside the cost of posting data to Ethereum (to learn more about this, read the deep dive on the subject 1).\n\nHistorically, the rollup fee market has been dominated by the L1 cost component. With the Dencun upgrade soon being enabled on Ethereum, the current pricing structure may no longer be optimal. The ArbOS Version 20 “Atlas” upgrade is a step towards better consuming the new data availability affordances offered by Ethereum, but will also potentially require further adjustment once EIP-4844 has been deployed and tested.\n\nThere was an oversight during the ArbOS Version 20 “Atlas” upgrade where two configuration should be updated for users when the Dencun upgrade occurs:\n\nL1 surplus fee. Reduce the surplus fee per byte from 32 gwei to 0.\nL2 base fee. Reduce the minimum from 0.1 gwei to 0.01 gwei.\nIn both cases, the configuration changes will match what is currently implemented in Arbitrum Nova. As evidenced by the recent surge of transactions in Arbitrum Nova, the network can handle the increased transaction throughput while offering lower fees for users in general under that configuration.\n\nImpact on the ArbitrumDAO’s revenue\nThe L2 base fee change will impact the revenue received by the ArbitrumDAO. The potential impact based on the past 30 days of activity was calculated, which if the changes had been implemented (ignoring potential changes in demand based on lower fees), would have resulted in overall profit going from 816.13 ETH → 79.89 ETH\n\nWhile the fee reduction will result in lower revenue for the ArbitrumDAO in the short term, it will ensure that the Arbitrum One network continues to offer competitive costs to its users and in turn it can lead to an increase in transaction traffic.\n\nSince the parameter change affects the revenue generated, it is important to carry out a temperature check for the ArbitrumDAO to discuss and ultimately vote on the change. If it is approved by the ArbitrumDAO, then the Security Council will be requested to initiate a non-emergency action to execute the configuration change. The goal is to ensure the fees are changed as soon as possible in line with the Decun upgrade.\n\nImplementation details\nThe following configured values will be changed in the ArbOwner smart contract that can be viewed in Contract Address 0x000000000000000000000000000000000000006b | Arbiscan.\n\nThe following governance action smart contracts will be used to initiate the action:\n\nArbOneSetAtlasL1PricingRewardAction | Address 0x36D0170D92F66e8949eB276C3AC4FEA64f83704d | Arbiscan\nArbOneSetAtlasMinBaseFeeAction | Address 0x849E360a247132F961c9CBE95Ba39106c72e1268 | Arbiscan\nThe security council will separate the two parameter change actions to enable the ArbitrumDAO to decide whether to accept one, both, or neither. The ability to decide will be reflected on Snapshot using a ranked voting with the following options:\n\nSet L1 surplus fee and L2 minimum base fee.\nSet only L1 surplus fee.\nSet only L2 minimum base fee.\nSet neither option and cancel security council action.\nTimeline\nThe ArbOS v20 “Atlas” upgrade is due to be activated on the 14th of March, and the following schedule will be pursued to address the configuration issues in a timely manner:\n\n5th March - Temperature Vote on Snapshot\n5th March - Initiate non-emergency security council action\n18th March - Activate configuration change to reduce fees\nA non-emergency security council action is viewed as ideal as it exists primarily to approve and implement routine software upgrades, routine maintenance and other parameter adjustments in a non-emergency setting.\n\nTemperature check: Snapshot 3\nSecurity council transaction: [update shortly]\n\nTaking this route will mean that Arbitrum One network will have higher than anticipated fees for 5 days.\n\nThe following governance calls will also enable the community to discuss the technical changes:\n\n6th March - Wednesday at 6pm EST\n7th March - Thursday at 9am EST\nBoth calls will be added to the governance call and more calls can be arranged if necessary.",

        "body": "This Snapshot vote aims to solicit a temperature check from the ArbitrumDAO on their stance for bringing the BoLD upgrade to Arbitrum One and Nova. BoLD is a new dispute resolution protocol that unlocks permissionless validation for Arbitrum chains and enhances their security by mitigating the risk of delay attacks.\n\nFor more information, please refer to the original [BoLD AIP Forum Post](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-bold-permissionless-validation-for-arbitrum/23232) where you will find public audit reports, the BoLD whitepaper (that contain the formal specification and safety proofs), as well as further explanations of how BoLD works (including an overview of BoLD’s economics, spam prevention, rewards, reimbursements and penalties) and its proposed design for Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova.\n\n## Constitutional Proposal\n\n## Abstract\n\nThis Constitutional AIP proposes upgrading Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova’s Rollup Contracts to use Arbitrum BoLD and to support a new challenger manager contract on Ethereum. Arbitrum BoLD is a new dispute resolution protocol that’s designed to replace the existing and currently deployed Arbitrum protocol. If the upgrade is approved, then validators on Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova can use the Nitro software to participate in BoLD. BoLD delivers two critical improvements:\n- Unlocks permissionless validation for Arbitrum chains,\n- Enhances the security of Arbitrum chains by mitigating the risk of [delay attacks](https://medium.com/offchainlabs/solutions-to-delay-attacks-on-rollups-434f9d05a07a).\n\nBoLD accomplishes this feat by ensuring that any single honest party can always successfully defend against malicious claims to an Arbitrum chain’s state. BoLD represents the next step on the journey to having the Arbitrum technology stack being recognized as a [Stage 2 Ethereum rollup](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/proposed-milestones-for-rollups-taking-off-training-wheels/11571). The implementation of BoLD will be thoroughly tested to ensure both its effectiveness and safety. The testing plan includes:\n- A comprehensive [audit by Trail of Bits](https://github.com/trailofbits/publications/blob/master/reviews/2024-04-offchainbold-securityreview.pdf),\n- Deployment of the protocol to public testnets for at least 8 weeks,\n- A public [audit program](https://code4rena.com/audits/2024-05-arbitrum-bold),\n- [Publication of mathematical safety proofs and formal specifications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10491).\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe ArbitrumDAO should consider approving this AIP as BoLD delivers critical security and decentralization improvements for Arbitrum One and Nova that benefit all Arbitrum users, Arbitrum node operators, dApps on Arbitrum, and Arbitrum bridges. These benefits can be extended to any Orbit chain that wishes to adopt BoLD.\n\nMore specifically, this new dispute resolution protocol brings the following benefits to Arbitrum chains:\n- Permissionless validation\n- Fixed delay time for assertion confirmation\n- Security Council Safety-First Approach\n\nMore details on these benefits can be found in the [Motivation section of the original proposal](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-bold-permissionless-validation-for-arbitrum/23232#motivation-2).\n\n## Rationale\n\nEnabling permissionless validation has been a long-term goal of Arbitrum on the [progressive journey towards decentralization](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/state-of-progressive-decentralization).\n\nBoLD mitigates the risk of delay attacks on Optimistic Rollups by ensuring challenges can be resolved within a fixed time period as long as there is an honest party involved. This particular change unlocks permissionless validation, enabling any well-resourced honest party or parties to defend and protect Arbitrum from malicious actors.\n\nMore details on the community values that this proposal supports, can be found in the [Rationale section of the original proposal](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-bold-permissionless-validation-for-arbitrum/23232#rationale-3).\n\n## Implementation, Formal Specification, and Safety Proofs\n\nThe following link, [BoLD Implementation Deep Dive](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/bold/blob/main/docs/research-specs/TechnicalDeepDive.pdf), explains how BoLD is implemented and how it works at a high level. To read about the formal specifications and mathematical safety proofs for the protocol, check out the [official BoLD whitepaper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10491).\n\n## Economics of Disputes, including the cost to participate, rewards, and penalties\n\nThe economics behind BoLD are carefully researched and designed to optimize for the security of the protocol while keeping costs reasonable for honest parties. More details on this topic can be found in the [Economics section of the original proposal](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-bold-permissionless-validation-for-arbitrum/23232#overview-of-bolds-economics-and-spam-prevention-5) and this short paper on the [Economics of Disputes in BoLD](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/bold/blob/main/docs/research-specs/Economics.pdf). \n\n## Technical Risks\n\nSome of the technical risks of the BoLD upgrade include:\n- Issues preventing liveness of challenges due to smart contract bugs in the new contracts. For instance, no honest validator able to make a move when it should be able to;\n- Safety issues where a malicious party is able to game the system and win due to logic errors in smart contracts;\n- Logic bugs in the assertion smart contracts that could affect assertion confirmation and posting, which could delay withdrawals until it is fixed; and\n- Bugs in bonding logic in the smart contracts that could lead to loss of funds due to logic errors in the Arbitrum Rollup and challenge manager smart contracts.\n\nRisks that remain the same between the current Arbitrum Rollup protocol and BoLD:\n- Bugs in the one step proof logic: BoLD does not change how one step proofs work for Arbitrum chains.\n\n## Timeline and steps to implement BoLD for Arbitrum One and Nova\n\nBelow is a list of initiatives to ensure the new BoLD dispute resolution protocol is ready to be reviewed and voted on by the ArbitrumDAO for adoption in Arbitrum One and Nova. Feedback from the community and any findings from testing will be collected and used to inform decisions and evolve BoLD along the way.\n\n1. Deployment of a public testnet with BoLD validators for a minimum of 4 weeks\n  a. Check out this guide on [how to deploy a BoLD validator on the testnet](https://github.com/offchainlabs/bold-validator-starter-kit) to begin testing out permissionless validation using Arbitrum technology!\n2. The submission of the AIP in the format of a [forum post](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-bold-permissionless-validation-for-arbitrum/23232).\n3. [Audit of the protocol’s implementation by Trail of Bits](https://github.com/trailofbits/publications/blob/master/reviews/2024-04-offchainbold-securityreview.pdf)\n4. Hosting of governance calls to talk about BoLD to answer questions from the community about BoLD and this AIP.\n5. This formal temperature check proposal to activate BoLD on Arbitrum’s Sepolia for a minimum of 4 weeks, be made via a Snapshot vote.\n6. Kick-start a [public audit program](https://code4rena.com/audits/2024-05-arbitrum-bold).\n7. Finalize pre-mainnet requirements, including:\n  a. Publication of BoLD migration documentation for existing validators;\n  b. Deployment of a monitoring stack to view on-going challenges on an Arbitrum chain; and\n  c. Publication of a formal procedure for The Arbitrum Foundation to handle L1 gas costs reimbursements for honest parties.\n8. Formal AIP gets submitted to Tally.\n9. Should the formal on-chain proposal pass, BoLD will activate on Arbitrum One and Nova.\n\n## Overall Cost\n\nThere is no cost for this proposal to the ArbitrumDAO as Offchain Labs, Inc. will incur all engineering and audit costs to complete the implementation of BoLD and get this new dispute resolution protocol into a mainnet-ready state. Currently, future development work for BoLD is expected to also be undertaken by Offchain Labs, Inc.\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThe confirmation timing on any withdrawal that is in-flight when the proposed BoLD upgrade is activated will be delayed until the first BoLD assertion is confirmed. This means that for any Arbitrum chain that upgrades to use BoLD, including Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova, all pending withdrawals to L1 Ethereum that were initiated before the upgrade will be delayed by 1 challenge period, plus the time between the withdrawal was initiated and the time that the BoLD upgrade takes place. This is because the upgrade effectively “resets” the challenge period for that are not yet finalized.\n\n## FAQ\n\nFor additional topics & questions, please visit the BoLD specific FAQ document [here](https://www.notion.so/arbitrumfoundation/Arbitrum-BoLD-FAQ-93210f430a6a470792496be040ac9990).",

        "body": "## Constitutional Proposal\n\n## Abstract\n\nThis AIP outlines a path toward activating Stylus on Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova. Stylus is an upgrade that introduces a new virtual machine that runs alongside the EVM. This enables developers to write smart contracts in new programming languages, like Rust, that are more efficient than Solidity smart contracts.\n\n## Motivation\n\nStylus is a first-of-its-kind technology resulting from breakthrough engineering efforts in the Arbitrum ecosystem. Unlike other alternative VMs, Stylus is purely additive to the EVM. This means that Stylus contracts and EVM contracts are fully interoperable.\n\nSome defining features of Stylus include:\n\n- Preferred Languages: There are [estimated](https://research.slashdata.co/reports/65b90140343d024fbe70f369) to be roughly 20k Solidity developers, compared to 3.5 million Rust developers and 10 million C++ developers. Developers can use their preferred programming language, all interoperable with each other, on any Arbitrum chain with Stylus. Scaling to the next billion users requires onboarding the next million developers.\n- EVM+: Stylus brings the best of both worlds. Developers still get all of the benefits of the EVM, including the ecosystem and liquidity, while getting efficiency improvements and access to existing libraries in Rust, C, and C++ — without changing anything about how the EVM works. EVM equivalence is no longer the ceiling; it’s the floor.\n- Cheaper Execution: Stylus is a more efficient execution environment than the EVM, leading directly to gas savings for complex smart contracts. Computation can be over 10x cheaper, and memory can be over 100x cheaper. Cryptography libraries can be deployed as custom application layer precompiles, permissionlessly. Use cases that are impractical in the EVM are now possible in Stylus.\n- Safer By Design: Stylus doesn’t just improve on cost and speed. WASM programs are also safer. Reentrancy is a common vulnerability that developers can only attempt to mitigate in Solidity. Stylus provides cheap reentrancy detection, and using the Rust SDK, reentrancy is disabled by default, unless intentionally overridden.\n- Fully Interoperable: Solidity programs and WASM programs are completely composable. If working in Solidity, a developer can call a Rust program or rely on another dependency in a different language. If working in Rust, all Solidity functionalities are accessible out of the box. This means your Rust smart contracts can rely on primitives and infrastructure (such as oracles) that were built using Solidity.\n\nSeveral exciting teams have been building their apps on the Stylus testnet for the past few months. These apps would simply not be possible on Arbitrum without the added efficiency or new language support. Stylus can onboard (1) the next generation of developers from alternate VM ecosystems and (2) new use cases that users cannot experience on EVM chains.\n\n## Rationale\n\nThis proposal is aligned with the Arbitrum community’s mission and values:\n- Ethereum-Aligned: Stylus does not change anything about how the EVM works. Rather than replacing, Stylus is completely additive and extends what is possible in the EVM.\n- Sustainable: More efficiency at the execution layer can give Arbitrum chains long-term competitive advantages by allowing higher throughput, cheaper costs, and new use cases that are not possible on other EVM chains.\n- Accessibility: Arbitrum can become the home for new types of developers who don’t know Solidity. This includes Rust, C, C++, and any other programming language that compiles to WebAssembly.\n- Inclusivity: The Stylus SDK is 100% open-source, meaning developers are free to fork, modify, and contribute to the core patterns that the SDK represents.\n- Empowerment: The parameters defined in Stylus are fully configurable by the Arbitrum DAO (for Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova) and individual Orbit chains. These customizations can supercharge Stylus by, for example, dropping activation prices, increasing contract size limits, and lowering opcode pricing.\n\n## Key Terms\n\nStylus: A new programming environment, including a WebAssembly-based virtual machine, a CLI, and a canonical SDK that defines the patterns and frameworks for writing smart contracts.\n\nWebAssembly (WASM): WebAssembly is a modern binary format used in significant web standards, browsers, and companies to speed up computation. Built to be fast, portable, and secure.\n\nVirtual Machine (VM): The software that executes smart contracts and processes transactions.\n\n## Specifications\n\nThe Stylus VM and fraud prover have been developed as a fork of the Nitro codebase. These repositories will be merged into the main branch of Nitro if the Arbitrum DAO approves the AIP:\n\nThe Stylus VM and fraud prover have been developed as a fork of the Nitro codebase. These repositories will be merged into the main branch of Nitro if the Arbitrum DAO approves the AIP:\n\n- stylus: [GitHub - OffchainLabs/stylus](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/stylus)\n  - Fork of [GitHub - OffchainLabs/nitro](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro)\n  - Includes node software, VM, and Fraud Prover\n- stylus-geth: [GitHub - OffchainLabs/stylus-geth](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/stylus-geth)\n  - Fork of [GitHub - OffchainLabs/go-ethereum](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/go-ethereum)\n  - Includes the execution client and databases\n- stylus-contracts: [GitHub - OffchainLabs/stylus-contracts](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/stylus-contracts)\n  - Fork of [GitHub - OffchainLabs/nitro-contracts](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro-contracts)\n  - Includes rollup and fraud proof smart contracts\n\nThe Stylus VM is not a replacement for the EVM. Instead, the two VMs work together to facilitate state transitions, each playing their part in executing their respective bytecode. EVM contracts written in Solidity still use Geth’s EVM exactly as before, ensuring EVM equivalence. In other words, Stylus is entirely additive — a paradigm called EVM+.\n\nStylus contracts can be written using the Stylus SDK, which employs Solidity-equivalent ABIs and storage patterns to ensure cross-language interoperability. For example, existing Solidity DEXs can list Rust tokens without modification. New SDKs for additional programming languages can be added over time. Current SDK repositories:\n\n- Rust SDK: [GitHub - OffchainLabs/stylus-sdk-rs: Rust Smart Contracts on Arbitrum](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/stylus-sdk-rs)\n- C/C++ SDK: [GitHub - OffchainLabs/stylus-sdk-c: C/C++ Smart Contracts on Arbitrum](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/stylus-sdk-c)\n- Stylus CLI: [GitHub - OffchainLabs/cargo-stylus: Cargo subcommand for developing Arbitrum Stylus projects in Rust](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/cargo-stylus)\n\nIf you would like to better understand the lifecycle of a Stylus contract, head over to [A Gentle Introduction: Stylus](https://docs.arbitrum.io/stylus/stylus-gentle-introduction).\n\nThere are some relevant components of Stylus that are listed below:\n\n- Host I/Os\n- The Memory Model\n- Dynamic Learning\n- Activation Pricing\n- Opcode Pricing\n\nMore details on these components can be found in the corresponding [forum post](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-activate-stylus-and-enable-next-gen-webassembly-smart-contracts-arbos-30/22970), which is also linked below.\n\n## Steps to Implement\n\nIf the Arbitrum DAO approves the AIP, the path would consist of:\n\n1. Discussion of the proposal on the forum\n2. Completing the audit and remaining code changes\n3. Merging the Stylus branch into the canonical Nitro codebase\n4. A vote on Snapshot to enable Stylus on Arbitrum Sepolia\n5. Sufficient time for testing on a public testnet that emulates production environments\n6. An onchain vote to deploy the upgrade on Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova\n\n## Timeline\n\nStylus is rapidly progressing toward being production-ready. Once it is, ideally the upgrade can take place on Arbitrum Sepolia, and Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova afterwards. An onchain vote for this AIP will only occur once there is a public audit report.\n\nNOTE:\nIf this vote passes on Snapshot, the tentative plan is to upgrade Arbitrum Sepolia to ArbOS 30 the week of June 10th.\n\nIf Arbitrum Sepolia upgrades to ArbOS 30, there will be an ecosystem-wide plan to ensure non-breaking compatibility of infrastructure and applications with Stylus, which will take several weeks or months. The ultimate goal is that the experience for EVM developers remains as unchanged as possible if ArbOS reaches mainnet. Once enough confidence is reached, there will be an onchain vote to upgrade Arbitrum One and Nova to ArbOS 30. The Arbitrum community will be informed of any significant updates as they arise.",

        "body": "Category: Constitutional - Process\nAs part of its governance, the Arbitrum DAO incorporates a Security Council that can take certain emergency and non-emergency actions:\n\nSection 3 of the Constitution 10 describes this council in more detail.\nInitial Setup Transparency Report 3 details the current members of the council.\nSection 4 on the Constitution outlines an election process that will replace six security council members every six months.\nThe first election to replace the first cohort of Security Council Members is expected to begin on the 15th September.\n\nExecutive summary\nThis vote relates to the enactment of the Arbitrum Security Council elections.\nA smart contract system has been developed to enable on-chain voting. That system is final and under multiple security audits.\nThis vote is meant to temperature check with the DAO both the process that will be conducted for the elections, as well as the smart contract system that will enable them.\nA successful vote will lead to an on-chain proposal that updates the constitution text with the new sections below, as well as the new Security Council election system being activated within the broader Arbitrum governance architecture.\nImplementation Status\nThe code representing the proposed architecture is currently under audit and is available for full review in: GitHub - ArbitrumFoundation/governance at c18de53820c505fc459f766c1b224810eaeaabc5.\n\nThe work has already been audited by Trail of Bits and the identified issues have been patched in, the full audit report will be made available in the codebase soon. A Code4Rena audit competition has also been commissioned for the election system and can be viewed at Code4rena | Keeping high severity bugs out of production\n\nBackground\nAn overview of the election process as described by the Constitution alongside the process for how to enact a code change to Arbitrum’s smart contract suite:\n\nConstitution of the Arbitrum DAO 2 (esp. sections 3 10 and 4) - As noted above, this proposal seeks to enact what is already described in the Constitution.\nDAO Governance Architecture 5 - The proposed architecture makes use of a number of existing governance components.\nAn understanding of the following smart contract suites will help the reader evaluate this proposal as it re-uses several components:\n\nOpen Zeppelin Governor - The proposed architecture inherits a number of OpenZeppelin contracts.\nGnosis Modules 1 - Each of the security councils is a Gnosis Safe, and updating members of the security council is handled via adding Gnosis modules.\nHigh-level Election Overview\nThe Constitution specifies that membership of the Security Council is split into two cohorts. Every 6 months, all positions in a single cohort are put up for election.\n\nThe proposed election implementation, which must adhere to the specification laid out in the Constitution, is split into:\n\nElection stages: The process for selecting and voting for nominees.\nUpdate stages: Installing the newly elected cohort into the Arbitrum smart contracts.\nThe election process and update stages are performed via on-chain smart contracts. A brief overview of each stage includes:\n\nElection Stages\nProcess for selecting and voting for the new cohort of Security council members.\n\nNominee selection (7 days). Candidates must gain 0.2% of total votable tokens in order to make it to the next step.\nCompliance check by Foundation (14 days). As dictated in the Constitution, the selected nominees must undergo a compliance check to ensure they comply with the legal requirements, service agreements, and additional rules dictated by the Constitution.\nMember election (21 days). Votes are cast and the top 6 nominees are selected.\nUpdate Stages\nProcess to install the newly elected cohort of Security Council members into the Arbitrum smart contracts.\n\nSecurity Council manager update (0 days). The manager is the source of truth for specifying who are the current council members. It processes the election result and takes note on who will be the new security council members.\nL2 timelock + withdrawal + L1 timelock (3 + 7 + 3 days). All actions that directly affect the core Arbitrum contracts must go through a series of timelocks to protect the right for all users to exit. This is a built-in safety mechanism for users who are unhappy with the approved changes.\nIndividual council update (0 days). Once the updates have passed through the relevant timelocks, the Security Council manager can install the security council members. This requires updating 4 Gnosis Safe smart contracts that are controlled by the Security Council members.\nSecurity Council Election Flow\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreia2bk2mmknletnshsvxbohkbszppbkb3wdntpnraj7x2gwgx2rgqq)\n    \nElection Stages in detail\n1. Nominee selection (7 days)\nThis stage consists of handling election timing, candidate registration, candidate endorsement:\n\nElection creation. Elections can be created by anyone, but only every 6 months. The election alternates between targeting the positions on the two cohorts. Once created, this first stage of the election process lasts for 7 days.\nCandidate registration. During these 7 days, any candidate can register, unless they are already a member of the other cohort. Members of the current cohort (the cohort up for election) are allowed to register for re-election.\nEndorsing candidates. Delegates can endorse a candidate during this 7 day window. A single delegate can split their vote across multiple candidates. No candidate can accrue more than 0.2% of all votable tokens.\nFallback in case of too few candidates. In the event that fewer than 6 candidates receive a 0.2% endorsement, outgoing members of the cohort up for election will be selected to make up to 6 candidates.\nImplementation details\nThe nominee selection process is implemented by the SecurityCouncilNomineeElectionGovernor contract.\n\nIt inherits most of its functionality from the Open Zeppelin Governor contracts and we have extended it with an extra feature:\n\nCustom counting module to allow delegates to endorse multiple candidates.\nThe governor contract has the following characteristics:\n\nA new proposal is created each election cycle, with an identifier unique to that election cycle.\nCandidates can the put themselves forward by calling addContender.\nDelegates can call castVoteWithReasonAndParams, supplying custom arguments in the params to indicate which candidate they wish to endorse with what weight.\n2. Compliance check by the Foundation(14 days)\nThe Foundation will be given 14 days to vet the prospective nominees. If they find that a candidate does not meet the compliance check, they can exclude the candidate from progressing to the next stage. Note that grounds for exclusion could include greater than 3 members of a given organisation being represented in the nominee set (as described in section 4 of the Constitution).\n\nImplementation details\nThe foundation can exclude a nominee by:\n\nCalling a custom excludeNominee function on the same SecurityCouncilNomineeElectionGovernor contract.\nThe Governor smart contract enforces the 2 week time period and the Foundation must exclude nominees by this deadline.\n\nOnce the compliance check has completed:\n\nAnyone can call the execute function on the SecurityCouncilNomineeElectionGovernor to proceed to the member election stage.\nIf there are less than 6 eligible nominees, then the Foundation will consult with outgoing members of the cohort on whether they will continue in this role for another 12 months. Members of the existing cohort may be selected at random to fill the remaining seats.\n\n3. Member election (21 days)\nThe voting process can begin once a set of compliant candidates have been successfully nominated.\n\nThe voting process is designed to encourage voters to cast their vote early. Their voting power will eventually decay if they do not cast their vote within the first 7 days:\n\n0 - 7 days. Votes cast will carry weight 1 per token\n7 - 21 days. Votes cast will have their weight linearly decreased based on the amount of time that has passed since the 7 day point. By the 21st day, each token will carry a weight of 0.\nAdditionally, delegates can cast votes for more than one nominee:\n\nSplit voting. delegates can split their tokens across multiple nominees, with 1 token representing 1 vote.\nImplementation details\nThe Security Council member election will take place in a separate SecurityCouncilMemberElectionGovernor contract which will also inherit from Open Zeppelin Governor contracts.\n\nAfter the 14 day waiting period for the compliance check, anyone can trigger a new member election:\n\nCall the execute function in SecurityCouncilNomineeElectionGovernor to deploy a new election proposal for SecurityCouncilMemberElectionGovernor\nThe SecurityCouncilMemberElectionGovernor includes:\n\nA custom counting module that allows delegates to split their vote and accounts for the linear decrease in voting weight.\nThese additional parameters are supplied as the params argument when calling castVoteWithReasonAndParams.\nThe custom counting module also checks that the nominee being voted is a compliant one by checking against the compliant nominee list in the SecurityCouncilNomineeElectionGovernor.\nAt the end of the 21 days of election:\n\nAnyone can call the execute function on the SecurityCouncilMemberElectionGovernor contract to initiate the update of top 6 nominees with the most votes into SecurityCouncilManager.\nUpdate stages in detail\n1. Security Council manager update\nThe security council manager is a contract which contains the canonical list of security council members, and which cohort they are part of. When a member election completes, the manager updates its local list of the current cohorts then forms cross chain messages to propagate those updates to each of the Security Council Gnosis safes.\n\nThe manager also provides some additional functionality to allow the security council to:\n\nRemove a member: As described in the Constitution, the council can remove one of its own members. The DAO can also remove a member under special conditions described by the Constitution.\nAdd a member: After removing a member, the council can add a member\nAddress rotation: As a practical matter, a council member can rotate one of their own keys. This can only be done with the approval of at least 9/12 council members as well as explicit approval from the member carrying out the rotation.\nImplementation details\nThe manager functionality is contained within a custom SecurityCouncilManager smart contract. Since the SecurityCouncilManager is indirectly able to make calls to the standard UpgradeExecutor contracts which have far reaching powers, special care must be take to ensure the manager only makes council member updates.\n\nCalling the UpgradeExecutors on each of the chains requires navigating withdrawals transactions, timelocks and inboxes, the SecurityCouncilManager outsources the calldata creation for these routes to a UpgradeExecRouteBuilder contract.\n\n2. Timelocks and withdrawal\nConstitutional DAO proposals all pass through:\n\nL2 timelock (3 days),\nL2 → L1 withdrawal (~7 days),\nL1 timelock (3 days).\nYou can read more about these stages in the governance docs 1. The purpose of these delays is to ensure that users wishing to withdraw their assets before the proposal is executed will have the time to do so. Changing the Security Council members should also provide this guarantee, so after the election has completed and before the Security Councils are updated the update message also goes through these same stages. The update message will use the existing timelocks to enforce these delays.\n\nImplementation details\nThe existing governance timelock contracts are used as part of this flow.\n\nThe SecurityCouncilManager is given the PROPOSER role on the L2 timelock enabling it to create messages that will eventually be received by each UpgradeExecutor.\n\n3. Individual council updates\nThe new Security Council members need to be installed into 4 Gnosis safes:\n\nArbitrum One 9 of 12 Emergency Security Council\nArbitrum One 7 of 12 Non-Emergency Security Council\nEthereum 9 of 12 Emergency Security Council\nNova 9 of 12 Emergency Security Council\nThe old cohort of members will be removed, and the new cohort will replace them.\n\nImplementation details\nTo do this the existing Upgrade Executor contracts on each chain will be installed as Gnosis Safe modules into the Security Council safes. A custom Governance Action Contract 2 will be used to call the specific OwnerManager addOwnerWithThreshold and removeOwner methods on the Gnosis safes.\n\nAdditional affordances\nThe Constitution also declares some other additional affordances to certain parties\n\nThe DAO can vote to remove a member prior to the end of their term, as long as 10% of possible votes are cast in favour and 5/6 of cast votes are in favour. This will be implemented as a governor with correct quorum and proposal passed thresholds. This governor will be given the rights to call removeMember on the SecurityCouncilManager.\nThe Security Council can remove a member prior to the end of their term, if 9 of 12 members agree. The 9 of 12 council will be given the rights to call removeMember on the SecurityCouncilManager.\nThe Security Council can add a member once one has been removed, if 9 of 12 members agree and if there are less than 12 members currently on the council. The 9 of 12 council will be given the rights to call addMember on the SecurityCouncilManager.\nConstitution Updates\nThe proposed implementation mostly satisfies the specification outlined by the Arbitrum Constitution. There are some minor changes that are required to the Constitution’s text to take into account the time it takes to install new candidates and to support compliance procedures set out by the Arbitrum Foundation.\n\nNote, the final wording for how to update the Constitution will be provided in a later revision. We simply want to notify the requirement that the text needs to be changed. At this stage, our request for feedback is focused on the implementation details of the smart contract suite.\n\nUpdate timeline for the election\nThe Section 4 of the Constitution contains the text:\n\nFrom T until T+7 days: Any DAO member may declare their candidacy for the Security Council; provided that a current Security Council member in one cohort may not be a candidate for a seat in the other cohort. To the extent that there are more than six candidates, each eligible candidate must be supported by pledged votes representing at least 0.2% of all Votable Tokens. In the event that fewer than six candidates are supported by pledged votes representing at least 0.2% of all Votable Tokens, the current Security Council members whose seats are up for election may become candidates (as randomly selected out of their Cohort) until there are 6 candidates.\n\nFrom T+7 days until T+28 days: Each DAO member or delegate may vote for any declared candidate. Each token may be cast for one candidate. Votes cast before T+14 days will have 100% weight. Votes cast between T+14 days and T+28 days will have weight based on the time of casting, decreasing linearly with time, with 100% weight at T+14 days, decreasing linearly to 0% weight at T+28 days.\n\nAt T+28 days: The 6 candidates who have received the most votes are elected and immediately join the Council, replacing the Cohort that was up for re-election.\n\nWe need to make three changes to the Arbitrum Constitution:\n\nNew timeline. A dedicated compliance process must be included between the nominee selection and member election phases. This will shift the timeline of events and the total election will now last at least 42 days alongside additional time to install the newly elected Security Council members via the on-chain governance smart contracts.\nLess than 6 eligible nominees. The Arbitrum Foundation has the authority to add new nominees during the Compliance stage if there are less than 6 eligible nominees.\nInstallation time. We need to remove the phrase ‘immediately join the Council’ to take into account the on-chain governance process for installing the newly elected candidates. For example, the various time locks to protect a user’s right to exit Arbitrum during the upgrade and the time it takes to send an L2 → L1 message.\nWith the above in mind, we propose an update to Section 4 of the Constitution with the following text:\n\nNominee selection (T until T+7 days): Any DAO member may declare their candidacy for the Security Council; provided that a current Security Council member in one cohort may not be a candidate for a seat in the other cohort. To the extent that there are more than six candidates, each eligible candidate must be supported by pledged votes representing at least 0.2% of all Votable Tokens.\n\nCompliance process (T+7 until T+21 days): All candidates will cooperate with The Arbitrum Foundation and complete the compliance process. The Arbitrum Foundation is responsible for removing any candidates that fail the compliance process. In the event that fewer than six candidates are supported by pledged votes representing at least 0.2% of all Votable Tokens, the current Security Council members whose seats are up for election may become candidates (as randomly selected out of their Cohort) until there are 6 candidates.\n\nMember election (T+21 until T+42 days): Each DAO member or delegate may vote for any declared candidate. Each token may be cast for one candidate. Votes cast before T+28 days will have 100% weight. Votes cast between T+28 days and T+42 days will have weight based on the time of casting, decreasing linearly with time, with 100% weight at T+28 days, decreasing linearly to 0% weight at T+42 days.\n\nAt T+42 days: The process for replacing the cohort of Security Council members with the 6 candidates who received the most votes will be activated. The installation process must be executed via the on-chain governance smart contracts and it may take several days until the new Security Council members are installed.\n\n\nWe propose to update the Constitution with the following text:\n\nThe Arbitrum Foundation is allocated 14 days for the Compliance process and it should be executed between the Nominee selection and Member election. The Arbitrum Foundation has flexibility to update its compliance policy for every new election. This is required to allow The Arbitrum Foundation to comply with Cayman Island laws. Furthermore, The Arbitrum Foundation maintains the right to issue new procedures and guidelines for off-chain components of the Security Council election. All efforts should be made by The Arbitrum Foundation to ensure an orderly, fair, and transparent election.\nFinal update to the Constitution text.\nFor completeness, the amended text for Section 4 of the Arbitrum Constitution, including the changes from AIP-4:\n\nThe Security Council has 12 members, who are divided into two Cohorts of 6 members.\n\nThe initial Security Council Cohorts were determined by randomly splitting the 12 members into two 6-member cohorts - 6 members in the ‘First Cohort’ and 6 members in the ‘Second Cohort’. The members of the initial Security Council Cohorts are detailed in a transparency report  linked in the discussion",

        "author": "0xA5dF0cf3F95C6cd97d998b9D990a86864095d9b0",
        "body": "Abstract\ntl;dr: AIP-1.1 proposes (1) a lockup, (2) a budget and (3) transparency reporting regarding the 7.5% of the $ARB tokens distributed to the Foundation’s “Administrative Budget Wallet”.\n\nThe Administrative Budget Wallet will be used for covering ongoing administrative and operational costs of The Arbitrum Foundation, payment of service providers, and for the purpose of fostering the growth and development of the Arbitrum ecosystem. In respect to the 7.5% that has been distributed to the Administrative Budget Wallet, a transparency report regarding the 0.5% that has already been transferred is available here 163.\n\nThe remaining 7% of tokens will not be used until the approval of a budget, such as the one proposed in this AIP. The proposed budget is in-line with the Foundation’s strategic needs to represent and service the DAO and the allocation is smaller than initial allocations to peer foundations. This AIP proposes placing the 7% outstanding distribution in a smart contract-controlled lockup – linearly unlocking over 4 years – alongside transparency report structures to allow the DAO to periodically monitor expenditures and other activities of the Foundation.\n\nThe Administrative Budget Wallet will be used in pursuit of the Foundation’s mission statement as set out in the bylaws 24, which includes financing technical improvements and operations of the Arbitrum network, fostering ecosystem growth through grants to align with partner projects and educational initiatives with in-person and online events.\n\nMotivation\nOn March 16, 2023, the Arbitrum networks (Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova) were decentralized and given to the newly formed Arbitrum DAO. Included in this transition were:\n\n-Control of the upgradeability and technical future of the chains\n-Control over the DAO treasury\n-Control over net fee revenue - i.e. the net difference between fees collected by on-chain operations and L1 fees paid by the Sequencer\n-All Arbitrum social media platforms and accounts\n-Ability to elect and, if deemed appropriate, remove the Security Council and Directors\n\nFull responsibility of the chain’s technology, future, and fee revenue were given to the DAO directly. With the DAO assuming those rights and controls, the DAO also assumed the responsibility to fund the ongoing operations of the chains and the costs of running critical chain infrastructure, including RPCs, the Sequencer, and third-party vendors and service contracts.\n\nWhile there are many activities that the DAO can do directly on-chain, several of its responsibilities require a representative that can engage, maintain and enter new agreements with service providers to run infrastructure that’s critical for the ecosystem (e.g. servers, RPCs, block explorers, data feeds and analytics platforms, and tooling), and ensure that both the chain and the ecosystem have the support they need to continue to thrive. In order to ensure a smooth transition to the DAO without any interruption of services, it was necessary to create an organization that would be ready to service the DAO immediately from launch.\n\nThe Arbitrum Foundation was created to fill this need, with its mission and scope outlined across the Foundation Bylaws 24. Prior to the launching of the DAO, The Arbitrum Foundation assumed responsibilities for funding and running chain infrastructure. However, in an arrangement that appears to be unique amongst Arbitrum’s peers, the Foundation does not receive or control the net revenue from transaction fees as this is given directly to the DAO treasury.\n\nThe DAO is also tasked with fostering and developing the Arbitrum ecosystem, where the DAO may seek to partner with companies or organizations that either cannot or will not publicly negotiate collaborations or partnerships due to confidentiality and other operational requirements. Often, large enterprises negotiate partnership opportunities in private without public processes, where these relationships can only be disclosed after they are agreed upon. Having a well-funded Foundation empowered to represent the DAO in this arena, alongside peer foundations, is in the best interests of the DAO to further develop the growth of the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\nRationale\nWhile the need for the Foundation to exist and represent the DAO is well-motivated, it became clear through community discourse around AIP-1 that it was important to have additional insight and restrictions on the Foundation’s initial funding. This AIP-1.1 proposes a detailed set of controls and initiatives to achieve that goal.\n\n1. Smart Contract Lockup:\n\nThe remaining 7% of ARB tokens in the “Administrative Budget Wallet” will be subject to a four year lockup schedule, unlocking on a continuous linear time basis commencing from the date of the Snapshot approval of AIP-1.1 by the DAO (i.e., a total of 175m $ARB released over each year for 4 years). The lockup will be enforced on-chain through a smart contract which will designate a multisig wallet controlled by The Arbitrum Foundation as the beneficiary. The lockup contract will be configured in a manner that allows the DAO to adjust future funding and/or modify the unlock schedule.\n\n2. Operating Budget:\n\nBelow is a proposed annual operational budget for the first year of the Foundation. While the operational costs are denominated in USD, the expectation is that approximately half will be paid in USD and half will be paid in locked $ARB tokens.\n\nAs this will be the first year of the Foundation’s operation and as the Foundation is still young at the time of this AIP, it goes without saying that these are estimates with the expectation that this will be an upper bound on the operational costs for the first 12 months. The transparency reports described in the next section will be an opportunity to track the actual expenses against the budgeted categories and keep the community informed.\n\nOperating Budget: Cost ($USD)\nGeneral and Administrative:\t$16,000,000\nR&D:\t$9,000,000\nTechnical Infrastructure:\t$5,000,000\nEvents, Marketing & Communications:\t$6,000,000\nTotal - Next Twelve Months:\t$36,000,000\n(50% $USD/50% $ARB)\n\n*The General and Administrative line-item includes personnel, contractors, legal, insurance and other operational costs. As of the date of this AIP, the Foundation currently has five full-time contributors, 8 contractors, and the Security Council engaged to support the Arbitrum ecosystem. The Foundation’s budget anticipates the need to hire an additional 15 full-time contributors across technical, growth and community functions over the course of this year.\n\nThis operating budget presents best-faith estimates of the Foundation’s anticipated budgetary needs which may be subject to change.\n\n3. Ecosystem Growth Initiatives\n\nAny additional funds released in compliance with the lock-up schedule above will be made available, but not necessarily deployed, to opportunistically pursue ecosystem growth opportunities and strategic partnerships on behalf of the DAO. The expectation is that the vast majority of ecosystem growth funds will be paid in tokens, and thus will not require the Foundation to sell any tokens. Wherever reasonable, the Foundation will include additional lockups and/or vesting when making distributions in tokens.\n\nThe Mission Statement in the Foundation’s bylaws 24 highlights the varied nature of the opportunities the Foundation intends to pursue, and a set of KPIs that can track all of these opportunities being developed. The basis of those KPIs will stem from a focus on onboarding and growing both the developer and user base of the Arbitrum ecosystem, attracting best-in-class infrastructure providers to the network, expanding across various industries, use-cases and scope of projects that engage with Arbitrum technology. The ultimate goal of the Foundation is to continue to foster the development of the technology and expand the Arbitrum ecosystem globally.\n\nIn addition to the Foundation’s processes for selecting grants, it is important to note that the DAO maintains control over the 3.527 billion $ARB and has the ability to distribute any additional grants as it sees fit. Additionally, should the DAO choose, it has the ability to trigger the inflation of the total supply of $ARB which will supplement the on-chain DAO treasury with 2% growth of the total supply of $ARB each year.\n\n4. Transparency Reports\n\nThe Foundation understands and agrees that the community should have oversight across how these funds are being utilized to gain comfort that spending is in the interest of the community. In furtherance of this goal, the Foundation is committed to providing a comprehensive annual report and a semi-annual progress update. This will provide the community with a better understanding of the Foundation’s expenditures, balance sheet and its pursuit of ecosystem growth opportunities alongside partnership developments, as well as the various internal and external committees and stakeholders that are involved in the decision making process.\n\nThe Foundation is continuing to build out its internal personnel to service grant requests and has already engaged a DAO service provider to assist with the administrative components of servicing grants. The Foundation is also talking with a number of different external service providers to assist in both the review and diligence processes.\n\nThe financial element of these transparency reports will include a breakdown of operational costs incurred while running the Foundation, including infrastructure spending for the Arbitrum chains, events, community building efforts, grants, etc.\n\nIn addition to the aforementioned reports, the Foundation is providing an initial transparency report alongside this AIP covering all major actions and decisions the Foundation made during set-up, including the costs incurred up until now, which can be found here 163.\n\nSteps to Implement\n\n1. Foundation to deploy smart contract vesting wallet in the specified configuration and transfer 700 million $ARB to it.\n2. Foundation to implement all processes described in this AIP.\nTimeline\n\nThis AIP-1.1 shall be posted on the DAO forum and will have at least a 72-hour period for DAO comments and input. After the end of the 72-hour period and appropriate updates incorporating DAO feedback, this AIP-1.1 will be posted for vote on Snapshot for an additional 7 days.\n\n",

    "summary": "The proposal to allow deployments of new Orbit chains on any blockchain is recommended for adoption. This expands the Arbitrum Expansion Program beyond Ethereum L1, potentially increasing DAO revenue and ecosystem growth. Despite concerns about Ethereum alignment, many community members and experts support this pragmatic approach to capture market share and foster development. Historical similar proposals also favored expansion, though with mixed market impacts, providing lessons for cautious execution.",

    "ai_final_reason": "- Timeline analytics show near unanimous early and sustained support for the 'FOR' option, indicating strong and stable voter preference.\n- Forum sentiment is mixed but leans positive toward expansion; key community voices emphasize pragmatic growth and revenue potential, though some caution Ethereum alignment should be preserved.\n- Similar past proposals favored expansion but market impacts showed some price and TVL declines, suggesting need for careful resource management and focus.\n- Market metrics reflect short-term negative price and TVL impacts, but these do not contradict the long-term strategic benefit of expansion.\n- The recommendation aligns with majority sentiment in forum and voting timeline, supporting DAO revenue growth and ecosystem expansion while acknowledging concerns to be managed.\n- This decision weighs durable organizational benefit and pragmatic ecosystem growth above short-term dissent and risk.",
