        "body": "### PR with Payload\nhttps://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/516\n\n## Background\n\nSolarcurve has decided to take a break from the Maxis to delve into the world of DeFi and rediscover his Chad spirit. As part of Solars transition, the team has dedicated substantial time to introspect on our mission, compensation structure, and previous feedback regarding compensation proposals for both the Maxis and other Service Providers (SPs). This funding proposal, unlike its recent predecessors, aims to establish a clear and unified definition of our scope, mandate, and the proposed budget to fund the Maxis until the end of 2023.\n\n## Revised Scope and Mandate:\n\nBased on our recent reflections surrounding the work we have been and are currently doing, and how it creates value and/or is important for the ecosystem, we wrote this Maxi Mandate and Scope:\n\nhttps://forum.balancer.fi/t/balancer-maxis-updated-scope-and-mandate-q4-2023/5190\n\n## Process of determining Compensation Budget\n\nFollowing the completion of the revised Mandate and Scope above, we each individually assessed our time commitments to the Maxis and engaged in candid discussions about compensation rates. Additionally, Gleb, Cosme, and Dubstar, responsible for support and community safety, were included in the compensation discussions alongside the rest of the Maxis team.  Shakotn is increasing his workload in the Maxis as we move to automate the last bits that Solar was doing by hand. \n\nFrom that we concluded, that across all proposed contributors, we will be requiring a liquid USDC pay of **$255,800 USDC** in total for the quarter, for **7.75 FTE** (full-time equivalent) of committed work (we all do more), including 0.75 FTE of budget for additional operations/engineering resources where more. redundancy is required.  The areas of operation for our contributor roster span disciplines including: \n\n- Strategy & Business Development\n- Governance and Protocol Operations\n- DevOps and Automation Engineering\n- Economics\n- Eco-system coordination\n- Community Management\n\nFrom this point, we discounted each contributors pay by 20%, to a total of **************$189,150.00 USDC************** and then offered all Maxi contributors the opportunity to swap liquid USDC pay for 1 year locked auto-compounding auraBAL at a rate of **1.6X**.\n\n41.6% of the USDC took advantage of this program.  BAL was priced on 17-09-2023  at 3.25 USD, resulting in the following requested People budget for the Maxis:\n\n|Quarter|USD in BAL|$BAL|USDC|Total Comp|% in vested BAL|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Q4 (next)|$103,008.00|31,694.77|$148,770.00|$251,778.00|40.91%|\n|Q3 (last)|$114,510.00|25,400.00|$132,630.00|$247,140.00|46.33%|\n||USD in BAL|$BAL|USDC|Total Comp|% change|\n|Change|-$11,502.00|6,294.77|$16,140.00|$4,638.00|1.88%|\n\n\nFurther an additional **20 ETH** is requested to cover gas costs in Q4.  Gas spending last quarter was mostly used dealing with migrations.  Maxi Gas spend can be reviewed here:  \n\nhttps://dune.com/scoffie/advancedmaxigasstation?undefined=\n\n## Vesting auraBAL\n\nLocking veBAL for a year involves:\n\n- Serious tax complications\n- A year of diminishing returns fee flows and bribs.\n- The requirement to keep a high number of wallets holding veBAL with different end dates.\n\nThe Maxis are working to instead develop a locking contract with the following features:\n\n- Accepts auraBAL on Arbitrum and stakes it in the pounder there.\n- Allows the beneficiary to claim any earned $AURA and unvested auraBAL.\n- Accepts multiple deposits with different dates and lock durations.\n- Allows sweeping of the contract with the approval of both the DAO multisig and the beneficiary in case something changes.\n\nOn or around the date that Q4 funds are received the Maxis will use the full BAL allocation for the quarter to deposit directly into auraBAL.  Once the vesting contracts are finished and reviewed, auraBAL will be transferred into the contracts with a lock duration such that they will unlock on October 1st 2024.\n\nBased on feedback to this BIP, we additionally request 20,000 USDC as an available budget to focus on building a community business development and sales facility.  The Maxis role in BD is more focused on operations and advisory as subject matter experts.  We're happy to take on the challenge of finding community members who have the right skillset and passion to bring in new partners.

        "body": "### PR with Payload\nhttps://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/307\n\n### Introduction\n\nThere are some significant changes compared to the last funding proposal and I welcome community feedback as always.\n\nNow that the treasury has a healthier supply of stablecoins and the DAO’s ongoing stablecoin costs look to be significantly lower in Year 2 I think it’s prudent to start paying the liquid portion of salaries in USDC. Thus the breakdown below will look a bit different from last quarter.\n\nWe’ll also be discontinuing Coordinape and adopting a bounty board for community contributors (this is based on feedback from the community and contributors themselves). We will share our learnings from our Coordinape experience soon. Previously 5000 BAL per month or $33,750 was allocated towards this, using last quarter’s BAL price of $6.75.\n\n10,000 USDC per month will be allocated toward the community bounty board. This is expected to compensate regular contributors with clear roles like Cosme, Gleb, and Dubstard for their ongoing work while allowing the opportunity for others to also pick up tasks. The Maxis will own the setup and management of this board and also provide a report on the spend in the monthly forum update.\n\nPreviously we requested 8550 BAL per month for salaries or $57,712. For Q3 we request 31,210 in USDC and 8475 in BAL per month or $68,500. The increase is driven by two factors:\n\n* Tritium’s salary is increasing a little over $5k vs last quarter - this better reflects a market salary for his skill set and his growing importance to the various operations of Maxis.\n* To partially make up for the loss of Coordinape each Maxi was given an additional 200 BAL or 1000 USDC (aside from Tritium)\n\nThis does mean each Maxi aside from Tritium is taking an effective pay cut as average Coordinape rewards per person exceeded the above figures. I believe this is prudent given the challenging market conditions where we must be trimming costs as much as we can.\n\n \n![bip-347-1.png](ipfs://bafkreick4g54svav42kw6jnj2ukvpuoc7f6idqjpv77x2fgnzshaqtlh7a)\n    \n\nLast quarter we asked for 1500 BAL for dev bounties. 875 BAL of that was spent, the details of which you can find in the below table. From this the Maxis have decided to pursue a retainer for Shakotan in the amount of 3000 USDC per month and 600 BAL to be max locked for the quarter. He will continue assisting us in our various Github repos to ensure our automated processes work as reliably and accurately as possible.\n\n \n![bip-347-2.png](ipfs://bafkreibj64iwi2uulfx4ml5pbttawvsjxezeficbd5fnjriwttcymik5v4)\n    \n\nFinally, we’ll ask for an additional 20 ETH from the treasury for gas expenses. You can check out [this dashboard](https://dune.com/scoffie/maxigasstation?undefined=) we commissioned to track gas spending. This may require supplemental funding during the quarter depending on ETH gas prices and if gas intensive activities increase, such as poking additional layer zero cross chain rate providers.\n\n----------------------------------------\n**Service Provider Name:** Balancer Maxis\n\n**Leader(s):** Solarcurve, joined by the returning cast of Mike B, Zekraken, Xeonus, Zen Dragon, Danko, and Tritium.\n\n**Pledge to abide by the DAO's [Code of Conduct](https://www.notion.so/balancergrants/Code-of-Conduct-fef15e2ed1f5453f8bd56f338c70bb88) (or link to your own):** Yes\n\n**Pledge to abide by the [Accountability Guidelines](https://www.notion.so/balancergrants/Accountability-Guidelines-229d93372403415688f8d3dc4cb964b1):** Yes\n\n**Domains of Operation + Key Objectives & Success Metrics:**\n\nAs Balancer pursues its path for further decentralization, the Balancer Maxis workgroup presents community contributors aligned with the protocol's future and long-term sustainability. Whether proposing and executing innovative ideas, or protecting the interests of the ecosystem and helping third-party projects, Maxis have proven to be a key component of Balancer.\n\nOur Q3 proposal is effectively asking veBAL Governance the continuation of this decentralized collaboration group, and reading on previous [Q2 funding post](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-230-fund-the-balancer-maxis-for-q2-2023/4562) might bring some additional context to the present proposal.The following will be kept brief and at a high level. More granular metrics can be found in our monthly updates for April, May, and June.\n\n*Multisig Management*\n\n* Linear (boosted) pool settings\n* Swap fee and amplification adjustments\n* Adding newly approved gauges to veBAL\n* Adding new reward tokens to gauges\n* Withdrawing and distributing protocol fees\n* Verifying and queuing all transactions before execution by the DAO Multisig\n* Together with Balancer Labs we operate the Emergency subDAO Multisig\n\nThese are some of the basic functions required to ensure smooth operation of the Balancer Protocol for all its end users. We believe the best metric for success is that most users are not even aware that these tasks exist – they simply observe a new gauge being approved by voters then appearing on the voting list or find protocol fees in the claim section every week, etc. Maxis ensure that the various multisigs and their relevant functions are used properly and promptly, and all transactions are verified for accuracy by at least two people.\n\n*Governance*\n\n* We act as verifiers of last resort for BIPs that require on-chain execution and we post BIPs ready for a vote on snapshot - though anyone with 200k veBAL can also post to snapshot.\n* Active participants in Discord and the Forum on governance topics\n* Several of us are [delegates](https://forum.balancer.fi/c/delegate-citadel/14)\n* Advise projects on Balancer’s governance process\n* Manage admin of the Governance Forum\n* We will pursue various strategic initiatives (such as BIP-19) at our discretion, either individually or as a group.\n\n*Automation and Tooling*\n\n* We work with Mimic to sweep and process our collected fees into USDC.\n* We run scripts that collect data and redirect fees to vote markets for veBAL holders to collect with their votes.\n* We build, deploy and fund [[Chainlink Automation Upkeeps](https://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/tree/main/chainlink_keepers)](https://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/tree/main/chainlink_keepers) which handle regular operations for veBAL, and incentive management for our strategic partners.\n* We continue to develop more reporting to help validate and verify submitted multisig payloads.\n* We track and organize governance operations through the transparent and open [Balancer Multisig Operations repository](https://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops).\n* We build and maintain internal tooling complex and common tasks such as pool creation and linear pool management.These tools are not polished/require some knowledge to operate, but we share them with some support in our bizdev and community support conversations.\n* Members of the Maxis, often supported by external grants, build and maintain analytics for the Balancer ecosystem.\n\nMaxis spend a good deal of time developing and conducting operational processes to keep fees flowing and governance systems operational and accurate. In 2023 we have started flexing our coding skills more and working to automate governance and partner liquidity management support operations in ways that are more “no-stop” and permissionless when possible.\n\n*Partnerships*\n\n* We manage Balancer’s Discord and ensure questions or concerns are addressed\n* Help projects use Balancer by offering advice or answering questions\n* We often deploy new pools for other projects\n* Whitelisting and maintaining token lists\n* We help with UI testing for Balancer\n* Seek out new opportunities to apply Balancer’s technology, primarily in the DeFi realm\n* Manage relationships with partners across the entire lifecycle from initial conversations to implementation to final results\n* Coordinate partner needs with other teams in the Balancer ecosystem, e.g. integrations.\n\nMaxis took the lead on partnerships in the Balancer ecosystem during Q4 2022 after the biz dev team at Orb was dissolved. The primary near term goals are expanding boosted pool offerings focused primarily on Aave v3, encouraging adoption of ve80/20 or similar systems, making Balancer the hub of LST liquidity, and increasing utilization of the veBAL flywheel (projects bribing, parking POL, etc). Generally we believe Balancer has made solid progress over the last few months on these initiatives.\n\n*Community*\n\n* We manage a bounty board, open to community contribution\n* Onboarding framework for new contributors\n* Discord moderation and security\n* First responders to user support\n* Bridging the community inquires to other Service Providers\n\nThis quarter’s proposal represents a big shift from the framework inherited from the Ops subDAO and the Coordinape reward system. Having an open community for new contributors wanting to join the Balancer ecosystem is a great concern for us. However, we have learned that bounties can attract higher quality and project-oriented contributors that might be more likely to be retained. Soon we will share more about our experience using Coordinape.\n\nThis new approach will allow the community’s marketing efforts currently under the Maxis to be handed out to Beethoven’s team plans for [community developments](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-314-funding-proposal-for-beethoven-x-dao-marketing/4810).\n\nThe legacy onboarding program will still be running, reaching every applicant through discovery calls to help contributors understand the DAO operating framework (BIP-1) and set in motion their ideas for Balancer.\n\n*Project Management*\n\n* Lead weekly meetings with team leads across the ecosystem to align on projects in flight\n* Be the driving force behind the ecosystem’s top roadmap priorities and be accountable for their delivery\n* Track project dependencies across the teams and coordinate among relevant parties\n\nMaxis assumed the role of project management for the ecosystem in Q1. We are well positioned for this as we are the point of contact for outside teams & projects and we have established working relationships with all internal teams. Our experience in executing various initiatives in the last 9 months means we have a lot of insight into what it takes to take a project from start to finish.\n\n*Record Keeping*\n\n* We will maintain a notion page detailing the activity of each of our controlled multisigs. Included will be documentation on how to use the powers of the multisig so a future SP can easily take it over in case we are off boarded.\n\n**Length of Engagement & Budget:**\n\n3 months.\n\nBudget of 34,210 USDC per month for salaries and 8,475 BAL per month, plus Shakotan’s 600 BAL for the quarter. We also request an additional monthly allocation of 10,000 USDC per month for the bounty board and a quarterly allocation of 20 ETH for gas expenses.\n\n**Total for 3 month engagement: 132,630 USDC and 26,025 BAL and 20 ETH** (ETH is excluded in the following comparison).\n\n*Comparison against last quarter:* Using today’s BAL price of $4.4 we’re requesting $247,140 this quarter. Last quarter we requested 42,150 BAL at a price of $6.75 or $284,512. Thus this quarter’s funding proposal represents a reduction in costs of $37,372.\n\n**Funds to transfer:** 132,630 USDC and 25,400 BAL and 20 ETH (to reflect the unspent 625 BAL from last quarter’s dev bounties)\n\n*Impact on the Treasury*: The Treasury currently holds ~4.5M BAL. Funding the Balancer Maxis for Q3 would cost around 0.5% of the treasury’s BAL holdings, which annualizes to ~1.5% of the treasury’s BAL. The Treasury currently holds ~4.5M in USDC. Funding the USDC portion would cost around 3% of the treasury’s USDC, which annualizes to ~12%.\n\n**ETH Address to Receive Funds:** 0x166f54F44F271407f24AA1BE415a730035637325\n\n**Link to SLA (if going through the Foundation:** N/A",

        "body": "## Motivation\nWe’re now a few months into the V2 Liquidity Mining Program, and everyone’s been learning what’s good about it, as well as where improvements could be made to make the most of every BAL token we allocate. Since the launch, we’ve added a new Tier 4 (following a governance vote), and introduced liquidity mining rewards on Polygon. We’re quickly gaining traction on Polygon, and created a lot of excitement around Balancer, which has been awesome.\n\nOver the coming weeks, there’s plans for launching on Arbitrum (although we need to be mindful of spreading liquidity mining rewards too thin + liquidity fragmentation), new pool deployments, and a number of dual incentive partnerships.\n\nWhile all very positive and exciting, these plans create additional pressure on the limited number of liquidity mining slots we have, and it’s becoming difficult to envisage how everything will fit in without further changes to the tiers and slots. We also have some potential partnerships with smaller projects where weekly BAL rewards as low as 100-500 BAL per pool may make sense, which the committee doesn’t currently have the power to grant (the smallest we currently have available to us is a Tier 4 slot, at 1,000 BAL per week).\n\nDual incentive partnerships with smaller projects are very helpful for long term relationship building, securing liquidity for good projects which will grow over time & marketing to new users.\n\n## Specification\nIf this proposal is approved, the Liquidity Mining Committee would be able to allocate a total of 10,000 BAL per week however it wants, outside of the tier system, to whichever networks & pools it decides make sense at the time, based on available opportunities.\n\nThis 10,000 BAL per week will be made available by removing 2xTier 2 slots, currently filled by USDC/WETH & USDT/WETH on Ethereum. There were already plans to deprecate these pools over time, as the Tier 1 WETH/DAI pool is planned to be replaced by a WETH/staBAL-3 pool when the batch relayer is ready.\n\nThis flexible BAL allocation will make it much easier for the committee to fine tune liquidity mining rewards, and phase pools in/out of rewards. For Polygon, Arbitrum, or any other network Balancer’s governance may decide to incentivise in the future, the committee will not be able to allocate more than the total BAL voted on by governance to that network across the new flexible BAL allocation and tiers. If flexible BAL is to be allocated to a network that would take it over its limit, a Tiered slot would need to be allocated back to Ethereum to keep it under.\n\nAs of the time of this proposal, a maximum of 25,000 BAL per week can be allocated to Polygon, and 25,000 BAL per week to Arbitrum. Governance may vote to change these limits in the future.\n\n## Dependencies\nNone. The frontend liquidity mining script has already been updated to be more flexible, such that we could allocate any amount of BAL to any pool.\n\n## Risk Assessment\nWe see no greater risk that Committee Members could “go rogue” and mis-manage rewards than they could with the current structure.\n\nGovernance would continue to have the power to halt the powers of the committee at any time, or remove members from the committee if it deemed such an action appropriate. The need for committee votes to pass changes each week would provide several days for governance to intervene, were such an intervention deemed necessary.",

        "body": "## TL;DR:\n\n* Automation for core pool incentives. See code  [here](https://github.com/BalancerMaxis/protocol_fee_allocator/blob/main/fee_allocator/notebooks/pool_fees_and_accounting.ipynb) and results from last round [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16axBQBVNdPssQyjcIyb_4m4vOb5rKISIlrVMk7A2qjs/edit#gid=53204006).\n* Reduction of threshold to receive voting incentives for an epoch from $5000 in accumulated fees to <$1000.\n* Equal handling of incentive disbursements for Mainnet and L2s\n  * Core Pool incentives always flow to the pools that generated the fee, no handling by TVL.\n * Mainnet pays 50% of protocol fees to core pools independent of the pool fee  source which results in a 20% increased fee flow to core pool voters\n\n## Motivation\n\n[The Core Pools program](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-19-incentivize-core-pools-l2-usage/3329) was first initiated in July 2022. The original proposal underwent many iterations, making it less and less reproducible. As more chains have been added, the current system has too many moving parts and manual touch-points to maintain well. This BIP seeks to consolidate learnings and the current state of the incentive program, while simultaneously introducing a new automated system for handling fee redirection.\n\n## History and Context\n\nThe Core Pools program fundamentally specifies that certain pools would have the portion of protocol fees due to veBAL holders being redirected as vote incentives. By incentivizing voters for voting on such pools through the fees generated, the proposal aligned short-term incentives with the sustainability of the protocol, creating a flywheel fueled by incentives for veBAL holders to direct BAL emissions to the most lucrative pools on Balancer.\n\nThe designation of Core Pools has generally been defined in various governance matters and through ongoing operations as pools that have at least 50% of their allocations containing yield assets with rate providers and paying protocol fees. Additionally, a number of pools have been explicitly added to the list by governance.\n\nThe degree to which fees have been directed has varied but as of [BIP-371](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-371-adjust-protocol-fee-split/4978) they stand such that L1 Core Pools & L2’s pay 50% of their collected protocol fees to support Core Pools on the chain they originate from. In the case of L1’s this has always been paid to the pool that generated the fees. In the case of L2’s various strategies were used, but often much of the available voting incentives have been allocated based on the relative TVL of the pools in each chain.\n\nAs the calculation of core pool voting incentives has so far been a manual process completed on a [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xwUPpbYq7woVOU9vQ8EB8MY75I-1mauTLyDVwvKUDKo/edit#gid=0), the addition of “whitelisting” pools has been done by the Balancer Maxi’s prompted by a mixture of biz dev conversation and discovering new pools that were generating large enough fee-flows to work within the program.\n\nRelated to this manual calculation, the Core Pools program has so far not worked well for smaller pools. Currently, fees are only swept from pools if they amount to more than $5,000 USD. As a result, pools that generate under 5k USD per 2 week fee collection epoch often would have to wait a number of weeks or even months before enough fees accumulated to place a single voting incentive lasting 2 weeks.\n\nWork has been ongoing to automate the calculation of these flows, and the system is in good shape to start being used. This BIP introduces and specifies the new automated system for allocating core pool voting incentives, and describes:\n\n* The logic it follows\n* The relevant configurations involved and where they can be found/how changes to them are controlled.\n\n## Core Pools 2.0\n\nMost of the changes below pertain to automation. Additionally:\n\n* L2s are moving from distributing fees based on relative TVL to based on relative fee generation.\n* As with L2s, 50% of all fees generated on Mainnet will be paid into the core pools voting incentive.\n  * This simplifies/unifies the core pool process\n  * Measured over the last few rounds, this results in around 5% to 20% of the current USDC flowing directly to veBAL being redirected to vote incentives on Mainnet Core Pools).\n* Better attribution and more frequent sweeping/swapping of fees results in a more accurate fee distribution.\n\n### Fee Epoch Process:\n\n* Fees are swept and sold for USDC and BAL on a regular basis by [Mimic](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-115-balancer-smart-vaults-fee-collector/3966).\n* Every other Friday, aligning with Aura voting epochs, all available USDC is bridged to the Fee Handling multisig on Mainnet.\n* The [automation script](https://github.com/BalancerMaxis/protocol_fee_allocator/blob/main/fee_allocator/notebooks/pool_fees_and_accounting.ipynb) will run and generate csv outputs and a multisig payload in this [directory](https://github.com/BalancerMaxis/protocol_fee_allocator/tree/main/fee_allocator/allocations)\n* The payload will be loaded into the fee sweeper multisig, reviewed by the Maxis and then signed/executed.\n\n### Fee Automation:\n\n100% of all $BAL fees earned are sent to veBAL as direct incentives. The below handling pertains to remaining USDC:\n\n#### Allocation of collected protocol fees:\n\n*vote_incentive_pct* percent of the total protocol fees collected on each pool will be allocated to voting incentives daoPct percent of the total protocol fees will be sent to the DAO.\n\n*vebal_share_pct* percent of the total protocol fees will be flowed to veBAL over 2 weeks along with the BAL specified above.\n\n#### Allocation of Voting Incentives:\n\nAllocation of voting incentives occurs per chain. The following logic is applied on each chain, pertaining to the total available fees collected for voting incentives on the same chain:\n\nEach pool on the chains [Core Pools List](https://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/blob/main/config/core_pools.json) will be assessed for the USD value of total fees collected over the 2 weeks preceding the fee collection epoch. Pools will be allocated a portion of the available voting incentives based on their relative fee generation.\n\nAny pool that has less than min_vote_incentive_amount in voting incentives will be excluded from the round, and its voting incentives will be distributed to the remaining core pools.\n\nThe Voting Incentive amount will be split between veBAL and vlAURA voting markets based on the auraBAL’s total capture of veBAL. If there is less than min_aura_incentive available to allocate voting incentives to AURA, all voting incentives will be shifted to either BAL or Aura in a way that tries to maintain auraBAL capture split across the entire set.\n\nVoting incentives will be placed on one or more voting incentive markets such that the allocated fees flow to the proper set of holders, and are all paid out for votes that generate emissions over the following 2 weeks. Currently Hiddenhand is integrated, but we are happy to explore additional integrations such as Paladin, VoteMarket or other emerging voting markets.\n\n#### Final Payload\n\nAll of the transactions to place incentives and pay fees to the DAO and veBAL are packaged up into a multisig payload to be used in the process above.\n\n## Specification/Configuration:\n\nThe processes above will be used for generating and adding payloads going forward. The following [initial parameters](https://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/blob/main/config/protocol_fees_constants.json) will be set:\n\n|Parameter|Value|\n| --- | --- |\n|vote_incentive_pct|%50|\n|dao_share_pct|%17.5|\n|vebal_share_pct|%32.5|\n|min_vote_incentive_amount|$500|\n|min_aura_incentive|$500|\n\nThe [Core Pools List](https://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/blob/main/config/core_pools.json) will be accepted as the current configured list of core pools. Further changes will be made based on payloads approved by governance.\n\nWhile the system has the capacity to [reroute voting incentives](https://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/blob/main/config/core_pools_rerouting.json) from one pool to another in case of a desire to migrate liquidity, none of this rerouting has been configured.\n\n### Future Changes to Configuration\n\nWork will continue on voting incentive automation and all changes will not be brought to governance, however basic intentions of the program and the specific parameters above are considered fixed and not to be changed without a further instruction from governance.\n\nThere are considerations around total gas cost to voting incentive//vote/claim. The min_vote_incentive_amount values seek to keep this somewhat under control.\n\nmin_vote_incentive_amount may be tuned by the Balancer Maxis up to $1000 USD without a vote in response to on-chain gas costs.\n\nmin_aura_incentive shall be maintained such that any Aura Voting Incentive always achieves well over the minimum votes required on Aura to register for a veBAL vote. The Balancer Maxis shall be granted the responsibility and authority for maintaining this value.\n\nAll changes to any of the configurations specified above should be made by a governance vote that includes a payload PR with the specific changes.",

        "body": "This proposal also appears on [Balancer's forum](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/balancer-grants-dao-wave-2/2275).\n\nThis draft has been created by the committee of the Balancer Grants DAO. See its previous proposal for establishing this committee [here](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/proposal-establish-the-balancer-grants-dao-and-coordinate-the-next-wave-of-balancer-community-grants/2095).\n\n## Summary\nThis proposal aims to fund the next cycle (Nov 1st - January 31st) of Balancer Grants DAO. The upcoming program will further accelerate the development of the Balancer ecosystem by improving coordination around Grants, RFPs and Ventures.\n\nThe requested budget for this next cycle (3 months) is 50,000 BAL. Similar to the first Balancer Grants DAO proposal, a learnings and review end report will be created at the end of the cycle, and any unspent resources will be sent back to the BAL treasury.\n\nThe Balancer Grants committee has already worked together during the first 3 month’s cycle. To maintain continuity and support for the grants that are still running, and the applicants that have applied, we want to have the proposal for the next cycle up and ready on time. The first round has been a success and shows the need and the potential for a bigger Balancer Ecosystem. To get a better idea of what has been done, check out our monthly reports on the [Balancer Community Notion](https://balancergrants.notion.site/Grants-Updates-404ae3750a084de78116cb899b17e2b9). An end report for cycle 1 is being finalized and will be published at the end of the current cycle, which is running until the 31st of October.\n\nFrom the beginning we have looked at this first round as a time of learning and iterating, building on what works and leaving behind what is useless. With this in mind, the committee requested a lower amount than is often given to grant programs within the crypto space. Now that the committee and the Balancer community is aware of these learning points, the following rounds will no doubt go even smoother than this round already went.\n\n## Impact\nLooking back on the first cycle, we can say with confidence that the program has been a success. The program has been able to pull in multiple promising and established DeFi projects into the Balancer Ecosystem. To build long term relationships and grow Balancer’s TVL were the main objectives, and the program is clearly delivering. We as a committee have identified multiple opportunities when it comes to ecosystem building and want to act upon these in the next cycle.\n\nEstablishing well-aligned yet autonomous units within the Balancer Ecosystem aligns with Balancer’s Decentralization and Ecosystem strategy. Having multiple entities co-develop the Balancer ecosystem creates value-add opportunities and allows the separate entities to specialize further.\n\n## PROPOSAL\nWe propose some small changes to the current setup of the grants program, and advocate to further the decentralization of the BalancerDAO. We believe this can be done through multiple committees, initially funded by the Balancer Grants DAO. We understand that this is a slow and long process, so this will be a learning experience where we want to plant the seeds for the future.\n\nThe grant program provides support and funding ($5K - USD $75K, paid in BAL) to projects committed to supporting Balancer Protocol in achieving its mission to become the number one source of liquidity for DeFi. This program is made for groups and individuals that aspire to run a project that builds on the Balancer Protocol or supports the development of the Balancer ecosystem.\n\nThe RFP (bounty) program provides rewards for completion of key tasks identified by the Balancer community. It’s the easiest way for anyone to contribute to the Balancer ecosystem. RFPs can be either technical or non-technical and vary in reward size depending on the required skill set and time needed to complete.\n\nThe venture program aims to expand the Balancer ecosystem and further align incentives with ecosystem partners through partnership agreements, token swaps and DAO2DAO ventures. We propose to start this off with a Venture Lead role who will be actively building out these types of deals and structures. With the actual outcomes going to the forum and being voted upon by the community. To support this opportunity, it needs some firepower and a dedicated role plus support can bring that.\n\nThe end-goal of the complete program is to attract and retain talent and resources to the Balancer ecosystem.\n\n## Snapshot Limit\nPlease view the rest of this proposal in Balancer's forum. The link is at the top of this page. The total ask in BAL is 51,000 and a full breakdown is available on the forum.\n",
