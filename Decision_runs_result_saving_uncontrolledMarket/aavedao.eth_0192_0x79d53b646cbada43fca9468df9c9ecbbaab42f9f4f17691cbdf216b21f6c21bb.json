        "body": "## Summary\n\nA proposal to increase OP’s liquidation threshold and LTV on Aave V3 Optimism.\n\n## Motivation\n\nOP is currently configured with a liquidation threshold (LT) of 40% and max loan-to-value (LTV) of 30%. These parameters were intentionally [set](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-add-op-as-collateral-to-aave-v3/9087/18) conservatively and in isolation mode, when the asset was first listed to ensure mechanisms were working as intended. In [October 2023](https://governance-v2.aave.com/governance/proposal/337/), OP was removed from isolation mode. Following our observations, we believe it prudent to increase the LT and LTV for OP.\n\nOP's average market cap over the past 180 days is $1.78BN, and its daily average volume is $192M.\n\nIt has registered a daily annualized volatility of 98.53%, a 30-day annualized volatility of 92.6%, and its largest single-day price drop was 17.7%.\n\n3.7M of the 7.4M OP supplied is supplied by a single [user](https://community.chaoslabs.xyz/aave/risk/wallets/0x790c9422839fd93a3a4e31e531f96cc87f397c00), who also maintains large positions on Arbitrum and Ethereum. Their last deposit on Optimism was 252K OP on March 12; they repaid $1M USDT on April 6 and currently hold a health score of 2.02.\n\nThe majority of assets borrowed against OP collateral are stablecoins. That puts these positions at risk of liquidation in the event OP’s price moves falls.\nHowever, collateral at risk does not exceed $100K until OP’s price falls to $2.13, a 35% drop from current levels.\n\nGiven these observations, we recommend first aligning OP’s parameters with ARB’s on Arbitrum (50% LTV and 60% LT), an asset with a similar supply distribution and liquidity profile. Following observations at these levels and utilizing our simulation platform, these parameters may be further optimized.\n\n## Specification\n\n| Chain | Asset | Current LTV | Recommended LTV | Current LT | Recommended LT |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Optimism | OP | 30.00% | 50.00% | 40.00% | 60.00% |\n\n# Next Steps\n\nWe invite a community discussion around the proposed parameter updates and, barring community objection, will follow up with a Snapshot vote in five days.\n\n# Disclaimer\n\nChaos Labs has not been compensated by any third party for publishing this ARFC.\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain)",

        "body": "## Summary\n\nA proposal to adjust sAVAX’s LT and LTV on Aave V3 Avalanche.\n\n## Motivation\n\nIncreasing the liquidation threshold and LTV for assets allows Aave to enhance users’ capital efficiency. However, this must be balanced with proper risk management to ensure that there is a sufficient buffer in the event of large drawdowns and/or liquidations. The analysis below was conducted utilizing our LT simulations, which showed either minimal or no increases in VaR at the recommended LT levels while also considering user distribution and on-chain liquidity.\n\n### sAVAX\n\nsAVAX’s LTV and LT are currently set to 30% and 40%, respectively (its E-Mode parameters are 92.5% and 95%). The top suppliers are primarily looping sAVAX and WAVAX, reducing the risk of large-scale liquidations in this market. \n\nHowever, there are is a small amount of non-WAVAX borrows against sAVAX, primarily WETH.e and stablecoins.\n\n\nMoreover, sAVAX maintains strong liquidity against AVAX, meaning that potential liquidations of sAVAX collateralized debt are likely to be completed efficiently.\n\n\nGiven user distribution and liquidity, we recommend increasing LTV to 40% and LT to 45%.\n\n## Specification\n\nGiven these observations, we recommend making the following changes:\n\n| Chain | Asset | Parameter | Current | Recommended |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Avalanche | sAVAX | LTV | 30% | 40% |\n| Avalanche | sAVAX | Liquidation Threshold | 40% | 45% |\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. Following community feedback, submit the ARFC for a snapshot vote for final approval.\n2. If consensus is reached, submit an Aave Improvement Proposal (AIP) to implement the proposed updates.\n\n## **Disclaimer**\n\nChaos Labs has not been compensated by any third party for publishing this ARFC.\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain)",

The user’s current health score is 2.86.\n\n### Recommendations\n\nGNO is currently listed with relatively conservative parameters: 36% LT and 31% LTV. We recommend an increase to 50% and 45%, respectively.

        "body": "## Simple Summary\n\nA proposal to increase the debt ceiling of MKR on V3 Ethereum\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe current debt ceiling for MKR on V3 Ethereum, set at $6M, has reached 100% utilization. \n\nGiven current market conditions and improved liquidity for MKR on Ethereum over the past months, our [Isolation Mode Methodology](https://governance.aave.com/t/chaos-labs-isolation-mode-methodology/12440) supports increasing the debt ceiling for MKR to $8.5M. \n\nIt is important to note that the majority of MKR debt positions are concentrated within two accounts, accounting for over 80% of the total debt, as outlined below. While this concentration does not affect the current recommendation, it is something to continue monitoring and will be considered in future MKR recommendations and in cases of significant market changes.\n\n### V2 → V3 Migration\n\nThere are still nearly 3,400 MKR supplied on V2 Ethereum, with nearly $750K in stablecoins borrowed against MKR collateral. The current supply caps and proposed debt ceiling should allow for the migration of these positions.  \n\n### Positions Analysis\n\nThere are currently two major users utilizing MKR as collateral on V3 Ethereum:\n\n1. [0xa9dee54892713f43c221509cfedbd717d16791a0](https://community-staging.chaoslabs.xyz/aave/risk/wallets/0xa9dee54892713f43c221509cfedbd717d16791a0) -  borrowing $3.11M DAI against his 5,914 MKR collateral, accounting for nearly 52% of the debt ceiling. The user's current health score is 1.77.\n2. [0x8af700ba841f30e0a3fcb0ee4c4a9d223e1efa05](https://community-staging.chaoslabs.xyz/aave/risk/wallets/0x8af700ba841f30e0a3fcb0ee4c4a9d223e1efa05) -  borrowing $1.84M USDC against his 4,077 MKR collateral, accounting for nearly 31% of the debt ceiling. The user's current health score is 2.06.\n\n## Specification:\n\n| Asset | Parameter | Current | Recommended |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| MKR | Debt Ceiling | 6,000,000 | 8,500,000 |\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. Following community feedback, submit the ARFC for a snapshot vote for final approval.\n2. If consensus is reached, submit an Aave Improvement Proposal (AIP) to implement the proposed updates.\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nChaos Labs has not been compensated by any third party for publishing this ARFC.\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain)",
