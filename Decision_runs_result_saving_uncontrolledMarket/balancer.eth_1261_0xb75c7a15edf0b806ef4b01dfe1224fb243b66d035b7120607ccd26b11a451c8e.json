If approved, this BIP would see 5,500 BAL paid out to the 11 DAO Multisig signers for their work over the previous six months.\n\nBased on feedback from signers and the team around tax implications, instead of sending BAL to all signers, we asked who wanted it and only included those who responded.  Any of the other signers are free to request BAL payments, which will be paid referencing this BIP\n\n\n### Specification\n\nThe DAO Multisig `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` will send 500 BAL to each of the following addresses:\n\nMounir (Paraswap): 0x0951FF0835302929d6c0162b3d2495A85e38ec3A\n0xMaki: 0x285b7EEa81a5B66B62e7276a24c1e0F83F7409c1\nEvan (Copper): 0x59693BA1A5764e087CE166ac0E0085Fc071B9ea7\nTritium (Balancer Maxis): 0xcf4fF1e03830D692F52EB094c52A5A6A2181Ab3F\nnanexcool: 0x823DF0278e4998cD0D06FB857fBD51e85b18A250\nStefan (Gnosis): 0x9F7dfAb2222A473284205cdDF08a677726d786A0\n\n\nFurther, the DAO Multisig is authorized to send 500 BAL each to the following addresses until the end of February if payments is requested.

        "body": "# Balancer Grants DAO Service Provider Proposal\n\n## Overview\n\nThis proposal is to continue Balancer Grants within the Balancer DAO, as an independent community-owned grants program for the Balancer ecosystem as a Service Provider (SP). The program aims to accelerate the development of the BAL ecosystem while optimizing contributor rewards in the Balancer ecosystem. Grants are an alternative pathway for projects aimed at funding smaller, short term or one off projects up to $100k USD that don’t fit the Foundation Service Provider funding model.\n\nGiven the increase in BAL price since the previous request, there is no additional funding requested from the Balancer DAO treasury for the grants budget for Q4 2022, however this proposal seeks approval for the budget detailed below.\n\nThe current Balancer Grants team has been working together under the previous [snapshot proposal](https://snapshot.org/#/balancer.eth/proposal/0x29c1d0e6b7d09fbee6f69d28b24539e1a793c7a7d61ca7eb039686ae5de6ed02) passed on July 4, 2022. To date, the grants program has successfully delivered 5 waves of funding and mentoring, expanding the Balancer ecosystem by encouraging building to increase TVL. This proposal is to continue the operation of the grants program as per [BIP-22](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-22-fund-balancer-grants-for-q3/3350), changes to this are outlined below.\n\n## Domain of Operation\n\nThe grant program provides support and funding (up to $100K USD, paid in BAL) to projects committed to supporting Balancer Protocol in achieving its mission to become the number one source of liquidity for DeFi. This program is made for groups and individuals that aspire to run a project that builds on the Balancer Protocol or supports the development of the Balancer ecosystem. While the Foundation SP model is aimed at long term engagements or those with a cost beyond $100k USD, grants are an alternative pathway aimed at funding smaller, short term or one off projects.\n\nThe Balancer Grants DAO Service Provider will be operated by the Grants Committee, a group of diverse and experienced Balancer contributors. More details on the Grants Committee can be found further in this proposal.\n\n## Grants Committee\n\nThe Grants Committee consists of dedicated Balancer contributors with strong analytical and support backgrounds.\n\nMitch Burns - Committee Co-Lead\n\nZen Dragon - Committee Co-Lead\n\nJay Napier - Committee Member/Mentor\n\nJohn Grant - Committee Member/Mentor\n\nMike B - Committee Member/Mentor\n\nXeonus - Committee Member/Mentor\n\nZeKraken - Committee Member/Mentor\n\nThe Grants Committee will work closely with Balancer Labs, Orb Collective and Ballers to amplify and support grantees.\n\nBy having a dedicated and diverse group of committee members and proactively working together with other ecosystem partners, Balancer Grants are set out to be one of the most effective grants programs in DeFi.\n\n## Length of Engagement and Budget breakdown\n\nThis budget contains all costs for the full operations of the Balancer Grants DAO for the period October 1st, 2022 until December 31st, 2022. At the end of this cycle (December 31st), any unallocated resources will be sent back to the Balancer Treasury or kept to offset the next epoch budget request. A new proposal for the next cycle will be submitted at the end of this cycle.\n\nOnce remaining USDC in grants treasury is spent on grants committee compensation, future compensation will be paid out in BAL instead of USDC to assist the DAO in becoming sustainable from protocol fees. Due to the inconsistent nature of grants and the associated workload, grants team members will self-assess their level of contribution against defined Tiers each month to determine their compensation which is reviewed by the grants co-leads and committee.\n\nTiers are:\n\nCommittee Lead / Major Contribution - $5,000 USD paid in BAL - significant administration of grants docs, prepare and present monthly reports/community calls, wave round up, grantee announcements, budget preparation and SP proposals, .\n\nHigh Level Contributor - $3,500 USD paid in BAL - as per Low Contributor plus mentor 5+ low assistance grantees or 3+ high assistance grantees.\n\nMedium Level Contributor - $2,500 USD paid in BAL - as per Low Contributor plus mentor 2-3 low assistance grantees or 1-2 high assistance grantees.\n\nLow Level Contributor - $1,250 USD paid in BAL - contribute to weekly grants meeting, follow up call for 1-2 grant applications, mentor at least 1 grantee with low level assistance required (generally self-sufficient grantee with no major coordination with BLabs).\n\n|Name|Amount in BAL/USD|Description|\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|Q4 Grants|95k BAL ($475k USD @ $5.00 USD/BAL)|To be rewarded to grantees based on milestones following the full Grants review process. For sub $5k USD contributions a light review process will be utilized.|\n|2 Grant co-lead|$5k x 2 x 3 months / $5.00 = 6,000 BAL|The Grants Lead role is split between 2 co-leads. Roles takes ownership of the establishment and operations of the Balancer Grant processes. The co-leads are responsible for coordinating with Committee Members, scheduling and hosting meetings, maintaining Medium and Notion pages and leading the post grants report.|\n|5 committee members|$2.5k average x 5 x 3 months / $5.00 = 7,500 BAL|Commit to supporting & reviewing up to 10 hours a week and mentoring up to 5 hours a week each month|\n|Other Program Expenses|600BAL|Any other program expenses that may be required for the smooth execution of the grants program. This may include (but is not limited to) to design, media, PR, research, legal, gas fees or any other specialized functions outside the skillset of the committee|\n|Total Budget request for quarter|109,100 BAL||\n\n## Service Provider Pledge\n\nThe Grant DAO service provider agrees to operate under the existing Balancer DAO’s Code of Conduct, as listed [here](https://www.notion.so/balancergrants/Code-of-Conduct-fef15e2ed1f5453f8bd56f338c70bb88)\n\nThe Grant DAO service also pledges to be held accountable by the Balancer Token Holder in accordance with the Balancer DAO [Accountability Guidelines](https://www.notion.so/balancergrants/Accountability-Guidelines-229d93372403415688f8d3dc4cb964b1). This will include the Grant’s Committee:\n\n* Holding an open community call monthly and keeping a recording available for 3 months\n* Developing a monthly report detailing key objective progress which is posted to the Balancer Forum\n* Attending the internal monthly DAO meeting (mandatory attendance by a least 1 representative)\n\n## Specification\n\nThere is no on-chain action required. If approved, the Grants Committee multi-sig (currently 3 out of 6) will continue to operate with the remaining funds from Wave 5 in the Grants treasury (0xE2c91f3409Ad6d8cE3a2E2eb330790398CB23597) carried over and approved to be delegated to the grantees. All transactions will be recorded in a Sheet and summarized at the end of the Grants Cycle.\n\n## ETH Address to Receive Funds\n\nNot required, sufficient budget due to significant increase in BAL price since July and remaining balance from Wave 5.\n\nCurrent Treasury Balance ~ 148,373 BAL\n\nCommitted BAL ~ 38,366 BAL @ $5.00 USD\n\nUncommitted BAL in treasury ~110,008 BAL.",

        "body": "## Payload\nhttps://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/190\n\n## TL;DR\n- Inverse Finance has around bb-e-usd representing around  $300,000 of the  around $320,000  in liquid value still held in bb-e-usd and rightfully owned by remaining bb-e-usd holders.  The inverse bb-e-usd is  in a contract that will not allow them to withdraw using methods so far provided. \n- bb-e-usd and other linear pools will unpause on June 8th as the grace period on the pause window comes to an end.  This will  allow arbitrageurs to drain remaining value from the pool.\n- This BIP is a actions a plan to unpause the pools early, and run the arbitrage.\n   - Once the exact amount recovered is known, another BIP will be brought forward to proportionally distribute the recovered funds to remaining bb-e-usd holders as of the block of the Arbitrage.\n- After this point, bb-e-usd burns will render a value of almost 0 and will in no case be worth the gas.\n- Special thanks to TempleDAO for providing the eDAI and eUSDC required to run this process.\n\n\n## Background/Context\n\nAs initially described in [this RFC](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/rfc-bb-e-usd-permissioned-arbitrage-to-rescue-non-withdrawn-funds/4744).   There is still a significant amount of value left in bb-e-usd, a vast majority of which belongs to Inverse Finance.  \n\nSince the time of the RFC posted above,  The Balancer Maxis have spent time working with TempleDAO, Euler, and Inverse to ensure that all required conditions are met on-chain to run the arb.   Euler patched a contract, Temple sent eTokens to the Balancer DAO Multisig.  \n\nThe PoC has been improved to use a smart contract, deployed [here](https://etherscan.io/address/0xF23d8342881eDECcED51EA694AC21C2B68440929#code).  This removes most of the issues that could occur between the time the payload was generated and the time the transaction is executed(about a week for governance).\n\nSince the RFC, it was also decided that it would be safer/better not to try to atomically distribute the proceeds from the arbitrage in the same transaction as the arbitrage itself, and instead to do a second BIP/execute at a later date.\n\n## Specification\n\nIf this BIP is passed, the attached payload will be executed as soon as possible.\n\nIt takes the following steps:\n\n1. Grants unpause permissions to Euler Linear Pools to the DAO Multisig.\n2. Unpauses bb-e-usdc and bb-e-dai\n3. Internally transfers all of the eDAI and eUSDC in the DAO Multisig to the helper contract `0xF23d8342881eDECcED51EA694AC21C2B68440929`\n4. calls the do_arb function on the smart contract in order to activate the arbitrage\n5. Removes pause rights from the DAO multisig.\n\nThe Pause window is now in a grace period, so it is not possible to repause the pools.  Following execution of this BIP bb-e-usdc,  bb-e-dai will be in an unpaused state.\n\n### Important Note\nThe payload provided is slightly sensitive to changes in market conditions.  As such there is a dust factor.  This changes the amount of funds left in the pool to handle paying fees for trading the \"wrong direction\" in an off balance linear pool.  Note that these fees could only be collected by an arb who rebalanced the pool, which does not seem very possible/sensible so they should be considered lost value.\n\nInverse is clearly very concerned about recovering their coins.  The Maxi's therefore ask permission to recheck this payload before it is loaded on the DAO multisig, and in the event of a failed simulation,  update the dust factors, currently set to [350,300] as required.  No other changes to the payload will be made.  \n\n## Onward steps\nFollowing execution of this BIP, governance will be brought forward to distribute the proceeds, and internally transfer remaining eTokens back to the TempleDAO multisig. \n\n\n## Review Requirements\nNote that the payload and contract submitted have not been reviewed by anyone outside the Maxis.  This BIP will not be executed until at least 1 review by a trusted and skilled engineers outside the Maxis is posted in response to this forum post.   We welcome anyone interested to complete and post such a review.  A request has been submitted to the Integrations Team to provide said review.\n\n## More about Pausing\nNew Balancer pool types and contracts generally include a 90 day Pause window as part of the launch process.  If Pause is called during this time, a 90 day grace period kicks in, after which point the pool automatically unpauses.  The Euler linear pools had been deployed less than 90 days before the Euler exploit making the pause possible.  Following the end of the pause window, pausing of the pool is no longer possible.\n\nYou can read more about pausing here:\nhttps://forum.balancer.fi/t/proposal-boosted-pools-authorize-balancer-labs-to-emergency-pause/2399\nNote that since this time, pause rights have moved from the blabs ops multisig to the [Emergency SubDAO](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/form-the-emergency-subdao/3197)\nhttps://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-139-update-emergency-subdao-permissions/4174\n\nA full list of current mainnet permissions can be found here:\nhttps://docs.balancer.fi/reference/authorizer/mainnet.html",
