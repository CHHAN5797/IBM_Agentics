        "body": "## ***Summary***\n\nThe London Business School (LBS) Blockchain Society, in alliance with Flipside Governance (@fig), FranklinDAO (@PennBlockchain), the University of Michigan (@Michigan_Blockchain), and Columbia University (@BlockchainAtColumbia), proposes to institute a gas fee rebate mechanism for recognised delegates voting on-chain on Aave.\n\n## ***Motivation***\n\nGas fees on Ethereum have been increasing recently. As shown by data from Dune Analytics, median gas prices sit at around 30 gwei, with intradaily spikes often far exceeding that level. The amount of gas fees required for voting on-chain has therefore risen proportionally, increasing the cost of on-chain governance for delegates (particularly in light of the heavier recent proposal load at Aave).\n\n**![|537x363](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/oDESh98-zthvbro3LnZuiQcCRWRRqMXRcC_HzQNnbdKmKLZ40BN5_Zes9fmVp2kg7tMLV7uAmJKMqHvl-IAH45Ycf17xD-XRzrphEo_oUpREx-AtZYZ6cg0IRjiRB7AjKMPVI9bfyfHxjtr2ybCclrE)**\n\nTo find out more about gas costs on Aave, refer to the following dashboards created by Flipside here:\n\n* https://flipsidecrypto.xyz/janan/aave-delegates-rayk2E\n* https://flipsidecrypto.xyz/alitaslimi/aave-delegates-gas-usage-9LderL\n* https://flipsidecrypto.xyz/Ali3N/aave-delegates-gas-usage-136ks0\n* https://flipsidecrypto.xyz/panda-gXSkiX/aave-gas-usage-on-votes-_zF8ba\n\nLBS Blockchain Society, like other peer universities, is a not-for-profit, student-run organisation that depends on sponsorships and stipends to finance its operations. We currently receive monthly compensation for participating in MakerDAO governance, but otherwise receive no other form or income. Other schools like FranklinDAO (Penn Blockchain) are in very similar states. So far, we have been using this to cover gas costs at Aave, but the cost of on-chain governance remains a growing concern for us.\n\nIn light of this, we see rebating delegates for their participation as having the following benefits:\n\n* Incentivise more active engagement of the delegate community by removing the disincentive to vote. Broader participation leads to better decision-making for Aave.\n* Create a more diverse voter base that includes student organisations such as ours. Reducing the barrier to entry for voting creates a more open, collaborative delegate ecosystem. This in turn drives participation.\n* Retain the best delegates to drive growth of the Aave ecosystem. Aave should remain competitive with its peers (e.g., Maker) to attract and retain the best delegate talent. The fundamental cost of being a great Aave delegate should not be at a net cost to the delegate with regards to spending ever-increasing gas costs.\n* Achievable at relatively low cost. We also outline measures to reduce the administrative burden for Aave below.\n\n## ***Specification***\n\n*Participation Criteria*\n\nTo incentivise maximal voter participation, we propose a participation-based rebate system. Participation is defined by the proportion of proposals, being the sum total of Snapshot polls and AIPs, voted on by a Recognized Delegate over the lesser of: 1) the previous 90 days, or 2) since becoming a Recognized Delegate. A Participation score of 100% would mean that a Delegate has voted on all polls and AIPs over this period. Moreover, only delegate platforms with 10k+ AAVE in voting power will be eligible for gas fee rebates, in order to avoid spam - the 10k is a small enough number to allow for enough delegate participation but filters out any spam.\n\n*Note*: A Recognized Delegate is one with an Aave Delegate Platform, such as the LBS Blockchain Society, University of Michigan, FranklinDAO, Flipside, Llama, Aave Chan Initiative, Stablelabs, etc. The list of Recognized Delegates is open to change over time. A list of Aave Delegate Platforms can be found here, but note that there are a few new platforms and all of them may not have the required 10k AAVE voting power.\n\n|Participation Rate over Previous 90 days|Gas Rebate|\n| --- | --- |\n|>80%|100%|\n|50% to 80%|50%|\n|<50%|0%|\n\n*Claiming Process*\n\nTo reduce the administrative burden for Aave, we propose the claiming process should be initiated by Recognized Delegates themselves. Every month, Recognized Delegates have the option to submit a Gas Rebate Application to Aave, which shall include:\n\n1. The list of transactions associated with voting on Aave proposals over that month\n2. The corresponding gas fees spent on each transaction\n3. Etherscan links detailing the above\n\nDelegates can also choose to batch their Gas Rebate Applications (i.e. submit a single application for multiple months). However, any gas fees not claimed over a 12 month period will be automatically forfeited.\n\nOnce an application has been submitted to Aave, an appointed Governance Facilitator will review the applications and submit an AIP to pay out the gas fees. To that end, we have created a Dune dashboard that the Governance Facilitator can use to calculate the gas costs paid by a specific address, i.e., the address used by delegates to vote. The dashboard can be found [here](https://dune.com/parkyeung/aave-governance-voting-gas-costs). Initially, we propose that the Aave Chan Initiative plays the role of Governance Facilitator.\n\nTo calculate the participation rate for delegates, we recommend using the following formula:\n\n*Number of Proposals Voted on Since First Vote / Total Number of Proposals Since First Vote*\n\nFor example, assume a Delegate Platform’s first vote was on Jan 1 2023. If they apply for a gas rebate on Feb 1 2023, and there have been 20 proposals between Jan 1 and Feb 1, out of which the Delegate has voted for 17 proposals, their participation rate is 85%.\n\nWe are working to publish a tool to easily calculate participation rate for the Governance Facilitator and will update this post once it is ready.\n\nWe propose the funds to be paid from the Ethereum v2 Collector Contract, but defer to the community for guidance on the most appropriate source of funds.\n\n*Gas Rebate Token*\n\nWe consider two options for the Gas Rebate Token: 1) ETH, the native asset in which gas fees are paid, and 2) stablecoins (e.g. USDC, DAI).\n\nThe list of holdings in the Ethereum v2 Collector Contract can be found [here](https://etherscan.io/tokenholdings?a=0x464c71f6c2f760dda6093dcb91c24c39e5d6e18c#assets-wallet).\n\nEach option above has associated trade-offs (for example certain assets may be deemed more strategic than others, or represent larger existing holdings). We would welcome community feedback on the most appropriate asset in advance of voting.\n\n## ***References***\n\nWe have taken inspiration from MakerDAO’s [MIP61: Recognized Delegate Compensation](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP61#performance-modifier).\n\nOther sources include Dune Analytics.\n\n## ***Copyright***\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

The native USDC token will eventually become the \"canon\" version of the USDC stablecoin on the Arbitrum L2. The current USDC onboarded on Aave V3 Arbitrum pool should now be considered \"USDC.e\" as it's a bridged asset with an underlying USDC on Ethereum.\n\n## Motivation\n\nCircle is set to launch a native version of USDC on Arbitrum, which is anticipated to become the primary version of the USDC stablecoin on the Arbitrum L2. This will supersede the current \"USDC.e\" token, which is a bridged asset with an underlying USDC on Ethereum.\n\nFrom our experience with the Avalanche Pool, we've learned that a prudent approach to integrating such a native token involves initially onboarding it with parameters similar to its bridged counterpart, but with more conservative caps. As the native USDC builds secondary liquidity and matures, we can gradually decrease the attractiveness of USDC.e and increase the caps for the native USDC.\n\nThis ARFC is focused solely on the onboarding of the native USDC and does not propose any action for USDC.e. As a result, if this proposal is accepted by the governance, both USDC.e and the native USDC will be onboarded simultaneously on the Arbitrum V3 pool. This strategy aims to ensure a smooth transition and maintain the stability of the Aave V3 pool on Arbitrum.\n\n\n\n## Specification\n\n### Token Information\n\n- Token Symbol: USDC\n- Token Address: [0xaf88d065e77c8cC2239327C5EDb3A432268e5831](https://arbiscan.io/address/0xaf88d065e77c8cC2239327C5EDb3A432268e5831)\n\n### Parameters\n\n| Parameter | USDC.e | USDC (native) |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|LTV|81%|81%|\n|LT|86%|86%|\n|LB|5%|5%|\n|Supply Cap|150M|**41M**|\n|Borrow Cap|100M|**41M**|\n|RF|10%|10%|\n|emode|YES|YES|\n|emode LTV|93%|93%|\n|emode LT|95%|95%|\n|emode LB|1%|1%|\n|Base rate|0%|0%|\n|slope1|3.5%|3.5%|\n|Slope2|60%|60%|\n|optimalUtilization|90%|90%|\n|stable borrowing|YES|NO|\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThis proposal is powered by Skyward.

This would be achieved by integrating sDAI, an ERC-4626 Vault token that includes the DSR yield, into the Aave protocol.\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe DSR is a variable rate set by MakerDAO governance that allows DAI holders to earn savings by locking their DAI into the DSR contract. Recently, MakerDAO governance plans to increase the DSR rate to 3.49%. By integrating the DSR into Aave via sDAI, we can allow Aave liquidity providers to benefit from the DSR rate without additional cost to the Aave DAI borrowers.\n\n## Specification\n\nAt the protocol level, when a user deposits DAI, the protocol will wrap their DAI in the form of sDAI and deliver aDAI to the user. When a user borrows DAI, the protocol will unwrap the stored sDAI, deliver DAI, and accrue the debt amount in DAI.\n\n![image|1920x1563, 40%](upload://fQNJl46MrGPtwEuH6Trg6zzyqNP.jpeg)\n\n## Limitations\n\nThis integration will have the consequence of increasing the gas cost of using DAI in Aave for every user. The exact impact of these gas cost increases should be reviewed and considered by the community during the ARFC stage of this proposal.\n\n## Next Steps\n\nIf this TEMP CHECK receives positive feedback and a Snapshot vote outcome is YAE, the next step would be to draft an ARFC\ndetailing the technical implementation of this integration.\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThe ACI is not paid by makerDAO or any third party to publish this TEMP CHECK.\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

The proposal aims to allocate funds to the Aave Chan Initiative (ACI) treasury for the next six months, enabling us to actively engage in the Aave ecosystem and contribute to its growth and improvement.\n\n## Abstract:\nif this proposal were to be approved by governance, a stream of the allocated budget would be started to the ACI treasury wallet. It will be used to cover various aspects of the ACI's involvement in the Aave community, including team compensation, community engagement, research and development, infrastructure costs & tooling subscriptions, marketing, and communications.\n\n## Motivation:\nThe Aave Chan Initiative has been a dedicated contributor to the Aave ecosystem. The 6-Month Budget Proposal aims to secure the necessary resources to continue the ACI's work, ensuring that we can maintain our level of commitment and contribution to the Aave ecosystem. For more details about the ACI proposal, please refers to the [TEMP CHECK version of the current proposal](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-aave-chan-initiative-6-month-budget-proposal/12344)\n\n## Specification:\nIf this proposal is approved, a stream of the allocated budget will be activated, with `treasury.aavechan.eth` (0x57ab7ee15cE5ECacB1aB84EE42D5A9d0d8112922) as the recipient. This will allow the ACI to periodically claim a fraction of the budget for the duration of the stream.\n\nIn terms of technical implementation, the AIP will call the `createStream()` method of the `IAaveEcosystemReserveController` interface to create a 180-day stream of 250,000 aUSDT.\n\n## Disclaimer:\nThe Aave Chan Initiative is an independent organization focused on contributing to the Aave ecosystem. This proposal was not commissioned or paid for by any third party.\n\n## Copyright:\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.",
