Aave Grants DAO is a community-led grants program, focused on growing a thriving ecosystem of contributors within Aave through funding ideas, projects and events that benefit the ecosystem. We aim to drive development on top of Aave and ensure a constant influx of talented builders to maintain Aaveâ€™s long term growth. We help build culture and community around the Aave ecosystem that in turn attracts the best contributors.\n\nMore details, including stats on AGD's grant distributions, can be found in our renewal post: https://governance.aave.com/t/aave-grants-dao-update-and-renewal/7842. \n",

We hope to deepen our engagement with the community and ensure that Aave is a market-leading protocol for many decades to come.\n\nLlama has received grants from Aave Grants DAO over the past 12 months for work that includes treasury management, protocol upgrades, DAO to DAO partnerships, and analytics. Aave Grants has recommended that we move from short-term grants to a longer-term work scope funded through governance, allowing us to drive more impact to the Aave ecosystem.\n\n# Links\n\nA detailed list of deliverables we will work on are covered in our [forum post](https://governance.aave.com/t/updated-proposal-llama-aave/9924).\n\nWe have incorporated feedback from several Aave contributors and stakeholders. We have received support for our proposal and hope to move it to the next stage.\n",
