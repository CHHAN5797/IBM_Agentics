        "title": "[TEMP CHECK] Aave Chan Initiative 6-Month Budget Proposal",
        "author": "0x329c54289Ff5D6B7b7daE13592C6B1EDA1543eD4",
        "body": "## **Introduction**\n\nThe Aave Chan Initiative (ACI) is a delegate platform dedicated to actively participating in Aave governance and contributing to the protocol's success. As the Aave ecosystem matures, it is essential to have diverse and independent delegate platforms to drive the protocol forward.\n\nTo continue our efforts and effectively serve the Aave community, we are seeking a 6-month budget allocation. This budget will support our ongoing initiatives and enable us to expand our team and resources for maximum impact.\n\n## **ACI's current & future areas of focus**\n\n1. **Governance and AIP Development**\n    - Active participation in Aave governance discussions & votes\n    - Developing and submitting snapshot votes & AIPs\n    - Engaging with the community on forum discussions\n    - Collaborating with other delegates and stakeholders\n2. **Treasury Efficiency and Management**\n    - Collaborate with DAO service contributors, such as Llama, to enhance Aave DAO treasury management.\n    - Support initiatives and actively participate in efforts to improve treasury efficiency, led by Llama and other contributors.\n    - Drive the adoption of strategic investments, diversification, and risk mitigation in treasury allocation.\n    - Establish a cost-conscious culture and ensure responsible spending from the treasury for the benefit of the Aave protocol and its users.\n3. **Protocol and Ecosystem Development**\n    - Support the onboarding of new stablecoins, strategic assets, and LSDs\n    - Explore synergies with other DeFi platforms (e.g., Curve, Balancer, Arrakis)\n    - Promote the use of yield-bearing assets and LP tokens as collateral\n    - Participate in discussions around GHO and Safety Module improvements and advocate for “Real Yield” revenue for the Safety module paid in GHO\n    - Support the expansion of Aave markets in “new Frontiers” networks\n4. **Research and Analysis**\n    - Conduct in-depth research on DeFi trends and developments\n    - Provide insights and recommendations to the Aave community\n    - Analyze the performance and impact of Aave governance decisions\n    - Assess new risk mitigation strategies and techniques\n5. **Team Expansion and Operations**\n    - Grow the ACI team to support the Aave ecosystem better\n    - Cover operational expenses, including tools, subscriptions, and infrastructure\n    - Foster a collaborative environment for continuous learning and improvement\n    - Start a “Meta-Governance” focus for ACI. While the ACI can be considered “Aave-Maximalist,” there’s a lot of potential for having an active presence in other DeFi DAOs and representing Aave-DAO interest there, compared to other “professional” delegates, the laser-focus of ACI on Aave DAO interest will allow to have a voice focused on Aave synergies with other actors of the ecosystem.\n6. **Independence & Transparency**\n    - While the ACI grew to become the largest Aave DAO delegate platform, we are proud that our voting power originates from hundreds of individuals from the community that decided to trust the ACI with their voting and proposal power.\n   - To the best of our knowledge, the ACI voting & proposal power is not linked to any specific entity, Investment firm, or third-party protocol, allowing the ACI to remain 100% independent & focus on the benefit of the Aave protocol.\n   - The ACI firmly declined any form of third-party compensation for creating proposals & publishing AIPs as it would be against our independence ethos. The ACI works for the Aave DAO solely & uniquely.\n   - The ACI created & self-imposed mandatory disclosure on every proposal and will continue to support a transparency culture within the Aave DAO.\n\n## **Previous Work**\n\nHere are some notable achievements and contributions made by the Aave Chan Initiative:\n\n- **Governance Coordination**: The ACI actively supported governance participation & coordination; since the Launch of the ACI, exactly **ZERO** AIPs have failed to meet a 320k AAVE vote participation, while it was unfortunately common in 2022.\n- **AIPs**: The ACI presented and created numerous AIPs that have successfully been implemented to improve the Aave protocol. Since the Launch of the ACI, The AAVE DAO is now the most Active major DeFI DAO in the ecosystem. Q1 2023 was the most active quarter in terms of governance ever for Aave.\n    \n- **Governance improvement**: The ACI is actively involved in improving governance efficiency by providing the community with new frameworks, templates, fast-tracks & shortcuts to make Aave as efficient as possible.\n- **Delegators & contributor coordination:** The ACI actively worked with and supported other DAO delegates, contributors, community members & third-party actors by providing feedback on their proposals, technical support when needed, and doing numerous “co-authorship” synergies with other DAO actors.\n\n## **Requested Budget**\n\nWe are requesting a total budget of $250,000 for 6 months period to support our initiatives, team expansion, and operations. This budget will help us:\n\n- Sustainably continue our current work\n- Cover operational expenses, including tools, subscriptions, and infrastructure required to support our work\n- Grow the ACI team, allowing us to better serve the Aave community and expand our areas of focus. While the “One-Man Army” meme is fun, the current workload and ambitions for the future are not compatible with a single-person operation\n- Establish an active presence in other DeFi DAOs, representing Aave-DAO interests and exploring synergies with other actors in the ecosystem\n\nBy securing this budget, the Aave Chan Initiative will be in a sustainable position to continue to provide value to the Aave ecosystem.\n\n## **Next Steps**\n\nIf the TEMP CHECK is successful and the community supports our proposal, we will move forward with a formal ARFC submission detailing the proposal's specifics such as technical implementation of the proposal.\nWe commit to maintaining transparency throughout the process and regularly updating the community on our progress.\n\nThank you for considering our proposal. We appreciate your support and look forward to working together to drive the success of the Aave protocol.",

These rewards allow Aave to attract deposits, where up to 30% can be used to insure the protocol in case of shortfall event. At the moment, 100% of these incentives are spent in liquidity mining from the Ecosystem Reserve, which represents $89.3K daily or $32.6M yearly expense for the DAO.\n\nThis publication presents the community with an opportunity to reshape how AAVE incentives are distributed to significantly improve Aave’s economics and enhance the capital efficiency of the SM.\n\n* Increased Backstop Value\n* Decreased AAVE Spend\n* Increased Yield for depositors\n* Improved Profitability and Financial Sustainability\n\nThis publication focuses on how incentives are distributed to reduce the overall AAVE spend without exceeding the current AAVE budget & shares the estimated results from the strategy.\n\n# Rationale\n\nA quick recap of proposed from the current design so far:\n\n* Part I - SstkABPT update proposal (Part I)\n  * Support of the migration to a new BPT B-80-AAVE-20wstETH\n\n* Part II - Categories implementation (Part II)\n  * Single assets, volatile BPTs and stable BPTs.\n\n* Part II- Slashing update (Part II)\n  * Each category will have a different max slashing parameter\n\n* Part III -BPT positions staked on the SM - smBPTs (Part III)\n  * Create gauges for smBPTon staked assets and enable users to receive to avoid incentives dilution, Introduce smBPT wrapper, and explain Aura Finance strategy to receive BAL & AURA rewards.\n\nThis publication presents a revised outlook on how the majority of the current AAVE budget could be distributed as vote incentives for smBPT gauges. Additionally, the DAO could decide to optimize its strategic voting power to reduce the SM costs.\n\nDo note the APR generated from depositing into the SM has dependencies such as the BAL, AURA and AAVE token prices. If this proposal is approved, several solutions can be explored to reduce this risk. If it becomes unprofitable over time because of BAL or AURA prices, a fallback option can be added to switch back to the current LM design if needed until finding a better optimization.\n\nThe design is flexible enough to accommodate various market conditions and for Aave to pivot from AAVE to GHO rewards over time. This represents a shift on the base incentives from Aave governance token distribution to yield derived from cash flow sustained by the business.This will allow to improve the fallback option to always optimize the best yield between direct profit sharing distributed or used to leverage more yield through votes incentives.\n\n## veBAL Voting Power\n\nLlama recently published a proposal to deploy the BAL holdings. This proposal will help provide a better understanding of why Llama recommended the community to vote for acquiring veBAL.\n\nOverview of the veBAL position if locked today:\n\n![|566x186](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/2xlP4WbgttqDygSf06fk1AyRlqdq8JgW_xVGyPyZnkcNpN9EEGFfY_H_VMcVozZY9mrdzrQrp37PxbXQkSUxTjHYvsavlxyvvFFGqoHp80eLqjc7owdYdFugJ40Tp7xs2nbYZoKnNRk7dWkO9wzx5CA)\n\nETH needed and the LP tokens amount received are verified with https://balancer.tools/veBAL.\n\n![|414x79](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/LECeCOxUTEB4UlvHAyEaCa3FEImGhUYGdDxKUCULK_eqW7dU9V4MaEF70AH6pJFHOMSjM-KaCjcJ-T_l8qG_sSu-L611Ctjk6JejFn6pDxWe1r13IIa9dsVQ2mYsgykdgYqIyFO2LqE73491CcNtjE0)\n\nThe table above shows how much weekly BAL emission is controlled, assuming the DAO uses only its owned veBAL voting power (i.e. without creating vote incentives).These calculations are based on the BAL emission in April 2023: 121,930 BAL/week instead of 145,000 until March 2023.\n\nAave DAO voting power is a good start and can be utilized to support, not limited to, the below strategies:\n\n* Help sustain the Safety Module yield\n* Grow and sustain the GHO liquidity\n* Boost the Staked aTokens gauges\n* Redirect incentives on existing Balancer pools\n* Optimize the yield on treasury strategies\n\nHowever, due to the limited veBAL holding size relative to Aave’s aspirations, the community will need to choose between the choices above. Several other possibilities to increase the strategic voting power accumulation in addition to the reserve factors earnings are presented below:\n\n* [Deploy treasury strategies to farm BAL/AURA with stables & ETH](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-deploy-ethereum-collector-contract/12205)\n\n* [Acquire more BAL/start acquire AURA with the treasury to lock it ](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-strategic-partnership-with-balancer-part-2/7813)\n* Potential Grants from Aura & Balancer\n\n## Safety Module Cover Overview\n\nAssuming that 100% of the Aave TVL was covered by the SM, the DAO would pay 30,02% on its insurance.\n\n![|602x59](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/_4IccaU07Rbv86PhERhDx1iYKoJDNE01HRG31zy3tSaqw0OAn_RY8AufyPgdDFLddVifzmD4xQmow_tzDYmH7yzg7gTbRUEu94dP_AgnVEl5sbwx5GviMWSSMue0ulB1eFAn5HTE0QgBNF4rBqGWgSI)\n\n(1.43% of the TVL is currently covered and the DAO which pays 30,02% APR on these funds). The new strategy aims to increase the Safety Module coverage above 2.00% while also reducing insurance costs by at least 30%.\n\n## Incentives Distribution Upgrade\n\nNote that all TVLs below have been added to estimate the max capacity of the SM with the current budget by maintaining the APR in range.\n\n### Single Assets\n\nThis publication features continuing the rewards with 25% of the current budget for single assets. At a later date, the community can explore progressively replacing AAVE with GHO rewards.\n\n* AAVE: TVL Estimation used for the upcoming calculations:\n\n60% of the current stkAAVE TVL\n\nWe estimate a reduction of the TVL due to the APR lowered by the budget reallocation\n\n(200 AAVE/day until GHO is live vs 550 AAVE/day at the moment.) .\n\n* ETH / stETH: TVL Estimation used for the upcoming calculations:\n\n75k ETH / stETH\n\n(Llama proposes to allocate a budget of 75 AAVE/day to reward ETH and/or stETH deposits until GHO is live)\n\nThis means reducing the liquidity mining by focusing it on single assets only, since it’s not possible to add gauges for it. The remaining AAVE currently being spent in LM to incentivize both veBAL & vlAURA voters on Warden Quest, which allows to redirect rewards on smBPTs gauges, in a better proportion than LM.\n\n## What is Warden Quest?\n\nWarden Quest by Paladin, offers a new approach to Gauge Weight vote acquisition for Curve & Balancer. Instead of offering an arbitrary amount of rewards to influence voters, Quest allows players to set parameters & rewards for each weekly vote period.\n\nAfter the rewards distribution to voters, if the total budget wasn't spent (i.e.,if the objective wasn't reached), Quest creators can redeem the unspent budget minus the fees.\n\nAdditionally, Quest now offers the possibility for vlAURA holders to claim rewards from veBAL quests, allowing Aave DAO to create vote incentives for both at once.\n\nFinally, with the estimated budget of this post, Quest fees would be at 2,8% instead of 4%.\n\nNote: This proposal doesn’t plan to create vote incentives on the StakedATokens gauges, but the DAO could vote to do it later. In such a case, the Quest weekly volume would lead to the lowest fee possible: 2%. More information on Warden Quest can be found [here](https://doc.paladin.vote/warden-quest/introduction).\n\n## Volatile & Stable BPTs\n\nThe SM Upgrade strategy aims to maintain the volatile BPTs APR in the 8 to 12% range, and the stable BPTs APR in the 18 to 22% range. The BAL & AURA rewards could be distributed weekly to SM depositors.\n\n* B-80AAVE-20wstETH: Max TVL estimation used: $100M\n\n* B-80GHO-20wETH: Max TVL estimation used: $50M$\n\n* B-GHO-3Pool: Max TVL estimation used: $100M\n\n![|602x132](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/SpKMcUQtiB4wEV4_28TEmzln1kV-XvgxaMWl8b7Gskws4NyE3R4_s4sGxGCBSzI8EDv254g8Jep_kTdi74E4OEEzYijcNq56-6Kxp-0KGO2_NrquOGi0ll3R-RtSEB9XO2oAqzoR9sFhHQWkGr6Gpfw)\n\nThese estimations demonstrate the possibility of reaching the APR targets outlined above.\n\nThe vlAURA votes amount needed is defined by a target in veBAL votes, which is why the total exceeds 100% of the vlAURA supply.The veBAL votes target can be reached by creating vote incentives for veBAL, vlAURA, veTETU and sdBAL, all supported on Quest.\n\nNote: veTETU vote incentives would require more management as veTETU on Polygon, so we’ve excluded it from this proposal for now. sdBAL vote incentives are also excluded because of the small veBAL holdings.\n\n![|602x152](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/64YqdC6KmmZAUULAUOg71tPIv1c0B1bLlomXQ6jJVgcwf18mWUMAcZhdcBvdLhi7NjPLJYoTftfl2YPxsZ179v8u_ogbq0Es3U61gptCID7YD1QnxsNL61f3bfMhaRz4N1669rUJTy9jGyy4SyjN4R0)\n\n(Yellow cells are manually added & Orange cells are max estimated TVL. The remaining data are calculated or imported from Etherscan and CoinGecko data in real time, so numbers are changing very often depending on all the variables).\n\n## smBPTs Quests Results Overview\n\n![|602x83](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/xmMXkpyZUu4J7HJC9r_b0lZyKGiWp-_LXkst-HVh9QRFTuHuMXCiWC0aNI_aOdckGrvTfu1Zt6Q9uLKFDRfqaFT9vZUOLIbsDe04lrjVEppw9sb8li1bbpVKsTkZZc3ACHIhUQkcQzx_6z1mEokw7bM)\n\nThe cost per vlAURA/round is from [Llama Airforce](https://llama.airforce/#/bribes/rounds/hh/aura-bal/8).\n\nThe vlAURA votes are priced 2% above the last round's prices, as this market does fluctuate a lot (1 round = 2 weeks). Aave would need to control ~30,08% of the veBAL voting supply on the SM gauges to reach the target APRs shown above.\n\nThe table above demonstrates that Aura is way more interesting than Balancer without max boost. Creating the same vote incentives but farming on Balancer would not be profitable.\n\nIn this strategy, the SM depositors would earn $194,000/round ($97,000/week) in extra BAL & AURA rewards directed with votes incentives compared to AAVE tokens liquidity mining distribution.\n\nWhile the TVL max estimations are high in this proposal, this helped define the max capacity of this strategy with the current budget, evaluate the yield possibilities, and learnt the communities sentiment. However, the goal is to progressively increase the TVL target & associated votes incentives budget.\n\nThe requested amount of votes and rewards requires an active management to optimize the Quests, which is why this publication leans away from using Snapshot to determine Aave’s veBAL gauges votes and instead recommends considering different options to optimize the votes, which will be presented in the voting framework proposed in the coming days.\n\nIf the Quests are not filled, the unspent rewards can be redeemed by the DAO (minus the fees) and used for the next round. In this case, a fallback budget should be planned to temporarly compensate part of the yield in liquidity mining initially, then in GHO over time. .\n\nTo avoid this to happen, the strategy considers paying slightly more per vote than the market based on previous round price, to align the economic interest of the protocol and the voters to make sure the votes target are reached. OTC deals could also be discussed with important voters in this ecosystem.\n\n![|706x118](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/zTMjQiAa0TUwZ5MiVQPW9OROSRkoRj1XhD6LuEFdL0hK_TGp713OdJOv1R7a9SZuuWJP3Dm9wlXoPSf878NSzbr9Q9E74Yd3iwpRfNwwNc-uQjPLTwlVTK85No_OmJ3wdVjiROx1ocIh1pCauoAGGE4)\n\nThe AAVE amount spent in vote incentives in the table below is changing very often as defined by several parameters, such as the amount of votes required, the price for veBAL & vlAURA votes, the AAVE token price, the TVL in the smBPT gauges, and later on, governance updates on the SM design proposed if the budget is changed.\n\nWith the above estimations, there is a reduction of the daily LM budget, which can be accumulated as a fallback budget to avoid the unfavorable situation explained above.\n\n![|368x81](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/7RQIzjSHyb9w7XIsffWS78g0smGilUe8Dco3vuymbmWPRBTak9Darub-3m7FLuDTULG17gYabPNiAoq3DDScnWkttSAJJzx7-s28LQBjBEtlSJYRWpqm0kIwyLBtwF5BUsmmfoqQuwcyTEt4PuMpH-I)\n\nAs expected, the cover cost (insurance APR) is also reduced by half, which validates the last goal of this proposal.\n\n![|515x271](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/tR9EqP3W5s0SMSNuM5QnBfwq_dSnrZm3OAlylx5AAG7ExYpDgSNDLizhWMpukSfKhEEWtUw9yBxr-_xHvcBSeFkPpaLKDoFgl_7LYBO0t2Wh7TpMxxxzbN8rRhAPPE7ec-Vzh5HalS1-xsdsEZ3Lkag)\n\nThe last table in Part IV and the 2 above demonstrate that with current market metrics & estimated TVL, the APRs reached on Aura are in the range expected, as well as the average insurance cost reduction from 30,02% to 17,23% and the cover increase from $119M to $175M.\n\nAlso, considering that this strategy will help with both growing the SM (TVL & Cover) and improving the liquidity for Aave tokens, other incentive budgets for GHO liquidity or liquidity mining on StakedATokens could be used for the same strategy.\n\nActions related to the strategic voting power and votes incentives management will be defined by the framework proposal defined in part V, such as:\n\n* Lock veToken assets into Balancer and Aura to generate increased rewards.\n* Create votes incentives on Quest\n* Update the boost power, delegate or sell it on Warden if unused.\n* Vote on gauges & proposals decisions\n* Claim protocol fees\n\n# Technical Implementations:\n\n* Enable weekly distribution for Stable & Volatile BPT rewards\n* Whitelist the AAVE token on Quest as reward (No extra proposal needed)\n* Define the Aave voting framework (Part V)\n\n# Voting options:\n\nYAE - Update the incentives management strategy\nNAE - Continue classic liquidity mining\nABSTAIN\n\n# Disclaimer\n\nThe Llama is not compensated by any of the mentioned communities outside of Aave.\n\nLlama is an unpaid delegate within the Balancer ecosystem.

A later proposal will detail pool sizes, yield estimates and how this could after the $1 peg.\n\n# Introduction\n\nWhen shaping the liquidity strategy for GHO, we assessed various options with three main considerations:\n\n* Trading Pair\n* Decentralised Exchange (pool type)\n* Holistic Business Strategy\n\nThe largest trading pairs in Defi are ETH and USDC. For this reason we favour creating a USD stable coin liquidity pool and a LST / GHO liquidity pool.\n\n* USD stable coin liquidity pool\n* LST liquidity pool\n\nDeep stable coin liquidity helps GHO to retain it's $1 peg. Arbitrage trading is profitable with small price variations at large trade sizes. Therefore it is important to create a liquidity pool sufficient in size to facilitate large trade sizes with minimal price impact.\n\nAt launch, it is reasonable to expect volatility and minimal integrations in place at launch. As a result, the initial bootstraping phase is to be heavily dependent upon incentives to sustain liquidity and create peg resilience. When a spot price based oracle becomes available, we expect more sophisticated peg arbitrage strategies to become more readily available as yield strategy for various collateral types.\n\nThe Aave DAO and friend's veBAL holding is expected to play a material role in bootstrapping liquidity. Based upon our initial conversations, we believe Aave DAO will receive support in the form of veBAL to bootstrap GHO liquidity pools on Balancer.\n\n* Aave DAO\n* Reallocation of Protocol Fee Vote Incentive (PFVI)\n* Balancer Community Members\n* Aura Finance Community Members\n* Potentially Liquity\n* And Others\n\nAlthough gauges take some time to deploy, we anticipate the gauges being in production within as little as 1 week after launch.\n\n## Safety Module Considerations\n\nThe most dominant stable coins in Defi have centralised dependencies such as multisigs and off-chain counterparty risks etc... These centralised dependencies are less suitable for inclusion the SM. Similarly, any pool that includes an Aave Linear Pool, or aToken, shall be excluded from the SM due to systemic risk.\n\nThe following types of pools and assets are excluded from the SM:\n\n* Aave Linear Pools\n* USDC\n\nAdding GHO liquidity tokens into the SM helps achieve the following:\n\n* Sustain GHO liquidity\n* Diversifies the SM assets \n* GHO revenue slightly offsets SM costs\n\nLUSD is immutable and the most decentralised stable coin making it ideal for inclusion in the SM. More on this later. \n\n## Sustainability\n\nA key benefit of Aave Linear pools is that they deposit liquidity in Aave v3 and growing the Aave Boosted Pool on Balancer offers strategic benefit to Aave. A portion of yield derived from Aave Protocol is used attain BAL incentives, 32.5%. Lido DAO and Rocket Pool have both grown liquidity pools that can be mostly sustained by veBAL votes attained from Balancer's PFVI flywheel.\n\nThere is also the ability for Balancer DAO to redirect protocol fees used for bribing from the Aave Boosted Pool (bb-a-USD) towards the GHO/bb-a-USD or LST/GHO pool. The bb-a-USD pool currently has [$28.2M](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0xfebb0bbf162e64fb9d0dfe186e517d84c395f016000000000000000000000502) of liquidity. \n\nNaturally, TokenLogic can work with the Balancer community to redirect Balancer protocol fee funded vote incentives to preferential pools.\n\nGiven the DAO's veBAL holding, our preference is for the primary pool to be on Balancer where BAL incentives will exceed the trading fee revenue generated on other DEXs. Curve and Convex are further progressed along there inflation schedule relative to Balancer and Aura. Therefore, whilst minimising dependencies on non Aave DAO voters, Balancer is a relatively better option than curve. We do support the CRV/sdCRV position be used to support GHO on Curve Finance.\n\nWith respect to the 80/20 pool, by having a larger allocation to an Yield Bearing Token (YBT), more yield is generated to fund vote incentives via the PFVI mechanism. Aave will have the option to incorporate this pool into the SM and the emissions will lead to reduced SM expenditure over time.\n\n## Primary Liquidity Pools\n\nWe propose the following primary liquidity pools for GHO:\n\n1) GHO / bb-a-USD - ComposableStablePoolFactory\n2) LST / GHO (80/20) - Weighted Pool Factory\n3) GHO / LUSD - ComposableStablePoolFactory\n\nOf the three pools, pools 1 and 2 qualify as core pools on Balancer with >50% of the pool generating yield.\n\nWith the SM integration being very unlikely at launch, we view adding BPTS to the SM as a longer term GHO growth option for the community to consider. The Aave SM budget is expected to be the main source of incentives for sustaining the GHO/LUSD pool which contains no YBT and does not qualify as a Core Pool on Balancer. \n\nUpon completing the SM upgrade, the PFVI and SM budget can be reallocated. For example, pool 2 PFVI *could* be redirected to pool 1 because pool 2 and 3 are sustained from the SM budget. The SM integration has the potential to create long lasting and sustained liquidity for GHO. It also could lead to additional assets being sustained within the SM using the same budget. \n\nDiscussions with Liquity relating to LUSD/GHO pool are promising. Liquity has a small vlAURA holding which can be used to support liquidity on Balancer. Gauges can be created when GHO is launched and then, if the Aave community supports the BPT being added to the SM, a new smBPT gauge can be deployed.\n\nWith the prospect of the LST/GHO pool being added to the SM, we are open to LST communities commenting below and volunteering initiatives that support growing this pool.\n\n## Secondary Pools\n\nEvery liquidity pool that contains GHO is positive for the Aave ecosystem. Therefore, we are open to experimenting and working with as many teams as possible. \n\nTo summaries, the following GHO secondary pools are being explored on a variety of DEXs:\n\n* GHO / FRAX\n* GHO / MAI\n* GHO / OHM\n\nSeveral teams are keen to incorporate and support GHO liquidity pools. A GHO / FRAXBP pool is one example within the Curve Finance ecosystem and other early integrations could include Olympus, Sommelier, Mellow, Maverick, Uniswap, Swaap and MAI Finance (Qi DAO) and more. \n\nWe favour creating many secondary liquidity pools over time across a variety of protocols.\n\n# Future Considerations\n\nThe following considerations will influence the expected size of the liquidity pools:\n\n* GHO Supply cap (100M units)\n* veBAL support beyond Aave DAO\n* vlAURA support\n\n# Specification\n\nGHO primary pools on Balancer v2 are shown below:\n\n1) GHO / bb-a-USD - ComposableStablePoolFactory\n2) LST / GHO (80/20) - Weighted Pool Factory\n3) GHO / LUSD - ComposableStablePoolFactory\n\n# Next Steps\n\nAfter discussing and agreeing upon the GHO liquidity Pools, we will prepare a proposal for sizing the liquidity pools and present a plan for how to grow the liquidity.\n\nWe are hoping for comments below that indicate support from other communities which we will incorporate into the next proposal.\n\n# Disclaimer\n\n@TokenLogic currently receives funding from the Butter Delegate Campaign and is a contributor @Llamaxyz.

        "body": "---\n\n[ARFC] Deploy BAL & aBAL from the Collector Contract\nAuthor: @llamaxyz - DeFi_Consulting (@MatthewGraham) and @dydymoon\nCreated: 2023-02-05 (updated)\n\n---\n\n# Simple Summary\n\nThis proposal presents two options for deploying the approximately 100k BAL tokens being acquired by AIP 115 and the aBAL holding in the Ethereum Collector Contract, [1].\n\n# Abstract\n\nAIP 115 has been successfully implemented and Aave has acquired an additional 100k BAL on market. The total BAL and aBAL holding is now 308,978.30. With 200k BAL already committed to veBAL, this proposal will determine how to deploy the remaining 108,978.30 BAL with the overall objective of maximizing the growth potential of Aave, [4,16].\n\nAave Snapshot voters can choose between two options, each of which has varying degrees of complexity and represents different means of achieving similar goals over different time horizons.\n\nOption 1) Locking veBAL.\nOption 2) Staking auraBAL.\n\nOption 1) is about locking B-80BAL-20WETH enabling Aave to participate in Balancer gauge and governance votes, and benefit from the Liquidity Provider (LP) boosting and protocol fees earnings.\n\nOption 2) focuses on yield, forgoes governance influence (participating in votes) and presents a higher yield investment strategy that over time, will lead to more governance influence relative to Option 1).\n\nA Snapshot will be posted enabling the community to choose between both options. Llama recommends voting for Option 1).\n\n# Motivation\n\nThis BAL holding has been acquired by the Aave with the goal of supporting Aave lending market adoption. In pursuit of driving growth to the Aave markets, the BAL holding needs to be deployed and utilised.\n\nAave has the following BAL and aBAL holdings on Ethereum:\n\n* 200k BAL acquired via a token swap with Balancer DAO, [1].\n* 100k BAL acquired via an on market acquisition swap contract, [4].\n* 8,978.30 aBAL acquired through user borrowing BAL on Aave, [10].\n\nThis proposal will focus on how best to deploy the 100k BAL and 8,978.30 aBAL.\n\n## Option 1) Locking veBAL\n\nThe Balancer Liquidity Mining system is an automated program which governs the minting of all BAL tokens based on on-chain voting by veBAL holders. veBAL is obtained by joining the canonical 80/20 BAL/ETH Weighted Pool and then locking the Pool shares token (often called BPT, for 'Balancer Pool Token') for a time duration. The longer the 80/20 BPT is locked for, the more veBAL and voting power is obtained.\n\nIn Option 1), Aave DAO converts all BAL (incl. Redeem aBAL for BAL) with sufficient WETH to B-80BAL-20WETH. The B-80BAL-20WETH token is then deposited into the VotingEscrow veBAL contract and locked for the maximum duration, 1 year. This proposal will acquire the B-80BAL-20WETH and explain the goals of utilising the veBAL holdings while a separate proposal will detail how the veBAL is to be managed before being deployed to veBAL.\n\n### What’s veBAL ?\n\nveBAL are not transferable and the voting influence decays on the veTokens balance over time requiring the veBAL to be relocked periodically to maintain maximum voting influence. The B-80BAL-20WETH can be locked from 1 week to 1 year. Ie: 1 B-80BAL-20WETH locked 1 year = 1 veBAL, locked 6 months = 0,5 veBAL etc\n\n* **Gauge-weight Power**\nVoting power which influences the BAL emissions on the different gauges. The votes happen every week on Balancer governance. It can be used for several goals which will be described later on this post.\n\n* **Governance Power**\nVoting influence in Balancer DAO proposals. Since Balancer DAO utilities off-chain governance, the voting power can be delegated via Snapshot. Note: Llama is currently a Balancer DAO delegate.\n\n* **veBoost**\nLocking B-80BAL-20WETH earns a boost of up to 2.5x on the liquidity provided on Balancer.\n\n* **Protocol Fees**\n75% of all trading fees consolidated for bb-a-USD (stable) + BAL coming from the veBAL gauge are distributed to lockers, [9].\n\n### veBAL Position Overview\n\nBy maximising the veBAL holding and using over 308.9K BAL with the proportional amount of WETH (326.88) for a combined worth of $2,719,000 at the time of writing, Aave would receive an estimated ~153,520.38 units of B-80BAL-20WETH. Converted to veBAL, the ~153,520.38 units would represent approximately 1.10% of the BPT liquidity and 1.40% of the veBAL supply. Aave would be one of the largest veBAL holders along with Aave Companies, [5].\n\nWith 145,000 BAL tokens currently being minted and distributed each week across four networks and Aave holding 1.40% of veBAL supply, this is equivalent to controlling the distribution of 2036 BAL per week, or $14,496 per week ($753,8080 per year, assuming a BAL price $7.12).\n\nBAL emissions reduce yearly as per the inflation schedule and the next reduction will occur at the end of March 2023, pivoting from 145,000 to 121,930 BAL/week. With 2023 emission and the same veBAL share, Aave would be able to redirect 1,712 BAL/week, or $12,189 per week or $633,850 per year, assuming a BAL price at $7.12.\n\nAave can utilise its veBAL holdings to support, not limited to, the below strategies:\n\n* Redirect incentives on existing Balancer pools\n* Optimise the yield on treasury strategies\n* Bootstrap the Staked aToken Reserves\n* Grow and sustain the GHO liquidity\n* Help sustain the Safety Module yield\n\nThe boost amount received depends on the value of the funds deposited and the relative sizing of the veBAL holding. The boost can be used directly on the Collector Contract but considering the amounts of available funds, the boost is unlikely to be sufficient to boost all of Aave’s positions in Balancer Liquidity Pools. Therefore, it is likely any treasury strategies will be a mix of both depositing into Balancer gauges directly or via Aura Finance.\n\nThere remains the possibility to sell the veBoost on secondary markets like Warden, [6].\n\n### veBAL yield overview\n\nThe veTokens yield can vary a lot depending on several parameters:\n\n* bb-a-USD fees depends on the trading volume (Swap fee: 0.67% APR)\n* BAL rewards are coming from the veBAL gauge (BAL rewards: up to 0.91% APR)\n* The veBoost yield is hard to estimate as it won’t be the same if used on POL (up to 2.5x the yield), or sold\n\nIn the second case, the current minimum price listed on Warden is 0.00014 BAL/veBAL/week\n\nveBoost if sold: from 0.27% APR with a BAL price of 7.14$ and a veBAL price of $18.92\n\n* Bribes: The biggest variation on the veBAL yield comes from the bribes received for the gauge weight power. Last week, the average cost was ~$0.085/veBAL vote/week. Gauges weight APR: 23.3%.\n\nIt’s important to note that the yield impact is better when some funds are deployed in strategies, farming boosted rewards on the pools voted.\n\n## Option 2) Staking auraBAL\n\nOption 2) maximises earning whilst forgoing Aave’s ability to participate in BAL emission distribution votes. Both Option 1) and 2) involve obtaining the B-80BAL-20WETH position.\n\nAfter the B-80BAL-20WETH position is obtained, Aave could deposit it into Aura Finance’s auraBAL wrapper contract to earn staking yield in the several forms (1.87% stables (bb-a-USD), 24.09% in BAL and 34.59% in AURA for a total of 60.56% APR), [8].\n\nDepositing into the B-80BAL-20WETH/Aura pool and staking the BPT was considered, however this is more complex to execute and maintain for margin additional yield.\n\nThe yield received from the auraBAL holding can be compounded to earn additional yield.\n\n* BAL (24.09% of 60.56%): BAL, aBAL and WETH from the Collector Contract can be swapped for B-80BAL-20WETH and staked on Aura Finance.\n* bb-a-USD (1.87% of 60.56%): bb-a-USD can be deposited on Aura to earn 6.53% in (0.06% swap fees, 0.83% bb-a-USD, 2.30% BAL, 3.35% AURA).\n* AURA (34.67% of 60.32%): AURA can be locked for vlAURA and used to vote where BAL and AURA incentives will be directed. The vlAURA position generates around 3.34% in auraBAL as well as gives vote weight for proposal and gauge weight voting, [11]. The vlAURA lock period is 16 weeks and 4 days, depending on locking date and after this time, the AURA can be redeemed and swapped.\n\nGrowing a vlAURA position over time in addition to the veBAL one will increase the total voting power controlled over time, which will help to drive TVL to Aave markets and generate more earnings.\n\nWith 200K BAL from the token swap + WETH to be deposited in veBAL and 108,978.30 BAL + WETH into the auraBAL staking contract, Aave will own ~54,220 auraBAL and ~99,600 veBAL.\n\nBy staking 54,220 auraBAL, Aave DAO will hold approximately 1,99% of the auraBAL supply, [7].\n\nOption 2) is focused on depositing B-80BAL-20WETH on Aura to earn more BAL & AURA rewards.\n\n## Comments\n\nTo help with the decision making, the table below presents some pros and cons of each approach. The TL;DR: veBAL has an immediate impact whilst auraBAL is a longer term, higher return strategy that compounds over time.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/JasIpLf.png)\n\nLlama suggests Option 1) to focus on accumulating voting power as soon as possible, to support all possibilities mentioned above.\n\nThere are several more advanced strategies to which Aave could deploy assets to grow its strategic voting power over time which will be detailed in the RF strategies deployment proposal.\n\nIt is reasonable to think that, in time, AURA could be listed as collateral on Aave, generating aAURA revenue which could also be used to bolster this strategy. The compounding effects of using Aave’s revenue stream presents a unique opportunity to gain influence in how BAL and AURA incentives are distributed.\n\n# Implementation\n\nThis section has been up dated and uses data from early March 2023 which differs from older data mentioned earlier in this post.\n\nTo summarise, the below shows the current BAL and wETH to be swapped to B-80BAL-20WETH.\n\n|Asset|Amount|Price|Value|\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|BAL|309,102.07|$6.61|$2,043,756.21|\n|wETH|326.31|$1,565.79|$510,939.05|\n|B-80BAL-20wETH|||$2,554,695.26|\n\nThe amount of B-80BAL-20WETH received is estimated to be 152,617.94 units valued at\n\nLlama proposes the following methodology for obtaining the B-80BAL-20WETH holding:\n\n1. Redeem 326.31 awETH for wETH\n2. Approve 326.31 wETH on Cowswap\n3. Swap all 326.31 WETH to BAL. This routing minimises slippage.\n![|307x257](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/91M03SGqVM-CY3EA640gypvHrKToAMDGkze_9_55Ac9ZuOH3fB16bQXc50YjlxsgHbp0auh2pd7aLjNmdjzWevNnyB1zOurqwNRuO88x1VtW4MvifbzV8tVuIo3Ec8icnAPyZ4qj5rtrNUYsMiIfR_Q)\nThe BAL holdings are now 78,011.66 + 309,102.07 = 387,113.73 BAL\n4. Approve BAL on Cowswap\n5. Swap all BAL for B-80BAL-20WETH\n\n![|312x312](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/NyamWu2oOW0-UTQrXfcgD2kR4Z6J64pqWmD2kFrcZd_8Ay-MrXsGlGtIXnKSbhcHjzvfFFMtGTc_Hlpuel5Qp0j8GevSPNkqB9AkPN5LZhQLmAW-c8jYmESZPCkEI4QkSc8QaOhdFarIytRV6uq2QNA)\n\nAave is expected to receive 152,617.94 units of B-80BAL-20WETH. The B-80BAL-20WETH can be deposited into the voter escrow contract and locked to create a veBAL holding for Aave.\n\nAt the time of writing there are [14,133,907](https://dune.com/balancerlabs/veBAL) units of B-80BAL-20WETH in circulating supply backed by 28,685,996 BAL and 29,196 wETH valued at $235,329,238.4 or $16.65/unit of B-80BAL-20WETH.\n\n152,617.94*16.65 = $2,541,088.70\n$2,541,088.70 - $2,554,695.26 = -$13,606.56\n\nIn performing the above transactions, Aave incurs $13,606.56 (0.53%) of price impact (slippage) in converting 309,102.07 units of BAL and 326.31 units of wETH.\n\nFor comparison purposes, the Balancer veBAL tool generates 153,121.46 units of B-80BAL-20WETH for depositing 309,102 units of BAL and 323 units of wETH. Using this reference data, Aave would incur 0.33% of price impact. This is reflective of the estimated difference in B-80BAL-20WETH received between Cowswap and [Balancer’s veBAL Tool](https://balancer.tools/veBAL).\n\nThe number above are accurate at the time the post was drafted and shared for review. The final numbers to be used will be based upon the actual BAL and aBAL holding at the time.\n\n\n\n# Future Considerations\n\nThe above proposal focuses on whether Aave’s preference is for maximum governance influence or yield. Depending upon which direction Aave elects to proceed, there will be various other considerations and discussions that emerge.\n\nThose considerations are:\n\n* Determine how to use the veBAL and/or vlAURA holdings, GHO, staked aToken pools, pools include in the Safety Module upgrade\n* Implementation of meta-governance, via Snapshot, AIP, multi-sig etc…, [3,4]\n* Continual conversion of aBAL and awETH to veBAL, if Option 1) is voted\n\n# References\n\n[1] https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/115\n[2] https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/QmVqWgpRmoEvvhvXZFepmAgYU5ZK9XpSs39MExEUpiJZw3\n[3] https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/87/\n[4] https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-bal-interest-rate-curve-upgrade/10484/19\n[5] https://dune.com/queries/782195/1395498\n[6] https://app.warden.vote/dashboard/\n[7] https://etherscan.io/tx/0x94ac1109d58b02b5b74f10d92fb816a9cdc4b198fd455cc2bb2fdbb52ae84f9e\n[8] https://etherscan.io/token/0x616e8BfA43F920657B3497DBf40D6b1A02D4608d?a=0x5e5ea2048475854a5702f5b8468a51ba1296efcc\n[9] https://dev.balancer.fi/resources/deploy-pools-from-factory/creation/aavelinearpool\n[10] https://etherscan.io/token/0x272f97b7a56a387ae942350bbc7df5700f8a4576?a=0x464c71f6c2f760dda6093dcb91c24c39e5d6e18c\n[11] https://app.aura.finance/#/lock\n[12] https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0x3dd0843a028c86e0b760b1a76929d1c5ef93a2dd000200000000000000000249\n[13] https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0, [13].",

Llama has been looking at potential sources for CRV yield and governance influence. This proposal presents one high yield and one governance focused strategy for consideration:\n\nOption 1) veCRV - Lowest risk, governance and direct control CRV emissions\nOption 2) st-yCRV - High yield, no CRV emission influence and exit liquidity risk\nOption 3 ) sdCRV - High yield, proportional CRV emission influence and exit liquidity risk\n\nTo vote NAE is to deposit CRV in Aave v3 on the network it was earned. This represents the “do nothing” approach.\n\nA Snapshot vote presenting the three options will determine which options will be presented as an AIP. Each option has varying degrees of complexity to implement, with Option 1) being the most difficult in a decentralized way, but more closely aligned with Aave’s GHO and staked aToken direction.\n\n# Motivation\n\nAave currently holds 696k of CRV across Ethereum and Polygon networks. \n\nTo support Aave in choosing how best to manage the CRV holding, Llama presents three high-level strategies to choose between.\n\n## Option 1) veCRV - Lowest risk, governance and direct control CRV emissions\n\nOption 1) includes locking CRV, participating in Curve Finance governance, and voting to direct incentives to pools of Aave’s choosing. veCRV could be used to boost adoption of GHO, yield on staked aToken reserves, and yield on Protocol Owned Liquidity, to name a few potential use cases.\n\n### Pros\n\n* **Gauge weight power (Influence on CRV weekly emission)**\n\nBy locking it 4 years and relocking periodically to get the max voting power, the DAO would be able to redirect 0.0068 CRV/veCRV on the pools of its choice (Most likely directed to a GHO one) \n\nWith the current emission (reduced every year by 15%) the DAO would control 4,740 CRV of emission per week, representing $234.13K per year obtained without any additional expenses. \n\n* **Protocol fees (Profit sharing in 3CRV Stable pool)**\n\n50% of all protocol fees on Curve are directed to LPs, and the other 50% goes to veCRV holders. The current APR is 3,43% which is representative of the usual economic activity. With regular volumes, the APR is close to 2-5%, but weeks like USDC depeg, the APR was 15%. \nNo extra counterparty risk (No protocol on top of Curve) \n\nUnlike the two other options, the CRV will be locked on Curve directly from the Collector contract. This reduces the risks compared to using protocols on top of Curve which adds an additional layer of smart contract counterparty risks. \n\n* **Easy management of the veCRV position & votes** \n\nRe-locking the veCRV position can be made accessible, via adding a function on the Collector Contract. Llama can then create a bot which automatically calls the function and re-commits the veCRV holding. \nThe veCRV option only requires to lock CRV, no extra token required. \n\nWhen a gauge vote is submitted on Curve, there is no need to revote each week even if the position is increased, unless Aave decides to change the vote. \n\n* **Additional features from holding veCRV** \n\nGovernance Power to participate in the DAO decisions (On-Chain)\n\nveBoost which can be sold or utilized to maximize the rewards on the funds deposited: While we agree that the impact will be minimal at first, the veBoost will grow over time with the veCRV holdings, compared to both other solutions where it is lost. \n\n### Cons\n\n* **4 unlock period with frequent relock to keep the max voting power**\n\nThe goal of this strategy is to always relock to have the maximum voting power, and increase the position over time with the CRV earned. If Aave decides to stop this strategy at a later stage, the same amount of CRV that was locked will be available after 4 years. \n\nLlama can automate the relock periodically to avoid the decay. \n\n* **Complex participation in DAO decisions**\n\nGovernance participation can be challenging with the collector contract because of the important amount of DAO decisions voted, and there is no way to delegate the veCRV governance power. \n\n## Option 2) st-yCRV - High yield, no CRV emission influence and exit liquidity risk\n\nOption 2) focuses on yield, forgoes governance influence (participating in votes), and presents a higher-yielding investment strategy that, over time, will lead to Aave own more CRV relative to Option 1).\n\nThis option does not offer any governance influence which leads to an easier management. \n\nHowever, considering the recent events such as USDC de-peg and Euler hack which impacted many protocols, Llama believes that security should be prioritized and Aave  should proceed with the lowest risk proposal. \n\n### Pros\n\n* **Gauge weight power profits (Influence on CRV weekly emission)** \n\nWhile it’s not possible to directly vote with st-yCRV, Yearn utilizes the voting power to vote for the highest vote incentives on the market, then sells everything for CRV and compounds the strategy overtime. \n\n* **Boosted protocol fees profits (Profit sharing in 3CRV Stable pool)**\n\nYearn utilize its veCRV holdings to boost the distribution of the 3CRV (Currently 1.66x) \nAll 3CRV are collected, sold for CRV and compounded overtime.\n\n* **Temporary MegaBoost in CRV**\n\nAs mentioned earlier in this thread, Yearn decided to distribute 30k CRV/Week for a defined amount of time to maximize the yield. These CRV are also compounded in the strategy. Unless the decision is renewed, this should not be taken into account as the initial incentives should end soon. \n\n* **Easy management of the CRV position**\n\nRequires a deposit & stake to enter the strategy. The yield sources are collected in, or sold for CRV which are automatically compounded in st-yCRV. No further action is required by Aave post-staking yCRV.\n\nTotal current APR: 33%\n\n* **Transferable Asset (yCRV)** \n\nWhen CRV are deposited on Yearn, it is periodically relocked as veCRV, but the protocol mint yCRV at 1:1. These yCRV can be staked for st-yCRV and transferred or sold on the yCRV-CRV pool on Curve. \n\n### Cons\n\nNo direct governance influence** \n\nAll the gauge weight power and 3CRV are sold for CRV, and the governance power and veBoost are kept by Yearn. \n\nExtra counterparty risk (Yearn on top of Curve)** \n\nThis solution adds extra smart contract and counterparty risks as required to trust Yearn as a good manager of the strategy. \n\nHigh risk asset profile (Depeg risk)**\n\nThe yCRV is transferable, but the liquidity remains limited: $8.4M.\n \nWith the current Aave holdings and yCRV liquidity, it would be possible to exchange 680k yCRV with a rate of 0.9936:1. \n\nHowever, any selling pressure on the yCRV could lead to Aave incurring significant slippage when trying to exit the position. \n\n## Option 3) sdCRV - High yield, proportional CRV emission influence and exit liquidity risk\n\nsdCRV was proposed by the Stake DAO team in the comments, and presents as an hybrid solution between maximizing yield and governance influence. However, it requires veSDT holdings or boost delegation to Aave to be considered efficient compared to other solutions. \n\nUntil recently, the voting power on sdCRV was acquired progressively over a 30 day period. Stake DAO mentioned a parameter change related to asdcrv, but we couldn’t find any vote or public announcement about this update. However, even after this period, the voting power of 1 sdCRV was not equal to 1 veCRV if Aave does not lock SDT itself  or receive delegation from veSDT holders. \n\n## Pros\n\n* **Proportional gauge weight power (Influence on CRV weekly emission)**\n\nBy depositing 696k CRV on Stake, it would result in a voting power of 0.61 veCRV vote / sdCRV. With the current emission (reduced every year by 15%) the Aave would control 2,891 CRV of emission per week, representing $142.80K per year obtained without any additional expenses or veSDT boost holdings or delegation. \n\nTo avoid a SDT acquisition and reduced voting power, Marc Zeller from ACI is to delegate all his veSDT voting power (270k) to Aave for one year, as well as relocking & re-delegating every week enabling Aave to retain the provided boost. \n\nOther parties mentioned on the forum said that they consider to delegate, but no one other than ACI confirmed that they will delegate, relock & redelegate frequently or disclosed their holdings to track the delegation, so it’s not taken into account in this recap.  \n\nAccording to AaveChan engagement, the veSDT holding delegation would boost the voting power  to 1.14x for 1 year. \n\nWith the current emission (reduced every year by 15%) the DAO would control 5,403 CRV of emission per week, representing $266.9K per year obtained with 270k veSDT boost delegated. However, as soon as the delegation is over, the voting power will be back to 0.61x. \n\n* **Proportional protocol fees (Profit sharing in 3CRV Stable pool)**\n\nSame as on Curve, the 3CRV fees are distributed to sdCRV stakers. \n\n* **Transferable Asset (sdCRV)** \n\nWhen CRV are deposited on Stake DAO, it is periodically relocked as veCRV, but the protocol mint sdCRV at 1:1. These sdCRV can be staked for sdCRV-gauge, transferred or sold on the sdCRV-CRV pool on Curve. \n\nAdditionally, the Stake DAO team communicated that the votes now operate like veCRV.  Please note, Llama has not been able to publicly find this announcement beyond this forum thread.\n\n## Cons\n\n* **Extra counterparty risk (Stake on top of Curve)**\n\nThis solution adds extra smart contracts risks, similar to st-yCRV with additional counterparty risk through reliance on ACI and/or others to provide delegated veSDT support. This veSDT support requires weekly relock and redelegation to avoid impacting the boost.\n\nAs Aave’s CRV continues to grow in line with Aave revenue, additional veSDT delegation will be required to maintain the maximum boost. Llama does not question ACI’s dedication to Aave. After the initial committed 1 year period, Aave will receive reduced voting power if an alternative veSDT delegate is not found.\n\n* **High risk asset profile (Depeg risk)** \n\nThe sdCRV is transferable, but the liquidity remains limited: $3.8M.\n\n\nWith the current Aave holdings and liquidity, it would be possible to exchange 680k sdCRV with a rate of 0.9826:1.\n\n* **Management of the rewards**\n\nConsidering that Aave will vote for pools with no vote incentives have decided on the Curve pools, Aave would not earn part of the yield disclosed on the UI. \n\n\nMoreover, all rewards from vote incentives are sold for SDT and distributed. If Aave is to accumulate a CRV holding over time, the SDT tokens would need to be swapped to CRV. \n\n* **No veBoost (Kept by Stake DAO)** \n\nSame as Yearn, Stake DAO would keep the veBoost to maximize the yield on their strategies. \n\n## NAE - aCRV on v3 Liquidity Pools\n\nTo vote NAE involves Aave holding all CRV positions in the form of aCRV.\n\nAll CRV is to be migrated/deposited into Aave v3 on the respective network and held as aCRV. In order to achieve this, CRV must first be listed on Aave v3 Ethereum. The only smart contract exposure is the Aave protocol and this strategy best represents the “do nothing” approach versus either optimizing for governance influence with yield, Option 1), or outright CRV yield, Option 2).\n\n## Comments\n\nLlama suggests Option 1) to focus on accumulating active voting power and enabling Aave to determine how to manage the position.\n\nWe are particularly interested in creating an Aave aToken liquidity pool and explore what can be done to support GHO and staked aTokens when more details emerge around those upgrades. In our opinion, Option 2) has several significant unknowns which can impact the success of the strategy.\n\n# Next Steps\n\nThe proposal with the most YAE votes will be presented as an AIP  for voting. \n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",
