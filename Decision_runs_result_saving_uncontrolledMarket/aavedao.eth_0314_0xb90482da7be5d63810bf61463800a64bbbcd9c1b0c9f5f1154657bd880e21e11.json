        "body": "---\n\nTitle: [TEMP CHECK] Onboard RSR to Aave v3 \n\nAuthor: Reserve Protocol Core Team & ACI (Aave Chan Initiative)\n\nCreated: 2024-01-24\n\n---\n\n# Summary:\n\nThe Reserve Protocol Core Team proposes adding Reserve Rights (RSR) as an asset in AAVE V3 on Ethereum Mainnet. Reserve drives liquidity on AAVE lending markets through the underlying baskets of RToken collateral and demand for borrowing RSR will bring additional fees to AAVE. Reserve will also make available Curve ecosystem voting power to deepen GHO liquidity through a GHO-eUSD Curve pool.\n\n# Motivation:\n\nReserve is a free, permissionless platform on Ethereum mainnet to build, deploy and govern asset-backed currencies referred to as “RTokens.” RTokens are always 1:1 asset-backed, allowing for permissionless minting and redeeming on-chain by users without the need for any middlemen. The Reserve Protocol launched on Ethereum mainnet in Oct 2022, Base in Oct 2023, and completed its fifth audit in Feb 2023.\n\nRSR is the governance token for Reserve Protocol and can be staked on a particular RToken, where it has two roles:\n\n1. RToken Overcollateralization: Staked RSR receives a portion of the RToken collateral’s revenue in exchange for being the first capital-at-risk in the case of collateral default\n\n2. RToken Governance: Staked RSR proposes and votes on changes to the RToken’s configuration\n\nRSR contract has been live on ethereum for 1.5 years, has undergone audits by Solidified, and the dev team recently burned the multisig Pause Transfer functionality, making it immutable. RSR currently has a marketcap of $139m.\n\nThree of the RTokens already live on the protocol are High Yield USD (hyUSD) is a secure high yield savings dollar with up to 8% APY expected to outpace the rate of inflation in over 100 countries around the world. ETHPlus (ETH+) is a safety-first diversified ETH staking index with up to 4.5% APY. Electronic Dollar (eUSD) is a hyper-resilient stablecoin built to endure black swan events, recently proving itself during the run on Silicon Valley Bank.\n\n## Benefits of listing RSR:\n\nAn RSR lending market would fuel Reserve Protocol growth and TVL across Ethereum and Base networks. As the Reserve ecosystem expands, AAVE TVL grows because a portion of RToken collateral assets are held on AAVE lending markets for example, the largest RToken is currently eUSD ($17.7m TVL) which holds 50% of its collateral basket in USDC and USDT lending on AAVE.\n\nAdditionally, demand for RSR borrowing could create more fees for Aave.\n\nReserve Protocol is also open to providing seed liquidity for the asset.\n\n# Useful Links:\n\nProject: https://reserve.org/\nProtocol Documentation: Reserve Protocol Docs\nRSR Documentation: Reserve Protocol Docs | RSR\nGithub/Source Code: Reserve · GitHub\nRSR Contract (Ethereum): Reserve Rights: RSR Token | Address 0x320623b8E4fF03373931769A31Fc52A4E78B5d70 | Etherscan\nRSR Oracle: Chainlink: RSR / USD Price Feed | Address 0x759bBC1be8F90eE6457C44abc7d443842a976d02 | Etherscan\nDune Dashboard: https://dune.com/reserve-protocol/reserve-protocol-overview\nBlog: https://blog.reserve.org/\nAudits: Reserve has been audited 5 times, RSR was audited by Solidified\nCommunities: Discord 3K, Twitter 111K, 104 GitHub stars\nRSR Price: CoinGecko, CoinMarketCap\n\n\n# Disclaimer:\n\nThis proposal is powered by Skywards.

As productive assets, LSTs are high quality collateral to borrow against. Given their high correlation to ETH, LSTs are commonly used as collateral to borrow ETH and engage in yield leveraged staking, with several communities having built products that automate such strategies on top of Aave. The introduction of eMode only made such strategies more popular.\n\nosETH in particular is overcollateralized by design, providing in-built slashing protection and consequently an increased level of protection for the Aave protocol..\n\nAs StakeWise V3 provides solo stakers to ability to mint osETH against their own nodes, on-boarding osETH will benefit Aave, StakeWise, and the Ethereum ecosystem as a whole, and be an important step in the pursuit to diversify Ethereum staking and encourage staking from home.\n\nThe onboarding of osETH will consequently create increased osETH demand and increased revenues for both Aave and StakeWise protocols, whilst also bolstering the liquidity and peg stability of osETH.\n\n## Chain to be deployed/listed\n\nEthereum mainnet\n\n## Useful Links\n\n[Website](https://stakewise.io/)\n\n[V3 Litepaper](https://stakewise.io/stakewise-v3.pdf)\n\n[V3 Docs](https://docs-v3.stakewise.io/)\n\n[What is osETH?](https://stakewise.medium.com/what-is-oseth-a-deep-dive-into-the-overcollateralized-staked-ether-token-of-stakewise-v3-part-1-37d14e28282a)\n\n[Audits - Sigma Prime and Halborn](https://github.com/stakewise/v3-core/tree/main/audits)\n\n[Github Page](https://github.com/stakewise/v3-core)\n\nCommunities:  [Twitter](https://twitter.com/stakewise_io) / [Forum](https://forum.stakewise.io/)\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThe Aave-chan Initiative is not presenting this TEMP CHECK on behalf of any third party and is not compensated by Stakewise for creating this proposal.\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1.

        "body": "---\n\nTitle: [TEMP CHECK] Add rsETH to Aave V3 Ethereum \nAuthor: Kelp DAO & ACI (Aave Chan Initiative)\nDate: 2024-02-20\n\n---\n\n### **Summary**\n\n[Kelp DAO](https://www.kelpdao.xyz/) is seeking community support for adding its Liquid Restaking Token, rsETH, to Aave V3 on Ethereum. In addition, rsETH depositors into Aave will accumulate additional [Kelp miles](https://www.kelpdao.xyz/dashboard/) and EigenLayer points.\n\n### **Motivation**\n\n**KelpDAO** (https://www.kelpdao.xyz/restake/) is one of the largest liquid restaking protocol built on top of the Eigen Layer. Restakers on Kelp get access to multiple benefits like restaking rewards, staking rewards and DeFi yields.\n\n**Latest stats**:\n\n- USD 470 Mn+ (~168k Eth) TVL\n- 18K restakers onboarded\n- Accepts ETHx, stETH and sfrxETH and Native ETH as collateral\n- Live across mainnet and L2s such as Arbitrum and Polygon zkEVM\n\nKelpDAO has undergone multiple security audits by top tier audit firms including Sigma Prime, Code4rena. More about KelpDAO’s security here: [Kelp DAO Audit reports](https://kelp.gitbook.io/kelp/audits).\n\nThe motivation for this proposal is to introduce a new asset class LRT (Liquid restaking tokens) to Aave and add to the diversity of LST/ LRT category.\n\n**Restaking Innovation**\n\nKelpDAO’s innovation in the restaking ecosystem has been focused on bringing about the following benefits to users and services-\n\n- Restakers\n    - Liqudity for restaked assets (stETH, ETHx, sfrxETH and Native ETH)\n    - Access to additional staking rewards\n    - Participate in DeFi using rsETH\n- AVSs\n    - Bootstrap economic security\n    - Lowered incentive spends\n- Operators\n    - Higher revenue earning potential\n    - Service onboarding and community support\n    - Marketing for node delegation\n\n### Specification\n\nDetailed explanation on Kelp’s technical architecture - [Technical Architecture - Kelp](https://kelp.gitbook.io/kelp/technical-architecture)\n\nKelpDAO will have its own token $Kelp that will be the main governance token of Kelp protocol. Kelp token holders will be able to participate in governance related matters including Whitelisting/ delisting of Assets, Node operators, AVS’, setting and updating fees for Kelp protocol.\n\nKelp’s on-chain stats can be viewed on [Dune](https://dune.com/kelp_dao/dashboard-catalogue).\n\n**Liquidity Pools for rsETH**\n\nFollowing are liquidity stats for rsETH:\n\n- rsETH has >12 Mn USD liquidity across several DEXs on mainnet including\n    - [Balancer](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0x7761b6e0daa04e70637d81f1da7d186c205c2ade00000000000000000000065d) - $4 Mn\n    - [Curve](https://curve.fi/#/ethereum/pools/factory-stable-ng-67/deposit) - $4 Mn\n    - [Uniswap V3](https://info.uniswap.org/#/pools/0x64939a882c7d1b096241678b7a3a57ed19445485) - $3.2 Mn\n    - [Maverick](https://app.mav.xyz/boosted-positions/0x1b06f8fc94b95b6a8075aa1dcf12e69c70144c52?chain=1) - $0.9 Mn\n- $3.5 Mn average daily trading volume (Last 7 days on 17th Feb)\n\n**rsETH exchange rate mechanism:**\n\nExchange rate is calculated basis the formula:\n\nrseth / eth = [(asset amount in protocol * asset price in ETH)rsETH total supply]\n\nrsEth relies on multiple contract exchange rates for:\n\n1. stEth: As this is a rebasing token, the balance of stETH changes over time and the asset price is taken as 1stETH = 1 ETH.\n\n2. ETHx: Asset price is taken from getExchangeRate( ) method in -  https://etherscan.io/address/0xcf5EA1b38380f6aF39068375516Daf40Ed70D299#readProxyContract\n\n3. Sfrxeth: Asset price is taken from pricePerShare( ) method in -  https://etherscan.io/token/0xac3e018457b222d93114458476f3e3416abbe38f\n\n**Withdrawals and risks**\n\nAs of today, the only way to exit rsETH is via DEXs. KelpDAO is going to enable withdrawals by mid-March 2024 after which users can withdraw Eth or any LSTs via KelpDAO dapp.\n\n### Proof of Liquidity and Deposit Commitments:\n\nAnyone who deposits rsETH into Aave will accumulate additional [Kelp miles](https://www.kelpdao.xyz/dashboard/) and EigenLayer points.\n\n### **Useful Links:**\n\n- [KelpDAO’s Dapp](https://www.kelpdao.xyz/)\n- Contract Address: [0xA1290d69c65A6Fe4DF752f95823fae25cB99e5A7](https://etherscan.io/token/0xA1290d69c65A6Fe4DF752f95823fae25cB99e5A7)\n- [Github Docs](https://kelp.gitbook.io/kelp)\n\n### Disclaimer:\n\nThis proposal is powered by Skywards. The Aave Chan Initiative is not directly affiliated with Kelp DAO and did not receive compensation for creation this proposal. \n\n### Next Steps\n\n1. If consensus is reached on this [TEMP CHECK], escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n2. If the Snapshot outcome is YAE, this proposal will be escalated to ARFC stage\n3. Publication of a standard ARFC, collect community & service providers feedback before escalating proposal to ARFC snapshot stage\n4. If the ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, publish an AIP vote for final confirmation and enforcement of the proposal\n\n### Copyright:\n\nCopyright and related rights waived under [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)",

        "body": "---\n\nTitle: [TEMP CHECK] Onboarding weETH to Aave V3 Ethereum \nAuthor: Ether.fi  & ACI (Aave Chan Initiative)\nDate: 2024-02-05\n\n---\n### **Summary**\n\n[ether.fi](http://ether.fi/) is seeking community support for adding its Liquid Restaking Token (weETH) to Aave V3 Ethereum. In addition, anyone who deposits weETH into Aave will accumulate [ether.fi](http://ether.fi/) and EigenLayer points to be used for future incentives.\n\n### **Motivation**\n\nThis move is intended to improve asset diversity on Aave and increase liquidity in the ecosystem.\n\n[ether.fi](http://ether.fi) is the first decentralized, non-custodial delegated staking protocol with an LRT (eETH). One of the distinguishing characteristics of [ether.fi](http://ether.fi) is that stakers control their keys. Those who work on the protocol strive for the following:\n\n1. Decentralization is the primary objective. [ether.fi](http://ether.fi) will never compromise on the non-custodial and decentralized nature of the protocol. Stakers must maintain control of their ETH.\n2. The [ether.fi](http://ether.fi) protocol is a real business with a sustainable revenue model. The team is in this for the long haul. No ponzinomics f*ckery.\n3. [ether.fi](http://ether.fi) will do the right thing for the Ethereum community, always. If and when the team messes up, [ether.fi](http://ether.fi) will own it and course correct quickly.\n\n**Staking Primitives**\n\n[ether.fi](http://ether.fi) is working to advance innovation in the space by incorporating staking primitives that reward users and uphold values of decentralization. Distributed Validator Technology (DVT) is a core feature of Operation Solo Staker, an initiative that [ether.fi](http://ether.fi) helped launch in April 2023. Along with Obol Labs, dappnode and Avado, [ether.fi](http://ether.fi) assisted with the first instance of a solo staker cluster using DVT on Mainnet in August 2023. More recently, [ether.fi](http://ether.fi) became the first LSP to natively restake on EigenLayer.\n\n**Tokenomics & Governance**\n\neETH is an LRT that allows users to stake their ETH, accrue staking rewards, and receive additional rewards through native restaking on EigenLayer. As of February 3rd, approximately 290,310 ETH ($670M) in TVL has been deposited into the [ether.fi](http://ether.fi) protocol, and XX has been natively restaked in EigenLayer.\n\nUsers are given eETH on a 1:1 basis with a minimum deposit of 0.001 ETH. As mentioned above, [ether.fi](http://ether.fi) is also the first LSP to natively restake on EigenLayer — a move that helps improve network efficiency and provides stakers with additional rewards for their network contributions. [ether.fi](http://ether.fi) has also launched a series of partnerships with DeFi protocols to incentivize users and drive liquidity (weETH) to various platforms.\n\nThe goal of [ether.fi](http://ether.fi) is to make all aspects of the protocol 100% open sourced and ossify the smart contracts to prevent them from being upgraded. The protocol will eventually be governed by a DAO, and those who work on [ether.fi](http://ether.fi) have also committed to self-limiting the amount of ETH staked on the protocol to 25% of the total amount of ETH staked on the Beacon Chain.\n\n**Points System**\n\n[Ether.fi](http://Ether.fi) has amassed a following by offering users points based on their activity. Those who stake with [ether.fi](http://ether.fi) have the opportunity to earn both [ether.fi](http://ether.fi) and EigenLayer points that will be used for future incentives.\n\n**On-chain Metrics**\n\n* As of February 3rd, 2024\n* Total Value Locked (TVL): $669,826,357 (290,310.46 ETH)\n* 24-hr trading volume (TV): $4,051,395\n* Max daily deposit: 24,489 ETH (January 25, 2024)\n* Unique eETH holders: 49,858\n* Daily max weETH pools TV: Pendle ($10.33m), Curve ($811.70k), Uniswap ($1.88m), Balancer ($239.66k), Maverick ($4.18m) (January 29, 2024)\n\nYou can view additional [ether.fi](http://ether.fi) stats on [Dune](https://dune.com/ether_fi/etherfi).\n\n**Risk mitigation**\n\n[ether.fi](http://ether.fi)’s LRT eETH is 100% redeemable. Users who deposit ETH into the protocol can withdraw their stake at any time. The holdings are publicly auditable on-chain and the protocol retains healthy reserves to offset any losses.\n\n### Specification\n\n[Ether.fi site](https://www.ether.fi/)\n\nContract Address: [0x35fa164735182de50811e8e2e824cfb9b6118ac2](https://etherscan.io/token/0xcd5fe23c85820f7b72d0926fc9b05b43e359b7ee)\n\n### **Useful Links:**\n\n### Disclaimer:\n\nThis proposal is powered by Skywards. The Aave Chan Initiative is not directly affiliated with [Ether.fi](http://Ether.fi) and did not receive compensation for creation this proposal.\n\nThe co-author is a team member [Ether.fi](http://Ether.fi)\n\n### Next Steps\n\n1. If consensus is reached on this [TEMP CHECK], escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n2. If the Snapshot outcome is YAE, this proposal will be escalated to ARFC stage\n3. Publication of a standard ARFC, collect community & service providers feedback before escalating proposal to ARFC snapshot stage\n4.

        "body": "---\n\nTitle: [TEMP CHECK] Integrate Oval for the BAL & SNX Ethereum V3 Markets \nAuthor: UMA\nDate: 2024-01-31\n\n---\n\n### Summary\n\nThis proposal seeks to integrate Oval developed by UMA into the BAL and SNX Ethereum V3 markets. This **pilot program** will enable Aave DAO to capture MEV associated with oracle updates from liquidations that occur in the BAL & SNX markets. This proposal is purposefully small in its initial scope, targeting only two isolated pools (BAL & SNX), to allow Aave to experiment with MEV capture with a bounded, low-risk pilot.\n\n### Motivation\n\nAave incentivizes third parties to liquidate Aave debt positions that have become distressed through a liquidation bonus. These liquidations generate enough profit that searchers compete to send their liquidating transactions immediately after the Chainlink price feed update. The MEV from Aave liquidations has benefitted searchers, block builders and validators, but not Aave protocol, which could have generated up to **$62.2MM** (Jan 2021 to Jan 2024) via Oval.\n\nOval allows Aave to capture the majority of this MEV as revenue. Oval is a MEV capture tool for [Oracle Extractable Value](https://docs.oval.xyz/oval-overview/problem) built on Chainlink Data Feeds and Flashbot’s [MEV-Share](https://docs.flashbots.net/flashbots-protect/mev-share) infrastructure. Oval requires no smart contract code changes to integrate.\n\n### Specification\nOval enables OEV capture by wrapping Chainlink price updates as they are pushed onchain so that OEV cannot be extracted without the consent of the protocol.\n\nWith Oval, when searchers perform a liquidation on Aave an order flow auction is triggered using Flashbots’ MEV Share—a trusted tool that allows MEV searchers to compete for MEV extraction offchain.\n\nTo extract the OEV created by an update, searchers must submit a winning bid, most of which is paid to the protocol as revenue. The winner of the auction gets the right to backrun the oracle update transaction—performing the liquidation by adding their transaction to the block immediately after the price update.\n\nIf no bid is received by the end of the auction window, the Chainlink price is automatically released and Aave liquidations function as normal.\n\nDeploying Oval requires two simple steps:\n\n- Deploy Aave’s own instance of the Oval smart contracts for the BAL and SNX markets (UMA is happy to assist with this).\n- Update the BAL and SNX market’s oracle address from the Chainlink price feed to the Oval smart contract that points to the same Chainlink price feed.\nThese steps are further detailed in our docs 4. UMA is committed to providing ongoing support to ensure a successful implementation of Oval.\n\n### Useful Links\n\n- [Aave Liquidations](https://docs.aave.com/faq/liquidations)\n- [Oval documentation](https://docs.oval.xyz/)\n- [Flashbots MEV-Share](https://docs.flashbots.net/flashbots-protect/mev-share)\n- [Aave OEV Dashboard](https://dune.com/risk_labs/aave-oev-via-liquidation-bonuses)\n- [Oval Launch Post](https://medium.com/uma-project/announcing-oval-earn-protocol-revenue-by-capturing-oracle-mev-877192c51fe2)\n\n### Disclaimer\n\nThis proposal is powered by Skywards. The Aave Chan Initiative is not directly affiliated with UMA Team and did not receive compensation for creation this proposal.\n\n### Next Steps\n\n1. If consensus is reached on this [TEMP CHECK], escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n2. If the Snapshot outcome is YAE, this proposal will be escalated to ARFC stage\n3. Publication of a standard ARFC, collect community & service providers feedback before escalating proposal to ARFC snapshot stage\n4. If the ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, publish an AIP vote for final confirmation and enforcement of the proposal\n\n### Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",
