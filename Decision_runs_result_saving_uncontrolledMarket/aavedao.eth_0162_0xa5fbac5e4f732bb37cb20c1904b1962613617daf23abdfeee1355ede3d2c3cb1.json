CDCETH is an ERC-20 token issued on both Ethereum and the Cronos Chain that represents the underlying staked ETH on the [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) platform.\n\n### Motivation\n\n[Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) was founded in 2016 with the vision of making cryptocurrency in every wallet. As of June 2024, [Crypto.com (http://crypto.com/) has more than 100 million users worldwide and is the industry leader in regulatory compliance, security, and privacy.\n\n[Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) launched its on-chain staking product on its Main App and Exchange platform, with Ethereum as one of the most staked assets on the platform. \n\nTo enhance the liquidity and capital efficiency of staked ETH, [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) introduced a Liquid Staking Token (LST) - [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) Staked ETH (CDCETH) in November 2023 and reached $100M+ TVL (Defillama page here).\n\nCurrently, CDCETH’s on-chain liquidity on Ethereum is concentrated in the CDCETH/ETH pair on Curve (here) and Uniswap (here), with plans to launch a pool on Balancer next and incentivize to grow liquidity across these venues. \n\nOther liquidity venues can be found on the DeFi protocols on the Cronos chain and the order book on the [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) Exchange platform, with support from multiple market makers. \n\nThe liquidity on the Cronos side can be bridged to Ethereum through the [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) platform.\n\nIntegrating CDCETH as a collateral asset on Aave V3 serves a meaningful demand from CDCETH users on the [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) platform to utilize the LST as collateral to borrow on Aave. The platform aims to drive wide adoption of CDCETH on Aave V3 as collateral for borrowing by various promotional activities and integration with its product lines, such as social media posts when CDCETH is successfully onboarded.\n\nConfidential banners/listings on the [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) non-custodial wallet and banners within the Main App platform to direct CDCETH holders to use Aave via the non-custodial wallet.\nOnboarding CDCETH on Aave will create an entry point for a large number of CDCETH users and [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) users to make good use of the asset on Aave and also greatly improve CDCETH’s utility as a LST, resulting in a positive feedback loop for CDCETH & Aave adoption & increased revenues for both parties.\n\n### Proof of Liquidity (POL) and Deposit Commitments\n\n [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) is committed to providing initial supply-side liquidity of up to $5M CDCETH and liquidity mining programs of $100K in CDCETH over 3 months as a start.\n\nIntegration of CDCETH pool on Aave V3 with [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/)’s non-custodial wallet and Main App will be added to the pipeline once the pool is live, providing the gateway to over 100M global users on the platform.\n\n### Specification\n\nContract address: 0xfe18aE03741a5b84e39C295Ac9C856eD7991C38e\nRate Provider contract for current exchange rate:\n0xfe18aE03741a5b84e39C295Ac9C856eD7991C38e (12. exchangeRate)\n\nRisk Parameters will be provided at ARFC stage by Risk Service Providers.\n\n### Audits & Relevant links\n\nAudit: https://crypto.com/document/blocksec_securityaudit2024\n Issuer: [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/)\nWhitepaper: CDCETH\nDeFillama: https://defillama.com/protocol/crypto.com-staked-eth\nCoingecko: https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/crypto-com-staked-eth\n[Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) Staking page: https://crypto.com/staking\n[Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) Liquid Staking Q&A page: https://help.crypto.com/en/articles/8398277-liquid-staking\n\nCommunity:\nTwitter/X: https://twitter.com/cryptocom\nTelegram: [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/)\nNews on Telegram: [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/)\nDiscord: [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/)\n\n### Disclaimer\n\nThe ACI is not directly affiliated with [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) and did not receive compensation for the creation of this proposal.

        "body": "---\n\nTitle: [TEMP CHECK] Onboard RSR to Aave v3 \n\nAuthor: Reserve Protocol Core Team & ACI (Aave Chan Initiative)\n\nCreated: 2024-01-24\n\n---\n\n# Summary:\n\nThe Reserve Protocol Core Team proposes adding Reserve Rights (RSR) as an asset in AAVE V3 on Ethereum Mainnet. Reserve drives liquidity on AAVE lending markets through the underlying baskets of RToken collateral and demand for borrowing RSR will bring additional fees to AAVE. Reserve will also make available Curve ecosystem voting power to deepen GHO liquidity through a GHO-eUSD Curve pool.\n\n# Motivation:\n\nReserve is a free, permissionless platform on Ethereum mainnet to build, deploy and govern asset-backed currencies referred to as “RTokens.” RTokens are always 1:1 asset-backed, allowing for permissionless minting and redeeming on-chain by users without the need for any middlemen. The Reserve Protocol launched on Ethereum mainnet in Oct 2022, Base in Oct 2023, and completed its fifth audit in Feb 2023.\n\nRSR is the governance token for Reserve Protocol and can be staked on a particular RToken, where it has two roles:\n\n1. RToken Overcollateralization: Staked RSR receives a portion of the RToken collateral’s revenue in exchange for being the first capital-at-risk in the case of collateral default\n\n2. RToken Governance: Staked RSR proposes and votes on changes to the RToken’s configuration\n\nRSR contract has been live on ethereum for 1.5 years, has undergone audits by Solidified, and the dev team recently burned the multisig Pause Transfer functionality, making it immutable. RSR currently has a marketcap of $139m.\n\nThree of the RTokens already live on the protocol are High Yield USD (hyUSD) is a secure high yield savings dollar with up to 8% APY expected to outpace the rate of inflation in over 100 countries around the world. ETHPlus (ETH+) is a safety-first diversified ETH staking index with up to 4.5% APY. Electronic Dollar (eUSD) is a hyper-resilient stablecoin built to endure black swan events, recently proving itself during the run on Silicon Valley Bank.\n\n## Benefits of listing RSR:\n\nAn RSR lending market would fuel Reserve Protocol growth and TVL across Ethereum and Base networks. As the Reserve ecosystem expands, AAVE TVL grows because a portion of RToken collateral assets are held on AAVE lending markets for example, the largest RToken is currently eUSD ($17.7m TVL) which holds 50% of its collateral basket in USDC and USDT lending on AAVE.\n\nAdditionally, demand for RSR borrowing could create more fees for Aave.\n\nReserve Protocol is also open to providing seed liquidity for the asset.\n\n# Useful Links:\n\nProject: https://reserve.org/\nProtocol Documentation: Reserve Protocol Docs\nRSR Documentation: Reserve Protocol Docs | RSR\nGithub/Source Code: Reserve · GitHub\nRSR Contract (Ethereum): Reserve Rights: RSR Token | Address 0x320623b8E4fF03373931769A31Fc52A4E78B5d70 | Etherscan\nRSR Oracle: Chainlink: RSR / USD Price Feed | Address 0x759bBC1be8F90eE6457C44abc7d443842a976d02 | Etherscan\nDune Dashboard: https://dune.com/reserve-protocol/reserve-protocol-overview\nBlog: https://blog.reserve.org/\nAudits: Reserve has been audited 5 times, RSR was audited by Solidified\nCommunities: Discord 3K, Twitter 111K, 104 GitHub stars\nRSR Price: CoinGecko, CoinMarketCap\n\n\n# Disclaimer:\n\nThis proposal is powered by Skywards.

        "body": "---\n### [TEMP CHECK] Onboard osGNO to Aave v3 Gnosis\n### Author: ACI\n###  Date: 2024-07-29\n---\n\n### **Summary**\n\nThis proposal aims to Onboard osGNO, the Liquid Staking Token (LST) of StakeWise V3 into the GnosisMarket. By integrating osGNO, Aave users will be provided with additional liquidity and yield opportunities while supporting the growth of LSTs within the DeFi ecosystem on Gnosis Chain.\n\n### **Motivation**\n\nGNO is used for governance within the GnosisDAO and acts as a staking token for Gnosis Chain. \n\nosGNO is a Liquid Staking Token (LST) representing GNO staked in StakeWise V3 on Gnosis Chain. It can be minted from any Vault created in StakeWise on Gnosis in order to make a user’s stake liquid. Users have the option of staking in one of the Vaults in the Marketplace to mint osGNO, creating their own Vault as a solo staker and minting osGNO from there, or purchasing osGNO directly on a DEX.\n\nCreating Vaults and staking in them is a permissionless process on StakeWise, and so is access to osGNO. For additional protection, every minted osGNO has an excess backing of staked tokens, provided by the minters themselves.  \n\nosGNO increases in value relative to GNO as staking rewards accrue, it can be redeemed for the underlying GNO within Vaults using the redemption mechanism detailed [here](https://docs.stakewise.io/protocol-overview-in-depth/oseth#redemption-mechanism). If there are not sufficient liquid reserves available for redemption, there may be delays in unstaking and redeeming the osGNO for underlying GNO which could result in a temporary depeg.\n\nosETH was recently added as collateral on Aave v3 Ethereum and has seen good adoption. In order to improve Aave’s marketshare on Gnosis Cchain, and support the Gnosis and StakeWise ecosystems it is proposed to also Onboard osGNO into Gnosis Market.\n\n### **Proof of Liquidity and Deposit Commitments**\n\nPotential POL and Deposit Commitments will be discussed at ARFC stage.\n\n### **Specification**\n\nContract address: 0xF490c80aAE5f2616d3e3BDa2483E30C4CB21d1A0\n\nRisk Parameters will be provided at ARFC Stage by Risk Service Providers.\n\n### **Useful Links:**\n\nosGNO announcement post: https://stakewise.medium.com/announcing-the-launch-of-stakewise-v3-on-gnosis-chain-0231285bd8e3\n\nosGNO Vaults: https://app.stakewise.io/vaults\n\n### **Disclaimer:**\n\nThis proposal is powered by Skywards. ACI is not directly affiliated with StakeWise and did not receive compensation for creation this proposal.\n\nACI and some ACI team members are holders of GNO.\n\n### **Next Steps**\n\n1. If consensus is reached on this [TEMP CHECK], escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n2. If the Snapshot outcome is YAE, this proposal will be escalated to ARFC stage\n3. Publication of a standard ARFC, collect community & service providers feedback before escalating proposal to ARFC snapshot stage\n4. If the ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, publish an AIP vote for final confirmation and enforcement of the proposal\n\n### **Copyright:**\n\nCopyright and related rights waived under [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)",

        "body": "## Title: [ARFC] Onboard STONE to Aave V3 on Scroll\n\n## Author: ACI\n\n## Date: 2024-09-02\n\n---\n\n### **Summary**\n\nStakeStone is the protocol issuing STONE, the liquid ETH, with over 150k users. Currently, StakeStone is seeking support to onboard STONE to Aave V3 on Scroll and is launching a series of initiatives to boost liquidity and Aave adoption.\n\n### **Motivation/Background**\n\nSTONE is an ERC-20 rebalancing token that generates risk-free rewards for ETH based on blue-chip underlying assets like Lido, EigenLayer, and Symbiotic in a decentralized manner through our OPAP governance mechanism. StakeStone currently has $350 million worth of STONE deployed on Scroll. To ensure that STONE has robust liquidity, in addition to the STONE-ETH DEX liquidity on Scroll, STONE also has PMM powered cross-chain liquidity. Users can perform cross-chain redemption and receive ETH on the Ethereum mainnet within 40 seconds, with optimized pricing.\n\nSTONE aims to become the liquid ETH, covering users’ opportunity costs while creating more use cases for STONE holders. Thanks to its architecture supporting multiple underlying assets, STONE can maintain market adaptability and stability over the long term, allowing users and the protocol to avoid the need to mint or integrate a new asset.\n\n**Benefits of listing STONE token:**\n\nSTONE is collaborating with Scroll to build a DeFi ecosystem. STONE works closely with various protocols to support the ecosystem and facilitate their go-to-market strategies. Currently, STONE is the largest asset category on Scroll, accounting for over 30% of the total TVL across the chain, with a high utilization rate (close to 90%). The StakeStone team is dedicated to offering services to protocols that support STONE while fostering collaboration for shared prosperity, which is reflected in the high utilization of STONE across various DeFi use cases.\n\n**Market Impact:**\n\nAs of today, over 180,000 ETH have been staked in StakeStone, with a historical high of 340,000 ETH. StakeStone has also successfully processed nearly 1 billion dollars in inflows and outflows. Meanwhile, STONE has a wide user base, and all users are very active on-chain. We hope that this active community can bring more liquidity and activity to AAVE.\n\n### **Chain to be deployed/listed:**\n\nScroll chain. Scroll grew to become the top zk rollup in terms of TVL and shows continued strength in community and volume.\n\n### **Proof of Liquidity (POL) and Deposit Commitments**\n\nStakeStone has collaborations with external parties to bootstrap liquidity for a more robust and diverse liquidity environment at AAVE. Large liquidity providers are highly interested in using STONE in AAVE and further boosting DEX liquidity for STONE. StakeStone will also have its own liquidity mining incentive campaign for STONE in AAVE.\n\nTo incentivize the use of STONE in AAVE, StakeStone will provide boosted STONE points for STONE suppliers and is planning a yield-boost campaign specifically designed to maximize engagement.\n\nAmong our active liquidity providers, we have gathered strong interest in using STONE for lending and borrowing. The team will actively engage with liquidity providers to achieve a supply of at least 5,000 STONE, gradually increasing it over time as risk parameters are adjusted.\n\n### Specification\n\nFollowing analysis from Chaos Labs, the recommend the following parameter settings are:\n\n| **Parameter** | **Value** |\n| --- | --- |\n| Isolation Mode | No |\n| Borrowable | Yes |\n| Collateral Enabled | Yes |\n| Supply Cap | 4,800 |\n| Borrow Cap | 480 |\n| Debt Ceiling | - |\n| LTV | 72.5% |\n| LT | 75% |\n| Liquidation Bonus | 7.5% |\n| Liquidation Protocol Fee | 10.00% |\n| Variable Base | 0.00% |\n| Variable Slope1 | 7.00% |\n| Variable Slope2 | 300.00% |\n| Uoptimal | 45.00% |\n| Reserve Factor | 15.00% |\n| Stable Borrowing | Disabled |\n| Flashloanable | Yes |\n| Siloed Borrowing | No |\n| Borrowable in Isolation | No |\n| E-Mode Category | N/A |\n\n### Other relevant information\n\nSTONE has undergone multiple rounds of audits conducted by firms such as Quantstamp, Slowmist, Veridise, and Secure3, and closely collaborates with security organizations like Cobo and Coincover.\n\n### **Useful Links**\n\n[Dune Analytics for data about STONE](https://dune.com/HolyMoon/stakestone)\n\n[Security audits](https://docs.stakestone.io/stakestone/additionals/audits-and-security)\n\n[Governance votes about asset](https://app.stakestone.io/u/portfolio-allocation/vote/vote-list)\n\n[OPAP proposal example](https://x.com/Stake_Stone/status/1772286551340286261)\n\n### **Disclaimer**\n\nThis proposal is powered by Skywards.

        "body": "Title: [ARFC] Onboard fdUSD to Aave v3 on BSC \n\nAuthor: ACI (Aave Chan Initiative)\n\nDate: 2024-01-23\n\n# Summary\n\nThe proposal aims to onboard fdUSD, a fiat-backed stablecoin, to the Aave v3 protocol on the BNB Chain (BSC).\n\n## **Motivation**\n\nfdUSD is a dollar-pegged stablecoin that provides stability and value preservation for users on the BNB Chain. It is issued by FD121 Ltd. (First Digital Labs), a subsidiary of First Digital Group that is incorporated in Hong Kong.\n\nAs part of the approved [deployment on BSC](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-aave-v3-deployment-on-bnb-chain/12609), fdUSD will be a key asset for supply liquidity and borrow demand. As this is a net-new asset for Aave, we propose this ARFC to confirm community approval to add fdUSD as an asset for the launch of the BSC deployment of Aave. The proposal seeks to leverage the strong demand for stablecoins and the growing popularity of the BSC ecosystem to provide users with enhanced liquidity options.\n\n**Benefits of listing fdUSD:**\n\n- Enhanced liquidity options for Aave users on the BSC deployment\n- Increased utility for fdUSD as it becomes available for lending and borrowing\n- Strengthened collaboration between Aave and the BSC ecosystem, fostering growth and innovation\n- Aave’s BSC deployment will be integrated with Binance’s web3 wallet, making easy access for Binance users to deposit fdUSD in Aave through the Earn program.\n\n**Market Impact:**\n\nListing fdUSD contributes to the overall growth of Aave by expanding the range of assets available for lending and borrowing on the BSC pool.\n\nAs a main asset for use in Binance launch pools, we expect there to be good borrow demand for this asset.\n\n**Chains to be deployed/listed:** \n\nThe intention is to list fdUSD on the Aave’s upcoming BNB Chain deployment.\n\n**Proof of Liquidity (POL) and Deposit Commitments:**\n\n- Collaborations with external parties are in place to bootstrap liquidity and contribute to a robust and diverse liquidity environment for fdUSD. BNB chain partners have committed to providing an initial supply side liquidity of up to 5m fdUSD.\n- Plans for implementing liquidity mining programs tailored to Aave’s BSC deployment are under consideration.\n\n## Specification\n\nTicker: fdUSD\n\nContract Adress: [0xc5f0f7b66764f6ec8c8dff7ba683102295e16409](https://bscscan.com/address/0xc5f0f7b66764f6ec8c8dff7ba683102295e16409)\n\nChainlink Oracle: [0x390180e80058a8499930f0c13963ad3e0d86bfc9](https://bscscan.com/address/0x390180e80058a8499930f0c13963ad3e0d86bfc9)\n\nBased on Risk Service providers, the following Risk Parameters are proposed:\n\n|Risk Parameter | FDUSD|\n|--- | ---|\n|Isolation Mode | NO|\n|Enable Borrow | YES|\n|Borrowable in Isolation | YES|\n|Enable Collateral | YES|\n|Emode Category | NO|\n|Loan To Value | 70%|\n|Liquidation Threshold | 75%|\n|Liquidation Bonus | 5.00%|\n|Reserve Factor | 20.00%|\n|Liquidation Protocol Fee | 10.00%|\n|Borrow Cap | 7,500,000|\n|Supply Cap | 8,000,000|\n|Debt Ceiling | N/A|\n|Stable Borrowing | NO|\n|uOptimal | 90%|\n|Base | 0%|\n|Slope1 | 6%|\n|Slope2 | 75%|\n\n## **Useful Links**\n\n- [fdUSD](https://firstdigitallabs.com/) - First Digital Labs website.\n- [fdUSD Whitepaper](https://firstdigitallabs.com/workspace/uploads/FDUSD-Whitepaper-25216064ca0cc8.pdf)\n- TEMP CHECK https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-onboard-fdusd-to-aave-v3-on-bsc/16131\n- Snapshot https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0xd5ffa15a59b5b29cd4ba2dc4439f1cfb57673faa4d8644120a02dbc5b47505d5\n\n## **Disclaimer**\n\nACI worked with relevant partners in the BNB Chain ecosystem to craft this proposal. ACI holds no conflict of interest or relationship with the fdUSD protocol, and no compensation has been received for publishing this proposal.\n\n## **Next Steps**\n\n1. If consensus on ARFC stage is reached and risk service providers provide feedback on risk parameters, escalate to ARFC snapshot stage.\n2. If ARFC snapshot stage outcome is YAE, escalate to AIP stage\n\n## Copyright:\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

Historical similar proposals onboarding stablecoins to Aave V3 also passed with leading YAE votes. While market and TVL impacts showed negative price and TVL changes, these do not diminish the strategic value of expanding stablecoin options. Forum sentiment is mixed but leans positive, with supporters highlighting AUSD's institutional backing and liquidity, while detractors raise concerns about audit transparency and legal clarity.",
