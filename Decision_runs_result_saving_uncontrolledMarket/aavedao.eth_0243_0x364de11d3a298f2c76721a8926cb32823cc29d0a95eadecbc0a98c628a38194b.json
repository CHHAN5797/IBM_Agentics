This will enable the ACI to enact incentive programs funded by SNX ecosystem partners for all sUSD markets, promoting growth and expanding the user base of Aave on Optimism.\n\n# Motivation\n\nThe Aave Chan Initiative has been in discussion with various parties that have a desire to actively contribute to the growth and development of Aave V3 on Optimism. In order to facilitate emissions by various stakeholders, ACI proposes becoming the emissions manager for sUSD on Optimism. Emission incentives will be sent to ACI multisig and distributed as agreed on with partners. \n\nBy setting the multisig as the emission manager for the sUSD token, the ACI will be able to directly manage incentive programs that can attract more users to the protocol and stimulate activity. This aligns with the broader goals of the Aave community to foster active and engaged markets on Optimism.\n\n# Specification\n\nThe ACI multisig address OP:0xac140648435d03f784879cd789130F22Ef588Fcd will be set as Emissions manager.\n\nThe call to the setEmissionAdmin() method in the emission_manager contract will be as follows:\n\n`EMISSION_MANAGER.setEmissionAdmin(sUSD, 0xac140648435d03f784879cd789130F22Ef588Fcd);`\n\nThis method will set the ACI multisig as the emission admin for the sUSD token on Optimism Aave V3 market.\n\n# Disclaimer\n\nThe Aave Chan Initiative is working with Synthetix to define the emissions program for sUSD. ACI has not been paid by any third party for this proposal.\n\n# Next Steps\n\n1. Gather feedback from the community.\n2. If consensus is reached on this ARFC, escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n3.

As a result, onboarding PYUSD into Aave has:\n\n- Built synergies between Aave and PYUSD.\n- Offered Aave users an additional stablecoin option.\n- Strengthened the relationship between the PYUSD & the GHO stablecoin.\n\nIn order to facilitate emissions by various stakeholders, ACI proposes becoming the emissions manager for PYUSD on Aave V3 Ethereum Market. Emission incentives will be sent to ACI multisig and distributed as agreed on with partners. By setting the multisig as the emission manager for the PYUSD token, the ACI will be able to directly manage incentive programs that can attract more users to the pool and stimulate activity.

This will enable Liquidity Observation Labs to define and fund incentive programs for all wstETH markets, including Scroll, promoting growth and expanding the user base of Aave.\n\n## Motivation\n\nGovernance have already approved setting Liquidity Observation Labs as Emission manager for wstETH on the current Aave V3 Markets. \n\nBut since Scroll market is live, the current ARFC is set to establish Liquidity Observation Labs as Emission manager for wstETH, aligning with the desire to actively contribute to the growth and development of the Aave V3. \n\nBy setting their wallet as the emission manager for the wstETH token, the Foundation will be able to directly fund incentive programs that can attract more users to the pool and stimulate activity. This aligns with the broader goals of the Aave community to foster active and engaged markets.\n\n## Specification\n\nThe Liquidity Observation Labs wallet address is:\n\nEmission Admin Wallet (Liquidity Observation Labs): [0xC18F11735C6a1941431cCC5BcF13AF0a052A5022](https://app.safe.global/home?safe=eth:0xC18F11735C6a1941431cCC5BcF13AF0a052A5022)\n\nThe AIP call setEmissionAdmin() method in the emission_manager contract.\n\n`EMISSION_MANAGER.setEmissionAdmin(wstETH,[0xC18F11735C6a1941431cCC5BcF13AF0a052A5022],EMISSION_ADMIN);`\n\nThis method will set the Liquidity Observation Labs wallet as the emission admin for the wstETH token on Scroll, besides the current Ethereum, Base, Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon and Gnosis V3 markets.\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThis proposal is powered by Skywards. The Aave Chan Initiative has not been paid by Liquidity Observation Labs or any third party for this proposal.\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. Gather feedback from the community and risk service providers.\n2. If consensus is reached on this ARFC, escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n3.
