        "body": "[BIP-698] Enable Gauge for wrsETH/wstETH [Optimism]\nPR with Payload\nhttps://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/1357\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThis is a proposal to enable uncapped Balancer gauge for wrsETH/wstETH pool on Optimism.\n\n**References/Useful links:**\n\n• [Website](https://kelpdao.xyz/restake/)\n• [Documentation](https://kelp.gitbook.io/kelp)\n• [Twitter](https://twitter.com/KelpDAO) \n\n**Protocol Description:**\n\nrsETH is one of the largest LST-based liquid restaked tokens on the EigenLayer ecosystem. It represents the liquidity of the underlying assets that have been deposited on Kelp. rsETH provides liquidity for the restaked positions, accumulates the rewards, and simplifies rewards management for AVSs. By providing liquidity for the restaked positions, wrsETH allows for a seamless experience to engage with DeFi activities and maximize rewards.\n\nstETH is a rebase token by Lido that also represents staked ether but instead of the exchange rate accumulation method, the staking rewards are given as extra stETH. Effectively, stETH always stays pegged 1:1 with ETH and stETH token balances are updated when the oracle reports the change in the total (initial deposit + staking rewards) every day. wstETH is the wrapped version of regular stETH which allows for stETH accumulation in the contract and turns the rebase model of stETH into the C-token model of other LSTs.\n\n**Motivation:**\n\nDevelop additional liquidity for wrsETH on Optimism\n\n**Specifications:**\n\n1. **Governance:** Kelp currently operates with a multi-sig wallet. The protocol is planning to transition to decentralized governance.\n\n2. **Oracles:**\n\n[wrsETH rate provider](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x1373a61449c26cc3f48c1b4c547322edaa36eb12)\n[wstETH rate provider](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x9aa3cd420f830E049e2b223D0b07D8c809C94d15)\n\n3. **Audits:**\n\n[Kelp’s smart contracts are audited by Sigma Prime and Code4rena](https://kelp.gitbook.io/kelp/audits)\n\n4. **Centralization vectors:**\n\nCentralization vectors currently are around upgradeability via proxy multi-sig and front-end hosting.\n\n5. **Market History:**\n\nKelp has seen meteoric growth in TVL in the last few weeks with TVL over 260k ETH and >50,000 holders of rsETH across mainnet and L2s.\n\n6. **Value:**\n\nThe wrsETH/wstETH pool is intended to grow into a major liquidity source for wrsETH or Optimism.

It represents the liquidity of the underlying assets that have been deposited on Kelp. rsETH provides liquidity for the restaked positions, accumulates the rewards, and simplifies rewards management for AVSs\n\nKelp has more than 260,000 ETH worth of assets restaked by over 40,000 users across multiple L2s. All of this is within 4 months of launch\n\nBy providing liquidity for the restaked positions, wrsETH allows for a seamless experience to engage with DeFi activities and maximize rewards.\n\n**Motivation:**\n\nKelp is seeking to establish the [rsETH/ETH on Arbitrum] and on Balancer to further enrich the liquidity of rsETH. This move aims to enhance the trading experience of users, making it more accessible for users while generating additional value for the Kelp community.\n\n**Specifications:**\n\n1. **Governance:** Kelp currently operates with a multi-sig wallet. The protocol is planning to transition to decentralized governance soon\n2. **Oracles:** Kelp is working with Redstone to create price feeds of rsETH.\n3. **Audits:** Kelp’s smart contracts are audited by Sigma Prime and Code4rena.\n4.

It represents the liquidity of the underlying assets that have been deposited on Kelp. rsETH provides liquidity for the restaked positions, accumulates the rewards, and simplifies rewards management for AVSs\n\nKelp has more than 260,000 ETH worth of assets restaked by over 40,000 users across multiple L2s. All of this is within 4 months of launch\n\nBy providing liquidity for the restaked positions, wrsETH allows for a seamless experience to engage with DeFi activities and maximize rewards.\n\nMotivation:\n\nKelp is seeking to establish the [wrsETH/ETH on Optimism] and on Balancer to further enrich the liquidity of wrsETH. This move aims to enhance the trading experience of users, making it more accessible for users while generating additional value for the Kelp community.\n\nSpecifications:\n\n1. Governance: Kelp currently operates with a multi-sig wallet. The protocol is planning to transition to decentralized governance soon\n\n2. Oracles: Kelp is working with Redstone to create price feeds of rsETH.\n\n3. Audits: Kelp’s smart contracts are audited by Sigma Prime and Code4rena.\n\n  1.

Centralization vectors: Centralization vectors currently are around upgradeability via proxy multi-sig and front-end hosting.\n\nOur goal is to migrate Kelp away from these vectors.\n\n5. Market History: Kelp has seen meteoric growth in TVL in the last few weeks with TVL over 260k ETH and >40,000 holders of rsETH across mainnet and L2s.\n\nThe balancer pools are already live and are available on Optimism\n\nOptimism pool: https://app.balancer.fi/#/optimism/pool/0x73a7fe27fe9545d53924e529acf11f3073841b9e000000000000000000000133\n\n6. Value: The balancer pool is the 2nd liquidity pool on Optimism and is aimed at providing liquidity to the growing community.\n\nTechnical Specifications:\n\nTransaction: The Balancer Maxi LM Multisig `eth:0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at 0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd and call the `addGauge` function with the following arguments:\n\ngauge(address): `0x65a5C255cfDDb99CAcCaCeE6f0FA63F3AB886e79`\n\ngaugeType(string): `Optimism`",

        "body": "### PR with Payloads\nhttps://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/782\n\n**Summary:**\nKelp proposes to add a veBAL gauge for the [rsETH/ETHx on Ethereum Mainnet] and [WETH/rsETH on Polygon zkEVM] on [Balancer]\n\n**Gauge Address:** \nMainnet: https://etherscan.io/address/0x0BcDb6d9b27Bd62d3De605393902C7d1a2c71Aab?\n\nPolygon zkEVM: https://etherscan.io/address/0x047301b311741ce6C007FFEF7f182Ec93ab07968#readContract\n\n**References/Useful links:**\n\n    • Website: https://kelpdao.xyz/restake/\n    • Documentation: https://kelp.gitbook.io/kelp\n    • Github Public Repo: https://github.com/Kelp-DAO/KelpDAO-contracts \n    • Twitter: https://twitter.com/KelpDAO\n\n**Protocol Description:**\n\nrsETH is the largest LST-based liquid restaked token on the EigenLayer ecosystem. It represents the liquidity of the underlying assets that have been deposited on Kelp. rsETH provides liquidity for the restaked positions, accumulates the rewards, and simplifies rewards management for AVSs\n\nKelp has more than 113,000 ETH worth of assets restaked by over 14,000 users. All of this is within 7 weeks of launching on Mainnet.\n\nBy providing liquidity for the restaked positions, rsETH allows for a seamless experience to engage with DeFi activities and maximize rewards.\n\n**Motivation:**\n\nKelp is seeking to establish the [rsETH/ETHx on Mainnet] and [WETH/rsETH on Polygon zkEVM] on Balancer to further enrich the liquidity of rsETH. This move aims to enhance the trading experience of users, making it more accessible for users while generating additional value for the Kelp community.\n\n**Specifications:**\n \n1. **Governance:** Kelp currently operates with a multi-sig wallet. The protocol is planning to transition to decentralized governance soon\n\n2. **Oracles:** Kelp is working with Redstone to create price feeds of rsETH.\n\n3. **Audits:** Kelp's smart contracts are audited by Sigma Prime and Code4rena. \nSigma Prime Report: https://kelpdao.xyz/audits/smartcontracts/SigmaPrime.pdf\nCode4rena: https://code4rena.com/reports/2023-11-kelp\n\n4. **Centralization vectors:** Centralization vectors currently are around upgradeability via proxy multi-sig and front-end hosting.\n\nOur goal is to migrate Kelp away from these vectors.\n\n5. **Market History:** Kelp has seen meteoric growth in TVL in the last few weeks with TVL over 113k ETH and >14,000 holders of rsETH.\n \nThe balancer pools are already live and are available here: \n\n[Mainnet Pool](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0x7761b6e0daa04e70637d81f1da7d186c205c2ade00000000000000000000065d) \n[Polygon zkEVM Pool](https://app.balancer.fi/#/zkevm/pool/0xffc865fcb34e754fad4b0144139b9c28c81c3eff00000000000000000000005f)\n\nGauges: \n[Mainnet Gauge](https://etherscan.io/address/0x0BcDb6d9b27Bd62d3De605393902C7d1a2c71Aab?)\n[Polygon zkEVM Gauge](https://etherscan.io/address/0x047301b311741ce6C007FFEF7f182Ec93ab07968#readContract  )\n\n6. **Value:** The balancer pool is the first liquidity pool on Polygon zkEVM and is aimed at providing liquidity to the growing community.\n\n**Technical Specifications:**\n\nTransaction: The Balancer Maxi LM Multisig eth:`0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd` and call the `addGauge` function with the following arguments:\ngauge(address):`0x0BcDb6d9b27Bd62d3De605393902C7d1a2c71Aab`\ngaugeType(string): `Ethereum`\n\ngauge(address):`0x047301b311741ce6C007FFEF7f182Ec93ab07968`\ngaugeType(string): `Polygon zkEVM`",
