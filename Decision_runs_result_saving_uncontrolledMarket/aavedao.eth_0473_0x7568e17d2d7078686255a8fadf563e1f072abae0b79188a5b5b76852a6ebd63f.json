Based on our analysis, we recommend increasing the Loan-To-Value (LTV) and Liquidation Threshold (LT) for WBTC and DAI, as we have determined that there is adequate on-chain liquidity to support significant liquidations. Similarly, we recommend reducing the Liquidation Penalty for WBTC, which is set conservatively at 10% to a lower level (8.5%) closer to that of USDC and Ethereum (5%).\n\n### Positions Analysis\n\nWe have not identified any outsized positions that are actively affecting our recommendations. However, we should call out that  ~40% of the on-chain supply of WBTC on Optimism is currently held on Aave, which calls for some caution. We have already proposed and implemented an [amendment to the supply cap](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-chaos-labs-supply-and-borrow-cap-updates-aave-v3-2023-02-24/12048/4) to limit the concentration of liquidity on Aave.\n\nGiven the blue-chip nature of BTC/WBTC, we expect significant arbitrage buying pressure to offset any slippage that may be created by future liquidations of WBTC and, therefore, recommend reducing the Liquidation Penalty even with the current significant liquidity concentration on Aave. We expect a lower LP to drive liquidators to liquidate positions in smaller portions, pacing the process and allowing the market more time to react. \n\n### Recommendations\n\n| Asset | Parameter | Current | Rec | Change |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| WBTC | Liquidation Threshold | 75% | 78% | +3% |\n| WBTC | Loan-to-Value | 70% | 73% | +3% |\n| WBTC | Liquidation Penalty | 10% | 8.5% | -1.5% |\n| DAI | Liquidation Threshold | 80% | 83% | +3% |\n| DAI | Loan-to-Value | 75% | 78% | +3% |",

This ensures more controlled changes and allows us to analyze their effect on user behavior before recommending further amendments to the parameters if the optimal configuration is outside this range.*\n\nPlease find more information on the parameter recommendation methodology [here](https://community.chaoslabs.xyz/aave/recommendations/methodology).\n\nYou can also view the simulation results and breakdown for the different assets by clicking on them on this [page](https://community.chaoslabs.xyz/aave/recommendations).\n\nThe output of our simulations reveals an opportunity to increase LTVs and LTs for WBTC, WETH, USDC, and DAI on V3 Arbitrum, resulting in improved capital efficiency of the system, with a negligible effect on the projected VaR (95th percentile of the protocol losses that will be accrued due to bad debt from under-collateralized accounts over 24 hours) and EVaR (Extreme VaR, the 99th percentile of the protocol losses that will be accrued due to bad debt from under-collateralized accounts over 24 hours)\n\n**Simulating all changes jointly yields a projected borrow increase of ~$510,000, with no increase in VaR and Extreme VaR compared to simulations with the current parameters.**\n\n \n![Screen Shot 2023-02-20 at 10.25.49 AM (1).png](ipfs://bafkreiedmb5tco5hbmc4yhosleztoqgzcxr73764wjmkaixl5nnifj7gtm)\n \n![Screen Shot 2023-02-16 at 11.33.14 AM (1).png](ipfs://bafkreiftwqqxkoyfunfkw5c7evs7l43nvw5rpw5pf22ritq6hnng5lisgq)\n\n![Screen Shot 2023-02-16 at 11.33.25 AM (1).png](ipfs://bafkreieg5hp7sxuypizbnkhpxl3g24iictd2kowldwcdw3tx4qpzxsjpn4)\n \n![Screen Shot 2023-02-16 at 11.33.36 AM (1).png](ipfs://bafkreicc75b27co2nqaglgol5ikam6hymu7ozpufcsek53aolhdn5nqt3a)\n    \n### Liquidity and Position Analysis:\n\nGenerally, the TVL in Aave on Arbitrum (98M$) compared to the overall chain trading volume (~$142M /daily over the past three months) should allow on-chain liquidity sources to absorb liquidations across the Arbitrum positions. \n\n![Screen Shot 2023-02-20 at 11.50.40 AM (1).png](ipfs://bafkreibnq7cnifmja4fdykrvzlq7q427q64rqtz4e3x3i5m6zyqyxophia)\n\n ![Screen Shot 2023-02-20 at 11.51.28 AM (1).png](ipfs://bafkreif2xf6f4t3a3fogjhgl2eefna5hbkhv5zvjlkekkdfnx7k3hjq3sy)\n*Source: [DeFiLlama](https://defillama.com/dexs/chains/arbitrum)*\n\nAs a result, Aave protocol on Arbitrum is expected to experience very low bad debt, even in extreme market conditions, across most assets. Specifically, the current values of LT and LTV for multiple assets can be safely increased to improve capital efficiency at a very low or no additional bad debt risk due to price volatility. This assumption is backed by simulation sweeps across a large range of values, measuring low Extreme Value-at-Risk (P99 bad debt) value even as LT is increased significantly.  \n\n**WETH and WBTC**\n\nWe have not identified any “whale” positions or activity affecting our recommendations.\n\n**USDC**\n\nWe have identified two large positions that supply ~45% of USDC on Arbitrum. One of these wallets does not borrow against its $7.63M USDC position. \n \n![Screen Shot 2023-02-20 at 10.36.20 AM (1).png](ipfs://bafkreifnwr76cat73zfoqygefsjw5dfyricuy4znggigvx65dj6suv6x7u)\n    \n![Screen Shot 2023-02-20 at 10.36.03 AM (1).png](ipfs://bafkreia5422d6c6kdhqxo4lbbqotplearpaugv2uysgidnfevvdiekla3q)\n    \nEven in the event of a change in the borrow usage (increasing disproportionately), the on-chain liquidity for USDC on Arbitrum should support its liquidation potential. \n\n \n![Screen Shot 2023-02-20 at 10.43.03 AM (1).png](ipfs://bafkreiffkksbpbhxapmdbyjqt4ubr5tkl7f27nrhmxsdkj7g3duh5fwkje)\n    \n**DAI**\n\nWe have identified one large position which supplies ~40% of DAI on Arbitrum and does not currently borrow against the position. \n\n \n![Screen Shot 2023-02-20 at 10.48.20 AM (1).png](ipfs://bafkreibtw255axxfnmb2yc5dqbld7rd4ont2l5rel3wkkitwiir6znquqi)\n    \nEven in the event of a change in the borrow usage (increasing disproportionately), the on-chain liquidity on Arbitrum should be able to support its liquidation potential. \n\n \n![Screen Shot 2023-02-20 at 11.06.52 AM (1).png](ipfs://bafkreidlqlkcfbf2v7e3baohwcljewz2pcr2npy65igecywzkrdls4f2oq)\n    \n### Recommendations\n\n| Asset | Parameter | Current | Rec| Change |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| WETH | Liquidation Threshold | 82.5% | 85% | +2.5% |\n| WETH | Loan-to-Value | 80% | 82.5% | +2.5% |\n| WBTC | Liquidation Threshold | 75% | 78% | +3% |\n| WBTC | Loan-to-Value | 70% | 73% | +3% |\n| WBTC | Liquidation Penalty | 10% | 7% | -3% |\n| DAI | Liquidation Threshold | 80% | 82% | +2% |\n| DAI | Loan-to-Value | 75% | 77% | +2% |\n| USDC | Liquidation Threshold | 85% | 86% | +1% |\n| USDC | Loan-to-Value | 80% | 81% | +1% | \n\n    \n \n    ",
