Eigenpie is an innovative SubDAO created by Magpie with $320M TVL, focusing on the restaking of ETH LSTs via EigenLayer. As a liquid restaking platform for Ethereum, Eigenpie’s core mechanism enables users to convert their Liquid Staked ETH tokens into Isolated Liquid Restaked ETH tokens. These are restaked versions of ETH LSTs, created by Eigenpie. This process allows users to earn passive income from Ethereum staking and EigenLayer revenue simultaneously without requiring a lockup period.\n\n**Motivation:**\nEigenpie aims to enable a gauge for mstETH/wstETH, substantially increasing its liquidity while supporting its utility and viability for integration into a range of DeFi protocols.\n\n**Specifications:**\n \n1. **Governance:** Currently, the protocol utilizes a multi-signature wallet. This will change with the evolution of the protocol, moving to decentralized governance with a DAO and a governance token.   \n\n2. **Oracles:** Rate providers have been used [wstETH](https://etherscan.io/address/0x72D07D7DcA67b8A406aD1Ec34ce969c90bFEE768#code) and [mstETH](https://etherscan.io/address/0xcc701e2d472dfa2857bf9ae24c263daa39fd2c61#code).(Under final review)\n\n\n3. **Audits:** [Blocksec](https://github.com/blocksecteam/audit-reports/blob/main/solidity/blocksec_eigenpie_1.0-signed.pdf), [Peckshield](https://github.com/peckshield/publications/blob/master/audit_reports/PeckShield-Audit-Report-Eigenpie-v1.0.pdf), [AstraSec](https://github.com/astrasecai/audit-reports/blob/main/AstraSec-AuditReport-Magpie-Eigenpie.pdf)\n4. **Centralization vectors:** Our smart contracts are upgradable contracts which are owned by a 3/6 multisig.\n\n5. **Market History:** No volatility. The Balancer pool has recently been launched.\n \n6. **Value:** The mstETH pool is intended to be a primary source of liquidity for the token on Ethereum. It will stimulate healthy volume and trading activity, providing the following value to Balancer:\n\n* **Primary Liquidity Source:** The pool establishes itself as a go-to destination for mstETH traders, offering deep liquidity and competitive pricing.\n* **Consistent Fee Generation:** As the pool's Total Value Locked (TVL) scales, it will drive substantial trading volume, generating significant swap fees for the Balancer DAO.\n\n**mstETH/wstETH pool on Balancer: https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0x51c72451eddfcc08aae540fd36434bb7ba340d33000000000000000000000683**\n\nmstETH/wstETH gauge on Balancer: [Gauge](https://etherscan.io/address/0x065885bDec1e571DC309d6d3576628419C13DB99)\n\n## Technical Specification:\n\nThe Balancer Maxi LM Multisig eth:0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860 will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at 0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd and call the addGauge function with the following arguments:\n\ngauge(address): `0x065885bDec1e571DC309d6d3576628419C13DB99`\n\ngaugeType(string): `Ethereum`",

See the previous proposal [BIP-320](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-320-enable-pal-ohm-80-20-gauge-arbitrum/4840) for further details. \n\nReferences/Useful links:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/Paladin_vote\nhttps://quest.paladin.vote/#/bal\nhttps://keep.paladin.vote/\n\n**Protocol Description:**\n\nPaladin is a governance lending protocol aiming to become the leading influence market and democratize activism.\nUp to date, we have released a lending market for stkAave GHO discount, as well as a vote incentive marketplace for Balancer, Curve and Bunni and an index product for governance wars.\n\n**Motivation:**\nPaladin already has a tight history with Balancer. The PAL token was made transferable via an [LBP on Balancer via Prime Launch ](https://launch.prime.xyz/lbp/0x531BCa3d4c1a53f856d90B0D4461E1f6Bd648f6D). And a Balancer pool on mainnet has been there since PAL has been liquid. We are moving our PAL/OHM pool into a PAL/ETH in order to bring in more volume and better arbitrage on Ethereum.\n\n**Specifications:**\n1. Governance: Paladin DAO is governed by holders of PAL, through snapshot votes and forum proposals.\n\n### [Paladin DAO](https://gov.paladin.vote/)\n\n[https://signal.paladin.vote/#/ 1](https://signal.paladin.vote/#/)\n\n2. Oracles: None, we use Coingecko.\n3. Audits:\n[Audits - Docs 1](https://doc.paladin.vote/security/audits)\n4. Centralization vectors: Treasury functions and smart contract proxy updates are controlled through a 5/9 multisig.\n5. Market History: PAL was made transferable on Balancer via a dutch auction and now has liquidity on 3 DEXs on Ethereum (Balancer, Curve & Uniswap). PAL has a total depth of ~1M$.\n\nGauge: [0x1461C4a373d27977f0D343Ba33C22870c89F9dF0](https://etherscan.io/address/0x1461C4a373d27977f0D343Ba33C22870c89F9dF0#code)\n\n**Specifications:** \n\nA. \nThe Balancer Maxi LM Multisig eth:`0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd` and call the addGauge function with the following arguments:\ngauge(address):`0x1461C4a373d27977f0D343Ba33C22870c89F9dF0`\ngaugeType(string): `Arbitrum`\n\nB. 4 weeks later: \n\nThe DAO Multisig `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` will interact with the `AuthorizerAdaptorEntrypoint` at `0xf5dECDB1f3d1ee384908Fbe16D2F0348AE43a9eA` and call performAction using `0xab8f0945` for the data(bytes) argument and `0xd758454bdf4df7ad85f7538dc9742648ef8e6d0a` will be used for the target(address) argument.",

These pools are key strategic pools, central to the long term growth strategy of Threshold DAO.\n\nThe DAO has budgeted T token bribes to incentivise this pool.\n\n## Specifications:\n\n### 1 Governance:\n\ntBTC operates on Threshold DAO’s decentralized threshold encryption protocol. Threshold DAO is governed by the network’s work token, T. T token holders govern the DAO via proposals raised to the Threshold forum, which can be raised to a vote via Snapshot, as well as the on-chain Governor Bravo module via Boardroom.\n\ntBTC contract deployments are currently managed via the Council multi-sig, a 6-of-9 multi sig managed by trusted community members: 0x9F6e831c8F8939DC0C830C6e492e7cEf4f9C2F5f\n\nIn the future, all contract authorities will be passed to the Governor Bravo contract.\n\n### 2 Oracles:\n\ntBTC does not rely on an oracle price feed.\n\n### 3 Audits:\n\nLeast Authority: https://leastauthority.com/blog/audits/audit-of-keep-network-tbtc-bridge-v2/\n\nChainsecurity: https://chainsecurity.com/security-audit/threshold-network/\n\nCertik: https://skynet.certik.com/projects/threshold-network\n\nImmunefi Bug Bounty: https://immunefi.com/bounty/thresholdnetwork/\n\n### 4 Centralization vectors:\n\nThreshold Network governance is decentralized, and updates are ratified by the DAO.\n\ntBTC contracts updates are currently managed by the Council multi-sig.\n\n### 5 Market History:\n\ntBTC is a wrapped BTC token, and is pegged to the price of BTC. Since launch, tBTC’s price has not significantly diverged from that of BTC. tBTC launched in January of 2023, and currently has ~2400 BTC to collateralize the ~2400 tBTC.\n\n### 6 Pool Details:\n\n#### tBTC/WETH Pool\n\nLink to Pool: [0x52e281318Fed4eFFfb8E46c0847a8f9B71a461A8](https://basescan.org/address/0x52e281318Fed4eFFfb8E46c0847a8f9B71a461A8)\n\nBase Gauge: [0xFA61fB6218378b9f01CA4B2b662B5c4d12915Db9](https://basescan.org/address/0xFA61fB6218378b9f01CA4B2b662B5c4d12915Db9)\n\nMainnet Gauge: [0xF6FA773b5E54F4BD20E09d806AB483d58dD55dcb](https://etherscan.io/address/0xF6FA773b5E54F4BD20E09d806AB483d58dD55dcb)\n\n#### tBTC/USDbC Pool\n\nLink to Pool: [0x036d68e4e0005da4ef1c9ebd53b948d2c083495e](https://basescan.org/address/0x036d68e4e0005da4ef1c9ebd53b948d2c083495e#readContract)\n\nBase Gauge: [0x4321edfE7dEC773A91316481FCb19D6ca6Dc5207](https://basescan.org/address/0x4321edfE7dEC773A91316481FCb19D6ca6Dc5207)\n\nMainnet Gauge: [0x156cC29C8dfA80821eD240C3cA4BA85103e10f2b](https://etherscan.io/address/0x156cC29C8dfA80821eD240C3cA4BA85103e10f2b)\n\n### Value:\n\nThe Balancer tBTC pools will support tBTC routing and liquidity on Base.\n\nThreshold DAO has allocated a portion of its incentives budget to bribe these pools Paladin. This will incentivise veBAL holders to vote on our gauge to direct protocol emissions and attract TVL as part of the Base tBTC growth strategy.\n\n Specification:\n\nThe Balancer Maxi LM Multisig eth:`0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd` and call the addGauge function with the following arguments:\ngauge(address):`0xF6FA773b5E54F4BD20E09d806AB483d58dD55dcb `\ngaugeType(string): `Base`\n\ngauge(address):`0x156cC29C8dfA80821eD240C3cA4BA85103e10f2b `\ngaugeType(string): `Base`",

        "body": "### [PR with Payload](https://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/363)\n\n**Summary:**\n\n>This proposal is to create a gauge for ETHx / bb-a-wETH on Ethereum.\n>\n>The pool shall use the ComposableStablePoolFactory-v4 which addresses the [reentrancy vulnerability](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/reentrancy-vulnerability-scope-expanded/4345) disclosed during February 2023. \n>\n>This gauge is uncapped, and would enter as a “core pool” under [BIP-19](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-19-incentivize-core-pools-l2-usage/3329). This means 65% of 50% of yield generated by this pool is to be used for bribing for votes on it via [Hidden Hand](https://hiddenhand.finance/balancer). The remaining 35% goes to Balancer DAO as revenue. \n\n**References/Useful links:**\n\n>* [Website](https://staderlabs.com/)\n>* [Documentation](https://trufin.gitbook.io/docs/)\n>* [Communities](https://twitter.com/staderlabs)\n>* [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/xJURAhSmav)\n>* [ETHx Contract](https://etherscan.io/token/0xA35b1B31Ce002FBF2058D22F30f95D405200A15b#tokenInfo)\n\n**Protocol Description:**\n\n>This pool utilises ETHx and linear pool bb-a-wETH which deposits wETH into Aave v3 wETH reserve. The linear pool utilises a wrapper developed by Aave Companies.\n\n**Motivation:**\n\n> This proposal aims to add a veBAL gauge for ETHx/bb-a-wETH on Ethereum.\n>\n>One of Balancer’s strategic objectives is to attract more yield bearing liquidity. Incentivizing the yield bearing token ETHx through a gauge proposal presents an opportunity to attract depsits into the liquidity pool. \n>\n>The primary pool for ETHx is to be on the Balancer Protocol. This further deepens the existing relationship with [MaticX/bb-a-wMATIC](https://app.balancer.fi/#/polygon/pool/0xe78b25c06db117fdf8f98583cdaaa6c92b79e917000000000000000000000b2b) and [SD/wETH](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0xe4010ef5e37dc23154680f23c4a0d48bfca91687000200000000000000000432) already deployed on Polygon and Ethereum respectively.\n>\n>Launching ETHx with the bb-a-wETH linear pool will provide additional yield for Liquidity Providers. This is due to the Aave v3 wETH reserve generation 178 bps of deposit yield. Balancer DAO will earn revenue from ETHx and bb-a-wETH derived yield. \n\n**Specifications:**\n\n1. **Governance:** \n\n> Please see the [litepaper](https://www.staderlabs.com/docs/ETHx%20Litepaper.pdf).\n\n2. **Oracles:**\n\n>* rateProvider0 (for ETHx):`[0xA35b1B31Ce002FBF2058D22F30f95D405200A15b](https://etherscan.io/address/0xA35b1B31Ce002FBF2058D22F30f95D405200A15b#writeProxyContract)`\n>* rateProvider1 (for bb-a-wETH): `[0x60D604890feaa0b5460B28A424407c24fe89374a](https://etherscan.io/address/0x60d604890feaa0b5460b28a424407c24fe89374a#readContract)`\n\n3. **Audits:**\n\n>* [Halborn](https://www.staderlabs.com/audits/ethx/StaderLabs_ETHx_Audit_Report_by_Halborn.pdf)\n>* [Sigma_Prime](https://www.staderlabs.com/audits/ethx/StaderLabs_ETHx_Audit_Report_by_Sigma_Prime.pdf)\n\n4. **Centralization vectors:** \n \n>* Stader Governance, see [here](TBA)\n\n5. **Market History:** \n>* ETHx is new and not yet integrated into Coingecko.\n>* bb-a-wETH has a long successful history within Balancer protocol.\n\n6. **Value:**\n>* This pool is a Core Pool and therefore will generate revenue for the DAO via ETHx and bb-a-wETH derived yield plus swap fees.\n\n**Pool Details**\n>Link to Pool: [0x4CbdE5C4B4B53EBE4aF4adB85404725985406163](https://etherscan.io/address/0x4CbdE5C4B4B53EBE4aF4adB85404725985406163)\n>Link to Gauges: [0x9e3f4FB69058244066801404e50889592d33cA11](https://etherscan.io/address/0x9e3f4FB69058244066801404e50889592d33cA11)\n>\n>The Balancer Maxi LM Multisig `eth:0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd` and call the addGauge function with the following arguments:\ngauge(address): `0x9e3f4FB69058244066801404e50889592d33cA11`\ngaugeType(string): Ethereum\n\n**Disclosure:**\n\n>This proposal is the work of @Llama contributor, @Matthew_Graham, via the legal entity TokenLogic.",
