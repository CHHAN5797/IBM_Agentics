        "body": "# Summary\n\nFollowing sUSD’s depeg, after which [the market was frozen on V3 Optimism](https://governance.aave.com/t/susd-depeg-update-05-16-2024/17719/13), we provide an update and recommend future actions.\n\n# Motivation\n\nsUSD depegged on May 16, 2024, with its price reaching a low of 0.915 relative to USDC. As it was depegging, we provided a full analysis of the cause and a recommendation to freeze its Optimism market; sUSD has since repegged.  \n\n### Market Response to Freezing\n\nFollowing the market being frozen on May 16, we observed gradual withdrawals over the next four days, with about 1M sUSD withdrawn. However, starting May 20, withdrawals accelerated, and there are currently 5.16M sUSD deposited in the market.\n\nOn the other hand, the sUSD borrowed has been relatively stable, decreasing from 4.3M sUSD at the time of the freeze to 4.17M sUSD now. This is despite sUSD remaining depegged until May 21, incentivizing users who borrowed the asset to repay their debt. \n\nSynthetix has also [announced](https://blog.synthetix.io/transitioning-to-synthetix-v3-scaling-susd-migrating-snx/) its transition plan for V3, which details how it will scale sUSD. These updates include expanding the collateral assets for sUSD from SNX alone to SNX, ETH, USDC, and other yield-generating collateral and governance-approved tokens. Additionally, the protocol has incentivized sUSD liquidity providers on Velodrome (Optimism; 10,000 OP tokens per week in the sUSD/USDC pool) and Curve (Ethereum; 20,000 SNX tokens per week in the sUSD/USDC/DAI/USDT pool); liquidity has begun to improve as a result of these incentives.\n\n### sUSD Exposure on Aave\n\nsUSD is listed on Aave V3 Optimism as a frozen collateral asset and Aave V2 Ethereum as a frozen, non-collateral asset. Since the freeze on Optimism, we have observed a sharp decrease in value borrowed against sUSD, as well as the amount borrowed against sUSD in E-Mode. The reduction in E-Mode borrowed against is especially important, given the high LT afforded in this market.§\n\n# Recommendations\n\n- **Reduce Supply and Borrow Caps on Aave V3, Optimism:** Given that the market’s size has decreased, as well as a decrease in on-chain supply — from 31M pre-freeze to 23.6M now — we recommend decreasing the supply and borrow caps ahead of unfreezing the asset. This will ensure that any future growth in the market is controlled and risk is minimized.\n    - We recommend setting the caps according to our initial listing methodology, in which we determine the amount of an asset that can be liquidated with slippage lower than the LB, set at 1% in the stablecoin E-mode, and recommend the supply cap be double that amount. This leads us to a recommendation of a 7M sUSD supply cap and a borrow cap set at 80% of the supply cap at 5.6M sUSD.\n\n- **Reduce Stablecoin E-Mode LT and LTV:** We recommend reducing E-Mode LT and LTV for stablecoins in Optimism’s Stablecoin E-Mode. Reducing LTs will make the protocol more resilient to any potential depegs in the future, ensuring that there is larger buffer in the event a stablecoin’s price falls and liquidations occur. Additionally, lowering LTV will slightly reduce users’ stablecoin-stablecoin borrowing power, again reducing risk in these markets.\n    - A 2% LT reduction on the Optimism V3 stablecoin E-mode category will make 18 accounts eligible for liquidation, potentially inducing $25K in new liquidations.\n- **Adjust sUSD’s LTV and LT:** Following the freeze of sUSD, its non-E-Mode LTV was dropped to 0%. Its current LT is 75%. Increasing the LTV will allow users to borrow non-stablecoin assets against their collateral, while adjusting the LT downwards will ensure the protocol has a larger buffer in the event of liquidations, whether from a depeg or from appreciation of borrowed assets.\n    - We recommend increasing sUSD’s non-E-Mode LTV to 60% and reducing its non-E-Mode LT to 70%. At this time, this would lead to a negligible $8 in liquidation across 4 accounts.\n\n- **Unfreeze the sUSD market on** **Optimism:** While sUSD has repegged, we note that the ongoing [deprecation](https://governance.aave.com/t/susd-depeg-update-05-16-2024/17719/7?) of synth assets may continue to cause peg volatility. The discount rate, which dictates the value synth asset holders can receive when they redeem, will continue to be lowered in an effort to deprecate these markets. Synth asset holders may request a redemption at parity, which, in the future, may carry some time-based conditions (i.e., sUSD is sent to the redeeming user over the course of weeks or months) to reduce the potential impact on sUSD’s peg. While the Synthetix Council has an incentive to ensure redemptions of synth assets with minimal price impacts, whether to the synth assets or sUSD, these time-based conditions are not codified.\n    - Given this, as well as the reduced supply/borrow caps and E-Mode LT/LTV, we recommend unfreezing the market.\n\n**We would like to thank @kaleb and the Synthetix team for their collaboration, insights on the situation, and guidance on the protocol and governance mechanisms to stabilize the peg.**\n\n# Specification\n\n| Asset | Parameter | Current  | Recommended |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| sUSD | Supply Cap | 20,000,000 | 7,000,000 |\n| sUSD | Borrow Cap | 13,000,000 | 5,600,000 |\n| sUSD | LT | 75% | 70% |\n| sUSD | LTV | 0.0% | 60% |\n\n### Stablecoin E-Mode Specifications\n\n| Parameter | Current  | Recommended |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| LTV | 93% | 90% |\n| LT | 95% | 93% |\n\n# Next Steps\n\n1.

        "body": "## Summary\n\nA proposal to adjust ten (10) total risk parameters, including Loan-to-Value and Liquidation Threshold, across five (5) Aave V3 assets.\n\n- GNO on Gnosis\n- OP on Optimism\n- ARB on Arbitrum\n- stMATIC on Polygon\n- MaticX on Polygon\n\n## Analysis\n\nIncreasing the liquidation threshold and LTV for assets allows Aave to enhance users’ capital efficiency. However, this must be balanced with proper risk management to ensure that there is a sufficient buffer in the event of large drawdowns and/or liquidations. The analyses below were conducted utilizing our LT simulations, which showed either minimal or no increases in VaR at the recommended LT levels, while also considering user distribution and on-chain liquidity.\n\n### GNO (Gnosis)\n\nGNO is in isolation mode with a debt ceiling of $2M, with $971K borrowed against it, split between USDC and WXDAI. The top suppliers of GNO have strong health scores of over 3, while some do not borrow against GNO.\n\nGiven the user distribution and liquidity, we recommend increasing the LT to 53% and the LTV to 48%.\n\n### OP (Optimism)\n\nUSDC and USDT are the most popular assets borrowed against OP collateral, together with DAI representing 71% of the total debt against OP. These positions are thus at risk of liquidation should OP’s price fall. \n\nHowever, the largest suppliers maintain relatively strong health scores and on-chain liquidity would support their liquidation.\n\nGiven these factors, we recommend increasing the LTV to 58% and the LT to 63%.\n\n### ARB (Arbitrum)\n\nThere is currently $5.64M borrowed against $28.5M ARB in this market, the majority of which is stablecoins.\n\nCollateral at risk increases smoothly as ARB’s price declines, and we find that on-chain liquidity can support efficient liquidations. \n\nGiven this, we recommend increasing the LTV to 58% and the LT to 63%.\n\n### stMATIC (Polygon)\n\nThere is $6.28M borrowed against $30.09M stMATIC in this market, with $2.4M of that borrowed in E-Mode. Non-E-Mode borrows are primarily of USDC.e.\n\nThe top suppliers maintain relatively strong health scores, with the largest borrowing just $82K against $12M stMATIC, putting this market at relatively lower risk of large scale liquidations.\n\nGiven these factors, we recommend increasing the LTV to 48% and the LT to 58%.\n\n### MaticX (Polygon)\n\n75% of the value borrowed against MaticX is associated with MATIC-correlated assets in E-Mode, putting these positions at a relatively lower risk of liquidation. Non-E-Mode borrows are primarily of stablecoins, with USCD.e the largest.\n\nThe largest MaticX suppliers are either looping with WMATIC, borrowing a small amount of WETH, or borrowing USDC.e. \n\nGiven on-chain liquidity and user distribution, we recommend increasing the LTV to 50% and the LT to 60%.\n\n## Specification\n\nGiven these observations, we recommend making the following changes:\n\n| Chain | Asset | Current LTV | Rec. LTV | Current LT | Rec. LT |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Gnosis | GNO | 45% | 48% | 50% | 53% |\n| Optimism | OP | 50% | 58% | 60% | 63% |\n| Arbitrum | ARB | 50% | 58% | 60% | 63% |\n| Polygon | stMATIC | 45% | 48% | 56% | 58% |\n| Polygon | MaticX | 45% | 50% | 58% | 60% |\n\n## Next Steps\n\nWe invite a community discussion around the proposed parameter updates and, barring community objection, will follow up with a Snapshot vote in five days.\n\n## **Disclaimer**\n\nChaos Labs has not been compensated by any third party for publishing this ARFC.\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain)",

        "body": "## Simple Summary\n\nA proposal to reduce the Liquidation Threshold (LT) and Loan-To-Value (LTV) and increase Liquidation Bonus (LB) and Reserve Factors (RF) for eleven (11) frozen collateral assets on Aave V2 Ethereum.\n\n## Motivation\n\nIn line with our ongoing commitment to reduce the potential risks associated with V2 markets, we suggest a phased reduction of the **frozen** V2 markets, comprising low-to-medium cap assets with limited liquidity. The following proposal is the first step to reduce capital efficiency across V2 collateral assets, which will be followed up with more detailed plans for additional parameter updates for these assets. \n\n### LT Reductions\n\nImplementing a gradual decrease in LTs effectively diminishes the borrowing power for the existing markets. This proposal offers the community two alternatives - a \"moderate\" and an \"aggressive\" approach for the preliminary LT reduction. \n\n- Aggressive (Chaos Recommendation) -  This option suggests a LT configuration that optimizes reductions without significantly increasing the number of accounts eligible for liquidation. The proposed values are set at a margin of 8% from the closest LT figure which would trigger more substantial liquidations, as can be seen in the supporting graphs [here](https://chaos-labs.notion.site/Supporting-Data-ARFC-Chaos-Labs-Risk-Parameter-Updates-Aave-V2-Ethereum-2023-6-23-338308b47db34c30a92204805f2a1972?pvs=4).\n- Moderate - If the community leans towards a more tempered approach of slowly reducing the Liquidation Thresholds, we propose limiting the LT decrease to a maximum of 10%. Hence, we define the “Moderate” option as the minimum between 10% or the value suggested by the aggressive approach.\n\n- “Aggressive”\n\n| Asset | Current LT | Rec LT | Value Liquidated | Accounts Liquidated |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| BAL | 70% | 55% | $60 | 5 |\n| BAT | 70% | 52% | $610 | 6 |\n| CVX | 45% | 40% | 0 | 1 |\n| DPI | 70% | 42% | 0 | 0 |\n| ENJ | 67% | 60% | $300 | 4 |\n| KNC | 70% | 1% | $1,790 | 7 |\n| MANA | 75% | 62% | $500 | 5 |\n| REN | 60% | 40% | $1,800 | 6 |\n| xSUSHI | 65% | 60% | 0 | 0 |\n| YFI | 65% | 55% | $500 | 2 |\n|ZRX|65%|45%|$500 | 5 |\n- “Moderate”\n\n| Asset | Current LT | Rec LT | Value Liquidated | Accounts Liquidated |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| BAL | 70% | 60% | 0 | 2 |\n| BAT | 70% | 60% | $200 | 3 |\n| CVX | 45% | 40% | 0 | 1 |\n| DPI | 70% | 60% | 0 | 0 |\n| ENJ | 67% | 60% | $300 | 4 |\n| KNC | 70% | 60% | $210 | 1 |\n| MANA | 75% | 65% | $400 | 4 |\n| REN | 60% | 50% | $300 | 4 |\n| xSUSHI | 65% | 60% | 0 | 0 |\n| YFI | 65% | 55% | $500 | 2 |\n|ZRX|65%|55%| 0 | 0|\n\nIn the tables below, we share data to quantify the effect of the recommended reductions on protocol users:\n\n|  | Value liquidated | Accounts liquidated |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| moderate | $1,970 | 20 |\n| aggressive | $4,900 | 34 |\n\n*As Liquidation Threshold reductions may lead to user accounts being eligible for liquidations upon their approval, we want to clarify the full implications to the community at each step. Chaos Labs will publicly communicate the planned amendments and list of affected accounts leading to the on-chain execution.*\n\n### Reduce LTV to zero\n\nLowering the Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio to zero can potentially curb borrowing by less sophisticated users. It's important to note that due to V2's design, users can bypass the LTV limit to borrow up to the LT value.\n\n### RF Increase\n\nProgressively increasing the reserve factors diminishes the interest rate for providing these assets and lowers the suppliers' incentive to supply the assets. In this proposal, we suggest an initial hike of 10% for all inactive assets.\n\n### LB Increase\n\nWe recommend increasing the LB for all proposed assets (excluding BAL and CVX) to 10% to better incentivize liquidations and accommodate for low liquidity for the given assets.\n\n## Specification\n\n| Asset | Cur LT | Rec LT* | Current LTV | Rec LTV | Current RF | Rec RF | Current LB | Rec LB |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| BAL | 70% | 60% / 55% | 65% | 0 | 20% | 30% | 8% | 8% |\n| BAT | 70% | 60% / 52% | 65% | 0 | 20% | 30% | 7.5% | 10% |\n| CVX | 45% | 40% | 35% | 0 | 20% | 30% | 8.5% | 8%  |\n| DPI | 70% | 60% / 42% | 65% | 0 | 20% | 30% | 7.5% | 10% |\n| ENJ | 67% | 60% | 60% | 0 | 20% | 30% | 6% | 10% |\n| KNC | 70% | 60% / 1% | 60% | 0 | 20% | 30% | 10% | 8%  |\n| MANA | 75% | 65% / 62% | 61.5% | 0 | 35% | 45% | 7.5% | 10% |\n| REN | 60% | 50% /40% | 55% | 0 | 20% | 30% | 7.5% | 10% |\n| xSUSHI | 65% | 60% | 50% | 0 | 35% | 45% | 8.5% | 10% |\n| YFI | 65% | 55% | 50% | 0 | 20% | 30% | 7.5% | 10% |\n| ZRX | 65% | 55% / 45% | 55% | 0 | 20% | 30% | 7.5% | 10% |\n\n*Recommended LT values will be finalized after the Snapshot between the aggressive and moderate options\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. Following community feedback, submit the ARFC for a snapshot vote for final approval.\n2.

        "body": "## Simple Summary\n\nA proposal to adjust five (5) total risk parameters, including Loan-to-Value, Liquidation Threshold, and Liquidation Bonus, across two (2) Aave V3 Optimism assets.\n\n## Motivation\n\nChaos Labs’ Parameter Recommendation Platform runs hundreds of thousands of agent-based off-chain and on-chain simulations to examine how different Aave V3 risk parameters configurations would behave under adverse market conditions - and find the optimal values to maximize protocol borrow usage while minimizing losses from liquidations and bad debt. \n\n*Note: As a general guideline, we limit the proposed changes by +-3% for all parameters as a high/low bound for a given proposal. This ensures more controlled changes and allows us to analyze their effect on user behavior before recommending further amendments to the parameters if the optimal configuration is outside this range.*\n\nPlease find more information on the parameter recommendation methodology [here](https://community.chaoslabs.xyz/aave/recommendations/methodology).\n\nYou can also view the simulation results and breakdown for the different assets by clicking on them on this [page](https://community.chaoslabs.xyz/aave/recommendations).\n\nThe output of our simulations reveals an opportunity to increase LTVs and LTs for WBTC and DAI on V3 Optimism, resulting in improved capital efficiency of the system, with no effect on the projected VaR (95th percentile of the protocol losses that will be accrued due to bad debt from under-collateralized accounts over 24 hours) and EVaR (Extreme VaR, the 99th percentile of the protocol losses that will be accrued due to bad debt from under-collateralized accounts over 24 hours)\n\n**Simulating all changes jointly yields a projected borrow increase of ~$155,000, with no increase in VaR and Extreme VaR compared to simulations with the current parameters.**\n\n \n![Untitled (30) (1).png](ipfs://bafkreifsuvfdgldiuwht446nposyfqsxkt5xatmfoh2xlqpfohsu6ozdne)\n\n \n![Untitled (31) (1).png](ipfs://bafkreif7g5o5w7coateogkysbd6sclmcbxbxqggbdkidd24bisuvzoasgi)\n    \n    \n\n### Liquidity Analysis:\n\nThe TVL in Aave on Optimism (118.71M$) is concentrated primarily on three blue-chip, high-liquidity assets, which together account for ~75% of the supplied assets in $ values: USDC (34%), WETH (28%), and WBTC (14%). Based on our analysis, we recommend increasing the Loan-To-Value (LTV) and Liquidation Threshold (LT) for WBTC and DAI, as we have determined that there is adequate on-chain liquidity to support significant liquidations. Similarly, we recommend reducing the Liquidation Penalty for WBTC, which is set conservatively at 10% to a lower level (8.5%) closer to that of USDC and Ethereum (5%).\n\n### Positions Analysis\n\nWe have not identified any outsized positions that are actively affecting our recommendations. However, we should call out that  ~40% of the on-chain supply of WBTC on Optimism is currently held on Aave, which calls for some caution. We have already proposed and implemented an [amendment to the supply cap](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-chaos-labs-supply-and-borrow-cap-updates-aave-v3-2023-02-24/12048/4) to limit the concentration of liquidity on Aave.\n\nGiven the blue-chip nature of BTC/WBTC, we expect significant arbitrage buying pressure to offset any slippage that may be created by future liquidations of WBTC and, therefore, recommend reducing the Liquidation Penalty even with the current significant liquidity concentration on Aave. We expect a lower LP to drive liquidators to liquidate positions in smaller portions, pacing the process and allowing the market more time to react. \n\n### Recommendations\n\n| Asset | Parameter | Current | Rec | Change |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| WBTC | Liquidation Threshold | 75% | 78% | +3% |\n| WBTC | Loan-to-Value | 70% | 73% | +3% |\n| WBTC | Liquidation Penalty | 10% | 8.5% | -1.5% |\n| DAI | Liquidation Threshold | 80% | 83% | +3% |\n| DAI | Loan-to-Value | 75% | 78% | +3% |",

        "body": "### Summary\n\nThis ARFC proposes to make adjustments to stablecoin interest rate models across Aave v2 and v3 markets. Specifically, this ARFC proposes to increase the slope 1 parameter for stablecoins to implement a 5% optimal borrow rate.\n\nForum discussion thread linked [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-increase-optimal-borrow-rates-for-ethereum-stablecoin-markets/15096).\n\n### Motivation\n\nOver the past several months, equilibrium stablecoin borrowing costs across the broader defi space have trended upwards, and may now be higher than the governance defined “optimal borrow rate” set within Aave’s stablecoin interest rate models. For example, Maker borrow and supply (DSR) rates have been mostly over 5% since mid August. Rates in tradfi have also risen significantly, with short term treasury bills yielding around 5.5% and even long term treasury rates rising to nearly 5% across various maturities.\n\nThis mismatch between Aave’s rate models and the broader market leads to a range of potential inefficiencies, including deadweight loss from the cost of liquidity being artificially constrained away from equilibrium value, and negative UX impact due to greater rate volatility when utilization is above the optimal ratio.\n\nFirst, we present data backing up the assertion that Aave’s current stablecoin rate models are not finding efficient market equilibriums. Then, we discuss the negative impacts of this including deadweight loss and UX impacts. Finally, we present a plan of adjustment that we estimate will address the market inefficiencies and lead to improved market utility across borrowers, suppliers, and the community of AAVE token holders.\n\n#### UX Impacts\n\nWe gathered block by block interest rate data for the largest stablecoin markets across v2 and v3 (USDC, USDT, and DAI) from 1 August to 7 October, block numbers 17816255 to 18300344. \n\nIn the middle of this period (28 August), Aave governance executed proposal 306, which added sDAI as collateral on v3 while increasing the slope1 parameter for DAI to 5% on both v2 and v3. This offers useful data to A/B test the premise of whether increasing the borrow rate at optimal utilization can help improve market functioning.\n\nReviewing data for the Aave v3 DAI market, we can see that the increase in slope1 was strikingly effective at reducing borrow rate volatility, with the percent of time utilization was above optimal point falling from 62% to below 1%. There were some confounding factors, such as market turbulence over CRV leveraged positions at the beginning of August, and Maker’s elevated 8% DSR rate effective from 4 August to 18 August. But we can see heightened rate volatility from utilization exceeding the optimal ratio persists even excluding these periods.\n\n![image](ipfs://bafkreihm2rujbkmv7o6lanrmlzqey5op32l56s4ac6z5hsdhkdmctkdftu)\nSource: [Stablecoins ARFC Market Data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EV1NfAlYEqpOkbusduCSC5srFHEAH8ijmr8gn7nAa-E/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n![image](ipfs://bafkreihueexjztvdyxf2gfegwrfclnr23dwuhrxcrgh3axgalsfc27ulcm)\nSource: [Block Analitica Aave Dashboard (DAI v3)](https://aave.blockanalitica.com/v3/ethereum/markets/DAI/)\n\nComparing this with historical rates data for Ethereum v3 USDC and USDT markets (shown below), we can see a significant reduction in borrow rate volatility from the increase in the slope1 parameter. Note that the USDC market seems to exhibit higher volatility because it has a slope1 parameter of 3.5%, vs 4% for the USDT market.\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreihwzbrm4e4vn7x7b62bkbsn6hmkzjtwdkv5i6mxos4rxvs2v6sfh4)\nSource: [Block Analitica Aave Dashboard (USDC v3)](https://aave.blockanalitica.com/v3/ethereum/markets/USDC/)\n\n![image](ipfs://bafkreidveiwtydsstbqa7yiy7aevrepjfdauqkgfenzeajehxjfmwc32d4)\nSource: [Block Analitica Aave Dashboard (USDT v3)](https://aave.blockanalitica.com/v3/ethereum/markets/USDT/)\n\nWe can expect reduced rate volatility to drive an increase in borrower participation. Paradoxically, raising the slope1 parameter for the DAI markets also seems to have been associated with a reduction in average (geometric mean) borrowing rates; for example, the average v3 DAI borrow cost from 1 August to 28 August (when proposal 306 was executed) was 6.49%, while the average rate from 28 August to 7 October was 4.56%.\n\nLooking at the USDC v3 market over the same 28 August to 7 September period, we see the average (geometric mean) borrowing rates were 4.52%, so similar to DAI after the adjustment to interest rate models but with much higher volatility. This supports the notion that raising slope1 can bring greater rate stability without negatively impacting borrower welfare.\n\n#### Deadweight Loss\n\nDeadweight loss is an economic concept that describes the loss of total utility created by a market when prices are artificially constrained either above or below the optimal equilibrium where supply and demand are in balance.\n\nIt is commonly demonstrated with graphs of the supply and demand curve; any quantities exchanged below borrowers’ (consumers’) marginal willingness to pay represents consumer surplus, while quantities exchanged over suppliers’ (producers’) marginal willingness to produce represents producer surplus, and together these represent the markets overall utility.\n\n![image](ipfs://bafkreiaxeijjhirs447bgwpqjltouti3kyjkilleuqob3tjq43j7apzmkm)\n    \nWhen prices are artificially constrained above or below the market equilibrium, this leads to a lower quantity of goods exchanged, which reduces the total area of consumer and producer surplus and creates an area on the graph showing reduced utility known as deadweight loss.\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreiaybtbjwlkyvl2bcak57kpmvdf2ozuwoxvs5anc7pi27ol767mbqa)\n    \nWith borrowing rates at optimal utilization falling below broader market levels, this can have the unintentional effect of constraining price below equilibrium value, which reduces overall utility of the Aave stablecoin markets. This has a likelihood to constrain market size growth over the medium term as suppliers are insufficiently incentivized to deposit more capital, while borrowers have a very low amount of liquidity available at reasonable prices before pushing the utilization above the optimal point and potentially pushing rates far above the market equilibrium.\n\n### Proposed Adjustments\n\nWe propose an adjustment to the variable slope1 parameter for stablecoins across Aave v2 and v3 markets to better align optimal utilization rates with the broader market. While the proposal initially referred only to Ethereum markets, we see similar high rate conditions persisting across markets on other chains and risk service providers have indicated support for updating optimal rates across all active Aave deployments.\n\nThis will result in borrowing rates at optimal utilization still being equal or slightly below most other defi options (eg. Maker and Spark rates), while significantly increasing supply rates. Increasing the expected supply rates for stablecoins on Aave v3 Ethereum market may lead to a bit more downward price pressure on GHO, but this is not expected to be material considering that users can already borrow GHO with sDAI collateral (at 5% collateral yield, likely higher than the average for other stablecoin markets after this change) and Aave governance is also considering additional measures to support the GHO peg.\n\n### Specification\n\n**Ethereum v2 Market:** \n\n- Set USDC slope1 to 5%\n- Set USDT slope1 to 5%\n- Set FRAX slope1 to 5%\n- Set sUSD slope1 to 5%\n- Set GUSD slope1 to 5%\n- Set LUSD slope1 to 5%\n- Set USDP slope1 to 5%\n\n**Ethereum v3 Market:** \n\n- Set USDC slope1 to 5%\n- Set USDT slope1 to 5%\n- Set LUSD slope1 to 5%\n- Set FRAX slope1 to 5%\n\n**Avalanche v2 Market:** \n\n- Set USDC slope1 to 5%\n- Set USDT slope1 to 5%\n- Set DAI slope1 to 5%\n\n**Avalanche v3 Market:** \n\n- Set USDC slope1 to 5%\n- Set USDT slope1 to 5%\n- Set DAI slope1 to 5%\n- Set MAI slope1 to 5%\n- Set FRAX slope1 to 5%\n\n**Polygon v2 Market:** \n\n- Set USDC slope1 to 5%\n- Set USDT slope1 to 5%\n- Set DAI slope1 to 5%\n\n**Polygon v3 Market:** \n\n- Set USDC slope1 to 5%\n- Set USDT slope1 to 5%\n- Set DAI slope1 to 5%\n- Set MAI slope1 to 5%\n\n**Optimism v3 Market:** \n\n- Set USDC slope1 to 5%\n- Set USDT slope1 to 5%\n- Set DAI slope1 to 5%\n- Set sUSD slope1 to 5%\n- Set LUSD slope1 to 5%\n- Set MAI slope1 to 5%\n\n**Arbitrum v3 Market:**\n\n- Set USDC slope1 to 5%\n- Set USDC.e slope1 to 5%\n- Set USDT slope1 to 5%\n- Set DAI slope1 to 5%\n- Set LUSD slope1 to 5%\n- Set FRAX slope1 to 5%\n- Set MAI slope1 to 5%\n\n**Base v3 Market:** \n\n- Increase USDC slope1 to 5%\n\n**Metis v3 Market:** \n\n- Increase USDC slope1 to 5%\n- Increase USDT slope1 to 5%\n\n### Disclaimer\n\nBlock Analitica is not presenting this ARFC on behalf of any third party and is not compensated for creating this ARFC.\n\nThis proposal is presented on an “as is” basis and without warranty of any kind.
