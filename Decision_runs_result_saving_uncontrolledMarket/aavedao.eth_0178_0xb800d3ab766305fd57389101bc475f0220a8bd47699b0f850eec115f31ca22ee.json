        "body": "---\n\ntitle: [ARFC] Deploy USDC and USDT GSM On Arbitrum\nauthor: @karpatkey_TokenLogic\ncreated: 2024-06-30\n\n---\n\n# Summary\n\nThis publication proposes deploying a USDC and USDT GHO Stability Module (GSM) on the Arbitrum network. The two GSMs are to be maintained by the GHO Stewards.\n\n# Motivation\n\nThe GSM provides stability to the GHO peg by enabling assets to be exchanged within a defined price band. Deploying a GSM on the Arbitrum network enables swaps to be filled without unnecessarily creating an arbitrage opportunity between networks. \n\nWith the LTIPP ARB grant coinciding with GHO being launched on Arbtirum, the Aave DAO can stimulate demand for GHO whilst also restricting the Bridge Facilitator mint cap to encourage users to mint GHO via the GSMs. User will also be able to swap USDC and USDT for GHO via aggregators that have integrated the GSM. This will lead to USDC and USDT being deposited into the GSM.\n\nWith a healthy balance of USDC and USDT in each respective GSM, the Bridge Facilitator cap can be raised more aggressively and a GHO Bucket Cap with Facilitor role can be introduced to Aave v3 on Arbitrum. \n\n# Specification\n\n\nThe below outline the proposed changes to be included in the governance proposal submission.\n\n## Ethereum\n\n### Arbitrum Focused Facilitator\n\n| Parameter  |     Value      | \n|    ---     |     :---:      |\n| Mint Cap   |     +2M Units  | \n\n### CCIP Bucket Capacity Adjustment\n\n| Parameter  |      Value      | \n|    ---     |      :---:      |\n| Mint Cap   |     +2M Units   |\n\n## Arbitrum\n\n### CCIP Facilitator Capacity Adjustment\n\n| Parameter  |      Value      | \n|     ---    |      :---:      |\n| Mint Cap   |     +2M Units   |\n\n### GSM Configuration\n\nThe below provides the initial configuration of the USDC and USDT GSMs that will be updated by the GHO Stewards post launch.\n\n| Parameter                         | Value   | \n| ------------------------             | :----:     | \n| Freeze Lower Bound        | $0.990 | \n| Freeze Upper Bound        | $1.010 |\n| Unfreeze Lower Bound     | $0.995 |\n| Unfreeze Upper Bound     | $1.005 |\n| Mint GHO Fee                   | 0.05% |\n| Burn GHO Fee                  | 0.20% | \n| Supply Cap                       | 1.00M  |\n\nAny deviation from the above will be shared in the comments section below prior to the AIP being submited for vote.\n\n# Disclosure\n\nTokenLogic and karpatkey receive no payment for this proposal. TokenLogic and karpatkey are both delegates within the Aave community.\n\n# Next Steps\n\n1. Gather feedback from the community.\n1. If consensus is reached on this ARFC, escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n1. If Snapshot outcome is YAE, the ALC will implement proposal.\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

While these two capacity increases fall under the Direct-to-AIP process, other future increases are not pre-approved and follow the ARFC process.\n\nTo facilitate the streamlining of GHO adoption on Arbitrum and other deployments beyond Ethereum, this publication proposes adjusting the following parameters to be included within the Direct-to-AIP process. \n\n* GHO Reserve Borrow Rate\n* CCIP Bridge\n* GHO Stability Module(s)\n* GHO Reserve funded exclusively from new facilitator on Ethereum\n\nThe Direct-to-AIP governance process enables the DAO to implement upgrades faster and more closely track market conditions. AIP votes will still be required until such time as the GHO Steward role is fully extended to support the new parameter adjustments not currently covered by the Risk Steward role.\n\nFor clarification, the following parameter adjustments are to continue following the ARFC process:\n\n* Safety Module emission rates\n* New GHO deployments\n* GHO Reserve Factor\n\nNote, risk parameters such as Supply Cap, Borrow Cap, and the ability to freeze a reserve are already approved as Direct-to-AIP with the implementation performed by the Risk Steward role.\n\n# Specification\n\nThis publication grants approval to adjust the following GHO related parameters via the Direct-to-AIP process.\n\n* GHO Reserve Borrow Rate\n* CCIP Bridge\n* GHO Stability Module(s)\n* GHO Reserve funded exclusively from new facilitator on Ethereum\n\nThis proposal covers the recent GHO on Arbitrum deployment and also, future GHO deployments beyond Ethereum.\n\n# Disclosure\n\nTokenLogic and karpatkey receive no payment for this proposal. TokenLogic and karpatkey are both delegates within the Aave community.\n\n# Next Steps\n\n1. Gather feedback from the community.\n2. If consensus is reached on this ARFC, escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n3. If Snapshot outcome is YAE, an AIP will be submitted to implement the proposed upgrade.\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

        "body": "---\n\nTitle: [ARFC] Polygon v2 Borrow Rate Adjustments\nAuthor: @karpatkey_TokenLogic & @ChaosLabs \nCreated: 2024-04-04\n\n---\n\n# Summary\n\nThis publication proposes gradually revising the Borrow Rate on Polygon v2 to provide further encouragement for users to migrate to Aave v3.\n\n# Motivation\n\nOver the last [8 months](https://governance-v2.aave.com/governance/proposal/284/) the Reserve Factor (RF) on Polygon v2 has gradually increased from as low as 21.00% to 99.99%. As a result, deposit yield converged to zero and the capital efficiency of Aave v2 has been reduced on Polygon.\n\nWith the RF now approaching the maximum across all reserves, this publication seek to gradually increase the cost of capital via periodic borrow rate adjustments, every two weeks in a predictable fashion.\n\nBased upon recent borrow rates behaviour, the market has demonstrated the ability to withstand periods of elevated borrowing rates. \n\n## Non Frozen Assets\n\nFor non-frozen assets, this proposal recommends increasing the Slope1 parameter by 75bps every two weeks, or 1.5% per month, to encourage further migration of users from v2 to v3. The outcome of this [vote](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0xe2dd228640c3cad93f5418c40c4b5743b3c6c85aa0aae9eee53cbdbca2ed5c2d) has been taken into consideration when drafting the current IR parameters included in this proposal.\n\nThe Slope2 parameter is to be revised to discourage utilisation exceeding the Uoptimal value. Note, several reserves are experiencing utilisation marginally exceeding Uoptimal. \n\nAs utilisation of each reserve decreases over time, the Uoptimal will be periodically lowered to discourage new debt positions emerging. Any proposed changes to the Uoptimal parameter will be presented via a separate ARFC. \n\nUpon implementation, this change will not trigger liquidation of any users funds and will gradually increase the cost for users who remain on v2. Please note, there is a Migration Tool that was developed by BGD to aid users migrating from v2 to v3. \n\nAssets in scope: DAI, MATIC, wBTC, wETH, USDC and USDT.\n\n## Frozen Assets\n\nEach frozen reserve contains a small portion of funds with a very minimal amount of debt. For these assets we recommend a more aggressive implementation: reduce the Uoptimal to 10.00%, revise Slope1 to 50.00% and Slope2 to 500.00% - with  the exception of BAL, which receives a Uoptimal of 20% due to current utilisation being around 15%.\n\nAssets in scope: BAL, CRV, DPI, GHST, LINK and SUSHI.\n\n# Specification\n\nThe following parameters are to be updated as follows:\n\n| Asset | Current Slope1 | Proposed Slope1 | Current Uoptimal | Proposed Uoptimal | Current Slope2 | Proposed Slope2 |\n| :---: |  :---: |  :---: |  :---: |  :---: |  :---:  |   :---:   |\n| BAL   | 27.00% | 50.00% | 65.00% | 20.00% | 236.00% | 500.00% |\n| CRV   | 17.00% | 50.00% | 25.00% | 10.00% | 392.00% | 500.00% |\n| DAI   | 12.00% | 12.75% | 71.00% | 71.00% | 105.00% |   200.00% |\n| GHST  |  7.00% | 50.00% | 23.00% | 10.00% | 413.00% | 500.00% |\n| LINK  |  7.00% | 50.00% | 25.00% | 10.00% | 402.00% | 500.00% |\n| USDT  | 12.00% | 12.75% | 52.00% | 52.00% | 236.00% |   236.00% |\n| wBTC  |  4.00% |  4.75% | 37.00% | 37.00% | 536.00% |   536.00% |\n| wETH  |  4.00% |  4.75% | 40.00% | 40.00% | 167.00% |   200.00% |\n| wMATIC|  6.00% |  6.75% | 48.00% | 48.00% | 440.00% |   500.00% |\n| wUSDC | 12.00% | 12.75% | 77.00% | 77.00% | 134.00% |   200.00% |\n\nSubject to approval from @ChaosLabs, a subsequent proposal will be submitted every two weeks.\n\n# Next Steps\n\n1) Gather feedback from the community.\n2) If consensus is reached on this ARFC, escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n3) If Snapshot outcome is YAE, escalate this proposal to AIP stage\n4) Review, and where applicable, submit an AIP every 2 weeks\n\n# Disclosure\n\nTokenLogic and karpatkey receive no payment for this proposal.

This is equivalent to 36,500 units of AAVE emissions per year worth an estimated $3,394,500 at an AAVE price of $93.00/unit. The current annualised accrued GHO revenue, with 50M units of supply and Borrow Rate of [12.26%](https://dune.com/queries/3206348/5447167) is 6.13M. The Aave DAO's GHO revenue is sufficient to replace the AAVE emissions to stkGHO holders and meaningfully contribute to offsetting other DAO expenses like [Merit](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-merit-is-forever-reward-system-program-extension/17336). \n\nWith a bullish GHO revenue outlook, migrating stkGHO holders' rewards from AAVE to GHO is a positive step forward for Aave DAO. As a direct result of this proposed change, the AAVE Emissions runway is extended by 13.89%. After a successful migration of stkGHO rewards to GHO, other Safety Modules can be evaluated for similar adjustments. In particular, stkBPT would make a good candidate once GHO supply is large enough to cover the corresponding $AAVE emissions.\n\n\nGiven the recent price action in the AAVE price and the resulting lower yield on the stkGHO category, this publication propose a 20% yield on current GHO deposits. This is equivalent to 4.33M annualised, 11,850 daily GHO spend on the stkGHO category. The reward rate will be periodically reviewed to ensure targets on supply and APR vary within reasonable ranges. In order to reduce governance burden, this post additionally proposes to pursuit future updates with direct-to-AIP proposals.\n\nDetails on GHO Revenue can be found on [TokenLogic's GHO Dashboard](https://aave.tokenlogic.com.au/gho-revenue).\n\nLonger term, we envisage migrating from fixed daily GHO emissions to GHO emissions to stkGHO holders being a function of the DAO's GHO nominated revenue. This publication represents the initial step of transitioning from AAVE to GHO, and then later to a more revenue correlated emission schedule. \n\n# Specification\n\nUpdate SM Category 3 - stkGHO as per the below:\n\n| Parameter                    |  Current | Proposed  |\n|    ---                       | :---:    | :---:     |\n| Reward Type (Token)          | AAVE     | GHO       |\n| Deposits (Current/Target)    | 21.43M   | 21.43M    |\n| Daily Withdrawal Limit (GHO) | 2.5M     | 2.5M      |\n| Daily Reward Amount (Units)  | 100.00   | 11,850.00 |\n| APR (%)                      | 15.84    | 20.00     |\n| Slashing (%)                 | 100.00   | 100.00    |\n| Emission Duration (Days)     | NA       | 180.00    |\n\nEnable future updates on GHO Emissions to the stkGHO Safety Module through direct-to-AIP proposals.\n\n# Disclosure\n\nTokenLogic and karpatkey receive no payment for this proposal. TokenLogic and karpatkey are both delegates within the Aave community.\n\n# Next Steps\n\n1) Gather feedback from the community.\n2) If consensus is reached on this ARFC, escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n3) If Snapshot outcome is YAE, escalate this proposal to AIP stage\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

        "body": "---\nTitle: [TEMP CHECK] BUIDL GSM\nAuthor: @aavelabs\nDate: 2024-09-04\n---\n\n## Summary\nThis Temp Check proposes to build and deploy GHO Stability Module (GSM) to support reserve allocation and management features enabling third party integrations, specifically supporting integration into the BlackRock BUIDL 90 infrastructure.\n\n## Motivation\nThe primary purpose of GHO Stability Module (GSM) is to ensure the stability of GHO in scenarios of increasing or decreasing demand, effectively providing 1:1 convertibility between GHO and the other asset within the specific GSM. In the case of GHO:USDC, this can result in a surplus of USDC that in current deployed implementation remains idle.\n\nAave Labs proposes to build a new instance of GSM that supports external integrations and related control mechanisms, specifically supporting BlackRock’s BUIDL. With this implementation GSM can be more capital efficient while maintaining the high standards of backing as USDC is backing the GHO.\n\nBUIDL 25 is deployed on the Ethereum network, providing onchain access to traditional financial assets managed by BlackRock Financial Management Inc., with BNY Mellon as custodian, Securitize as transfer agent, and PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as the appointed fund auditor. BUIDL offers a novel approach to the digital asset space by combining the reliability of traditional financial mechanisms with the efficiency and transparency of blockchain technology.\n\nBlackRock has partnered with Coinbase, Anchorage, Fireblocks, and Digital Bank NA as infrastructure providers, and with Circle for the onchain USDC redemption fund, ensuring instant liquidity for onchain participants.\n\nBUIDL is priced at $1 per token and pays daily accrued dividends directly to holders wallets in the form of new tokens each month. The fund allocates 100% of its assets in cash, U.S. Treasury bills, and repurchase agreements, allowing holders to earn yield while holding the token on the blockchain. BUIDL holders can transfer their tokens 24/7/365 to other pre-approved holders. Additionally, fund participants have flexible custody options, allowing them to choose how to hold their tokens.\n\nThe BUIDL fund currently has over $500 million in issuance 10, with Circle providing a $100 million USDC redemption fund that guarantees conversion from BUIDL back into USDC for use in the USDC GSM. As of now, the redemption fund has $74.7 million USDC available.\n\nThis GSM implementation sets the technical ability for the Aave DAO, essentially expanding yield sources into real-world assets (RWAs), and increasing the partnership opportunities with BlackRock. Additionally, it provides a hedge against fluctuating yield opportunities in DeFi markets.\n\n## Specification\nThe proposed GSM instance that will run in parallel with already existing GSMs, will enable 1:1 fixed-ratio swaps between USDC and GHO, utilizing the USDC surplus to mint BUIDL tokens. Thanks to instant redeemability between USDC and BUIDL, the GSM can mint and burn BUIDL in exchange for USDC based on user demand, ensuring a seamless experience similar to the existing GHO:USDC GSM. Swap fees will be accumulated in GHO, and dividends will be paid monthly in BUIDL.\n\nArchitecture may or may not integrate a USDC buffer to compensate the gas redemption cost of BUIDL for small swaps, subject to further evaluation.\n\nThe GSM contract code requires modifications to support GHO <> USDC conversions and dividend reception. Additionally, BUIDL holders must be registered/allowlisted, meaning the GSM itself must also be registered.\n\nA detailed specification will be shared during the ARFC phase.\n\n## Next Steps\nIf Snapshot outcome is YAE, escalate this proposal to the ARFC stage.",
