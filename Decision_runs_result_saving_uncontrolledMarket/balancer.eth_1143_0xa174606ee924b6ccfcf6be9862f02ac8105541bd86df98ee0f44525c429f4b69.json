This will  allow arbitrageurs to drain remaining value from the pool.\n- This BIP is a actions a plan to unpause the pools early, and run the arbitrage.\n   - Once the exact amount recovered is known, another BIP will be brought forward to proportionally distribute the recovered funds to remaining bb-e-usd holders as of the block of the Arbitrage.\n- After this point, bb-e-usd burns will render a value of almost 0 and will in no case be worth the gas.\n- Special thanks to TempleDAO for providing the eDAI and eUSDC required to run this process.\n\n\n## Background/Context\n\nAs initially described in [this RFC](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/rfc-bb-e-usd-permissioned-arbitrage-to-rescue-non-withdrawn-funds/4744).   There is still a significant amount of value left in bb-e-usd, a vast majority of which belongs to Inverse Finance.  \n\nSince the time of the RFC posted above,  The Balancer Maxis have spent time working with TempleDAO, Euler, and Inverse to ensure that all required conditions are met on-chain to run the arb.   Euler patched a contract, Temple sent eTokens to the Balancer DAO Multisig.  \n\nThe PoC has been improved to use a smart contract, deployed [here](https://etherscan.io/address/0xF23d8342881eDECcED51EA694AC21C2B68440929#code).  This removes most of the issues that could occur between the time the payload was generated and the time the transaction is executed(about a week for governance).\n\nSince the RFC, it was also decided that it would be safer/better not to try to atomically distribute the proceeds from the arbitrage in the same transaction as the arbitrage itself, and instead to do a second BIP/execute at a later date.\n\n## Specification\n\nIf this BIP is passed, the attached payload will be executed as soon as possible.\n\nIt takes the following steps:\n\n1. Grants unpause permissions to Euler Linear Pools to the DAO Multisig.\n2. Unpauses bb-e-usdc and bb-e-dai\n3. Internally transfers all of the eDAI and eUSDC in the DAO Multisig to the helper contract `0xF23d8342881eDECcED51EA694AC21C2B68440929`\n4. calls the do_arb function on the smart contract in order to activate the arbitrage\n5. Removes pause rights from the DAO multisig.\n\nThe Pause window is now in a grace period, so it is not possible to repause the pools.  Following execution of this BIP bb-e-usdc,  bb-e-dai will be in an unpaused state.\n\n### Important Note\nThe payload provided is slightly sensitive to changes in market conditions.  As such there is a dust factor.  This changes the amount of funds left in the pool to handle paying fees for trading the \"wrong direction\" in an off balance linear pool.  Note that these fees could only be collected by an arb who rebalanced the pool, which does not seem very possible/sensible so they should be considered lost value.\n\nInverse is clearly very concerned about recovering their coins.  The Maxi's therefore ask permission to recheck this payload before it is loaded on the DAO multisig, and in the event of a failed simulation,  update the dust factors, currently set to [350,300] as required.  No other changes to the payload will be made.  \n\n## Onward steps\nFollowing execution of this BIP, governance will be brought forward to distribute the proceeds, and internally transfer remaining eTokens back to the TempleDAO multisig. \n\n\n## Review Requirements\nNote that the payload and contract submitted have not been reviewed by anyone outside the Maxis.  This BIP will not be executed until at least 1 review by a trusted and skilled engineers outside the Maxis is posted in response to this forum post.   We welcome anyone interested to complete and post such a review.  A request has been submitted to the Integrations Team to provide said review.\n\n## More about Pausing\nNew Balancer pool types and contracts generally include a 90 day Pause window as part of the launch process.  If Pause is called during this time, a 90 day grace period kicks in, after which point the pool automatically unpauses.  The Euler linear pools had been deployed less than 90 days before the Euler exploit making the pause possible.  Following the end of the pause window, pausing of the pool is no longer possible.\n\nYou can read more about pausing here:\nhttps://forum.balancer.fi/t/proposal-boosted-pools-authorize-balancer-labs-to-emergency-pause/2399\nNote that since this time, pause rights have moved from the blabs ops multisig to the [Emergency SubDAO](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/form-the-emergency-subdao/3197)\nhttps://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-139-update-emergency-subdao-permissions/4174\n\nA full list of current mainnet permissions can be found here:\nhttps://docs.balancer.fi/reference/authorizer/mainnet.html",

        "body": "# **Introduction**\n\nBalancer's access control system is based on permissions, which can be granted and revoked. These are controlled by the `Authorizer` contract, which was deployed along with the `Vault` in April 2021.\n\nThis proposal aims to replace it with the `TimelockAuthorizer`, which provides more fine-grained control over permissions, as well as new security features. It additionally addresses a bug in the `AuthorizerAdaptor` contract that was disclosed via the Immunefi bug bounty program.\n\nFor simplicity, this migration will initially only take place on the main Ethereum network and none of the L2s or sidechains.\n\n# **Specification**\n\nThe `TimelockAuthorizer` contract (developed by Balancer Labs) is a drop-in replacement of the current `Authorizer` contract, enabling new use cases and providing security improvements.\n\nI encourage everyone to read more about each of these improvements, as they will ****greatly impact the operation of the Balancer DAO**** if this proposal where to pass (particularly the 'Delays' section).\n\n## **Granular Permissions**\n\nAs of today, permissions are global: an account with a permission can use it on any contract in the entire network. For singleton contracts (like the `Vault` or the `ProtocolFeeWithdrawer`) this is not an issue since there is only one of them. However, for contracts with multiple instances (like liquidity pools) this means that an account with e.g. permission to set swap fees can use that permission on *_any_* pool of the same type (i.e. that is created in the same factory).\n\n`TimelockAuthorizer` allows granting permissions over a single contract, meaning it will e.g. be possible to allow an account to manage a single pool's swap fees while not being able to do the same on any other pool. This has always been supported on the original `IAuthorizer` interface - the current `Authorizer` simply did not implement this capability (for simplicity).\n\nIt will still be possible to grant global permissions by passing the special sentinel address known as `EVERYWHERE` (equal to `0xFFfFfFffFFfffFFfFFfFFFFFffFFFffffFfFFFfF`).\n\n## **Granters and Revokers**\n\nThe current `Authorizer` features a single all-powerful role (`0x00..00`), currently held by the Balancer DAO Governance Multisig (`0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f`). Accounts with this role can grant and revoke any permission - but they are the only one that can do so.\n\n`TimelockAuthorizer` instead distinguishes between having a permission and being a *_granter_* or a *_revoker_* for a permission. This will increase the capacity of the the DAO Governance Multisig to delegate subtasks to other accounts. For example, instead of simply granting permission to trigger the Liquidity Mining BAL bridging process to the Balancer Labs Operations Multisig, it could make said multisig a *_granter_*, increasing flexibility (e.g. letting Balancer Labs develop contracts that trigger this process automatically and grant them permission to operate without having to involve the Governance Multisig).\n\nThe `TimelockAuthorizer` also has a *_root_* account, initially set to the Balancer DAO Governance Multisig, which always has permission to grant and revoke all permissions, and to create and destroy granters and revokers. These permissions cannot be revoked by anyone (except by transferring *_root_* to a different account), meaning it always retains full control over the system and can safely evict any rogue granters or revokers.\n\n## **Delays**\n\nArguably the most important feature of the `TimelockAuthorizer` is the capacity to assign *_minimum delays_* to certain actions. If an action has a delay, then accounts with that permission cannot immediately execute said action: they can only *_schedule_* an execution at some time in the future (greater than the action's delay).\n\nCritically, these scheduled executions can be cancelled, which lets the community detect and stop malicious or erroneous actions after they are committed on-chain but ****before they are actually executed****, greatly decreasing the risk of user error, phishing attacks, etc. This also provides users who are not happy with a future action (e.g. increased fees) with the opportunity to exit the system before those measures take place.\n\nIt is also possible to assign ****delays to the granting and revoking**** of permissions. By e.g. delaying granting and revoking the permission to mint BAL (currently only held by the automated Liquidity Mining system), we end up with a much stronger committment to said system, and greatly reduce the risk of e.g. a malicious actor somehow acquiring minting capabilities. Similar measures can be applied to other powerful permissions, such as relayer privilege, adding gauge factories to the `GaugeAdder`, etc.\n\nIn general, if a multisig wields a permission (e.g. adding gauges) then its *_execution_* should have a delay (to review the multisig's action). Instead, if a contract wields a permission (e.g. the `GaugeAdder`) then its *_granting_* should be delayed (to review the code of the contract that will use it).\n\nFor more information on how delays relate to security, see [my talk at the DeFi Security Summit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRTTplIdxfI).\n\n## **Authorizer Adaptor Entrypoint**\n\n[ChainSecurity](https://chainsecurity.com/) submitted a vulnerability disclosure via the [Immunefi bug bounty program](https://immunefi.com/bounty/balancer/) that relates to the operation of the `AuthorizerAdaptor`. Said issue was promptly mitigated and resolved, but operation of some components of the system (particularly adding reward tokens and killing gauges) has been degraded as a result. The `TimelockAuthorizer` includes a fix for this in the form of the `AuthorizerAdaptorEntrypoint`, which provides a secure way to restore regular operation.\n\n# **Migration Procedure**\n\nTo ease the transition to this new system, Balancer Labs has also developed the `TimelockAuthorizerMigrator` contract, which prepares the `TimelockAuthorizer` by granting some of the permissions that exist in the current `Authorizer`, as well as setting up some initial delays.\n\nIn order to complete the migration, the migrator needs permission to call `setAuthorizer` in the `Vault`, which can only be granted by the Balancer DAO Governance Multisig. Additionally, the Multisig must also claim the *_root_* role in the `TimelockAuthorizer`, completing the *_root_* transfer from the migrator to the Multisig. This ****cannot be done before January 5th, 2023****, since the root transfer has a minimum delay of 30 days.\n\n## Execution Details\n\nFrom the Balancer DAO Governance Multisig (`0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f`):\n\n- Call `grantRole` on the `Authorizer` (`0xA331D84eC860Bf466b4CdCcFb4aC09a1B43F3aE6`) with:\n\n* `role`: `0x1cbb503dcc0f4acaedf71a098211ff8b15a220fc26a6974a8d9deaab040fa6e0`\n\n* `account`: `0xf8ee6f1F9B54F9b2C192D703ea2d22112cBC062b`\n\n- Call `claimRoot` on the `TimelockAuthorizer` (`0x9E3cD0606Db55ac68845bB60121847823712ae05`)\n\nThe `role` argument corresponds to [the permission to call `setAuthorizer` on the `Vault`](https://github.com/balancer-labs/balancer-v2-monorepo/blob/master/pkg/deployments/action-ids/mainnet/action-ids.json#L30), and `account` is the [`TimelockAuthorizerMigrator`](https://github.com/balancer-labs/balancer-v2-monorepo/blob/master/pkg/deployments/tasks/20221202-timelock-authorizer/output/mainnet.json#L2).\n\nThe `TimelockAuthorizer` address can also be found [in its deployment](https://github.com/balancer-labs/balancer-v2-monorepo/blob/master/pkg/deployments/tasks/20221202-timelock-authorizer/output/mainnet.json#L4).\n\n**Recall that `claimRoot` cannot be called until January 5th, 2023.**\n\nOnce these two steps are done, any account in the network can call `finalizeMigration` on the `TimelockAuthorizerMigrator` (`0xf8ee6f1F9B54F9b2C192D703ea2d22112cBC062b`) to complete the process.\n\n# **Initial Configuration**\n\n **No new permissions will be granted**. The Migrator contract ensures that all permissions granted during the migration exist in the current `Authorizer`. Some of the current permissions have been left out however, since they no longer apply (e.g. permission to pause the `Vault`, which can no longer be paused as of July 2021).\n\nAny permissions granted after the deployment of the `TimelockAuthorizer` (Nov 30th) **are not automatically migrated**, and will have to be re-granted after the migration.\n\n## **Initial Delays**\n\nThe following actions have initial delays associated to them. As a rule of thumb, I propose that we assign delays to actions with high impact and that do not require urgent execution.\n\n### **Execution**\n\n- `Vault.setAuthorizer`, 30 days. All delays must be shorter or equal to this one, as they could be otherwise bypassed by simply changing the Authorizer and removing delays entirely.\n- `SmartWalletChecker.allowlistAddress`, 7 days. Once veBAL is locked this cannot be undone in any way, so extra care should be taken when adding contracts to the allowlist.\n- `VotingEscrowDelegationProxy.setDelegation`, 14 days. veBAL boost upgrades are infrequent and should be handled with care, since they can greatly affect the veBAL operation.\n- `GaugeAdder.addGaugeFactory`, 14 days. Adding new gauge factories is a critical action as it grants them permission to mint BAL. See [my talk at ETHLatam (in Spanish)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5IDfJQGVk) for more details.\n\n### **Granting**\n\n- `BalancerTokenAdmin.mint`, 30 days. This prevents other accounts from being able to mint BAL.\n- `ProtocolFeesCollector.withdrawCollectedFees`, 30 days. This prevents bypassing the `ProtocolFeesWithdrawer`.\n- `GaugeController.addGauge`, 14 days. This prevents bypassing the `GaugeAadder`.\n- `BALTokenHolder.withdrawFunds`, 7 days. This manages the BAL minted for the veBAL gauge.\n- Vault relayer permissions, 7 days. Relayers are quite powerful, so creating them should be carefully reviewed.\n\nThe creation of the full list of permissions and their delays can be inspected in [this script](https://github.com/balancer-labs/balancer-v2-monorepo/blob/master/pkg/deployments/tasks/20221202-timelock-authorizer/input/mainnet.ts).\n\n# **Risk**\n\nThe `TimelockAuthorizer` is a relatively complex contract, which will be used to manage all permissions on the Balancer ecosystem, including the Liquidity Mining program and management of Protocol Fees. As such, care should be taken to review it.\n\nThe Balancer Labs team has been working on this contract for around 8 months, and we are confident in its correctness. It has been [audited by ABDK](https://github.com/balancer-labs/balancer-v2-monorepo/blob/master/audits/abdk/2022-04-15.pdf), and we're currently working with Certora to conduct a second review.",

        "body": "This proposal appears on [Balancer's forum](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/decide-on-gauge-unexpected-behavior/2960).\n\n# Introduction\n\nOn Monday afternoon, during a knowledge-sharing session between Balancer Labs's engineers, we realized that the veCRV smart contracts that form the basis of the veBAL system operate differently from our initial expectations.\n\nNo user funds are at stake, nor is any immediate action from Liquidity Providers required. The veBAL contract also remains safe and will continue to allow current and future holders to vote on the allocation of weekly BAL emissions for Balancer pools.\n\nOur initial understanding was that the gauge type weights (`_get_type_weight`) in the Gauge Controller contract would allow us to implement classes of gauges, such that the share of emissions directed to each class (a \"gauge type\") would be controlled by Balancer governance (see the Gauge types section of the veBAL Tokenomics proposal[[1]](https://snapshot.org/#/balancer.eth/proposal/0x9fe19c491cf90ed2e3ed9c15761c43d39fd1fb732a940aba8058ff69787ee90a)).\n\nThe intended outcome was for BAL emissions to be allocated as follows:\n\n* 10% to veBAL holders\n* 56% to Ethereum Pools\n* 7% to Arbitrum Pools\n* 17% to Polygon Pools\n* 10% to the Liquidity Mining Committee, for partnerships\n\nveBAL holders would then vote on-chain on how to distribute the 56/17/7% allocations among Liquidity Pools in those networks.\n\nIn reality, such implementation is not possible in the original veCRV system. Implementing this would require substantially changing the system, reducing compatibility with apps built on top of Curve's ecosystem - one of the key expected benefits outlined in the veBAL proposal.\n\nWhat this means for the veBAL system as currently deployed is that:\n\n1. mainnet gauges have been minting ~100% of weekly emissions instead of 56%; and\n2. contrary to our original intent/expectations, no other gauges will be able to mint any significant amounts of BAL on April 14th.\n\nWe'll be conducting a thorough post-mortem to identify what we could have done differently, and make changes to our internal processes so as to prevent this from happening again. In the meantime, the Balancer community must now make a decision.\n\n# Specification\n\nThis proposal provides two options below for how governance can proceed. In both options the LM committee is proposed to be eliminated as everyone showed support for this (even the LM committee itself). \n\n## Option 1: keep the system as it is\n\nThis means that through the on-chain gauge voting mechanism, veBAL holders have full control over the allocation of weekly BAL emissions. Gauges would be created so that veBAL holders would be able to direct incentives to themselves (that is, to all veBAL holders) or to pools on Polygon and Arbitrum, in addition to the existing gauges on Ethereum mainnet.\n\nA 10% cap would be imposed on weekly emissions to veBAL holders, with any excess being sent to the Balancer DAO treasury.\n\n### Pros:\n\n* No redeployment or migration necessary: LPs wouldn't have to take any action.\n* The system would become more similar to Curve's, which has no weekly allocation to veCRV holders. Balancer would still have this options available, but the amount would be defined directly by veBAL voting (up to the 10% cap) instead of being fixed at 10% as initially proposed.\n\n### Cons / Risks:\n\n* The original fixed weight distribution to veBAL holders won't be possible. It will still be possible to achieve this through veBAL votes, but the outcome would no longer be predictable. The veBAL gauge may get less than 10% of the votes, leading to fewer tokens being allocated to veBAL holders, or more than 10%, reducing the size of liquidity incentives for Pools (funding the DAO treasury in the process).\n\n## Option 2: deploy a new version of the gauge system\n\nThis is the closest we can get to a system that behaves as described in the veBAL proposal without significant changes to the veCRV system.\n\n1. The current BAL Minter contract would have its minting permission revoked.\n2. Three new BAL Minter contracts would be deployed, enforcing that 10% of emissions are allocated to veBAL holders, and 90% are controlled by veBAL holders through the on-chain gauge voting mechanism.\n3. A new GaugeController and a new GaugeFactory for mainnet pools would be deployed.\n4. The existing veBAL contract would have voting power over this new GaugeController: no migration is needed on the part of veBAL holders.\n\nIt would still not be possible to implement the 56/17/7% split between mainnet/Polygon/Arbitrum as outlined in the veBAL proposal. The distribution across the 3 networks (and any additional network Balancer may be deployed to in the future) will be fully defined by veBAL voting power (this is also true in option 1).\n\n### Pros:\n\n* The original fixed allocation to veBAL holders in the veBAL proposal would be achieved: veBAL holders would get 10% of weekly emissions.\n\n### Cons / Risks:\n\n* This will require a migration of staking positions. New gauges would be deployed on mainnet to replace the existing ones. Liquidity providers would be required to unstake from the current gauges and stake into the new ones in order to continue to receive incentives (as part of this proposal, the Balancer treasury would reimburse the gas costs of these operations).\nLiquidity providers that don’t migrate before a transition period finishes would not get BAL until they do so.\n* Current votes would be lost and veBAL holders would have to recast their votes to mainnet gauges (the impact of this could be low, assuming most would recast anyway when L2 gauges were to be released).\n* The gauge for the wstETH/WETH pool is also receiving LDO on top of BAL from the veBAL program. As LPs unstake from this gauge to stake in the new one, they would lose any potential LDO for the remainder of the week.\n\nAn airdrop of BAL through a Merkle Orchard (the legacy LM distribution system) would happen for those who did not claim their BAL from LM in the current system before the migration, along with a reimbursement for migration gas costs. LPs that migrate to the new gauges will be accounted for as if they had not unstaked from the current gauges.\n\n## Implementation\n\nThe governance multisig needs to call the authorizer[[2]](https://etherscan.io/address/0xa331d84ec860bf466b4cdccfb4ac09a1b43f3ae6#code) with the following inputs: `authorizer.grantRole(0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000, coordinator)` , which means it will grant full admin powers to the coordinator smart contract.\n\nSince the coordinator hasn’t been deployed yet, its address is not known. However, the Balancer community will be able to verify the coordinator address by that date on Balancer’s github in the deployment output folder[[3]](https://github.com/balancer-labs/balancer-v2-monorepo/blob/master/pkg/deployments/tasks/20220418-veBAL-gauge-fix-coordinator/output/mainnet.json). This link will point to a json file with entry `veBALGaugeFixCoordinator` followed by the coordinator’s address on mainnet:\n`{   veBALGaugeFixCoordinator: 0xabced...., }`\n\nAfter applying the necessary changes voted, the coordinator will renounce all given permissions and will not be usable anymore.\n\n## Coordinator Actions\n\nThe actions to be performed by the coordinator depend on the option chosen by the community.\n\n### Option 1\n\nThe coordinator will mint the missing 98.6k BAL meant for veBAL holders, as well as Polygon and Arbitrum LPs. These tokens will be sent to the recipient contracts of the gauges, resulting in the same outcome as if the gauges had minted the tokens.\n\nThen, the gauge type weights for all types will be set to the same value, making votes for all gauge types have the same relative weight. veBAL holders will need to vote for the veBAL gauge in order for it to receive tokens.\n\nThe coordinator will also set the gauge type weight for the Liquidity Mining Commmittee type to 0 and kill the gauge.\n\n### Option 2\n\nThe coordinator will mint the missing 98.6k BAL meant for veBAL holders, as well as Polygon and Arbitrum LPs. These tokens will be sent to the recipient contracts of the gauges, resulting in the same outcome as if the gauges had minted the tokens. \n\nAdditionally, it will mint all unminted BAL tokens that correspond to L1 LPs in order to airdrop them as part of the migration. Then, it will revoke minting permission from the current Balancer Minter contract, effectively disabling the Liquidity Mining program in its current configuration and preventing any further minting from the existing gauges.\n\nWith the old minter contract disabled, it will grant minting permissions to three new contracts: one that will always mint 10% of weekly emissions for veBAL holders, one that will always mint 10% of weekly emissions for the Liquidity Mining Committee (unless the community decides to not continue with this initiative), and one that will distribute the remaining percentage to liquidity gauges. A new GaugeController will be connected to this minter, meaning veBAL holders will need to recast their votes, and new liquidity gauges will in turn be connected to the GaugeController, meaning LPs will need to unstake from the old gauges and stake in the new one (this gas cost would be later reimbursed).\n\nThe coordinator will also set the gauge type weight for the Liquidity Mining Commmittee type to 0 and kill the gauge.\n\n## Keeping promises\n\nLiquidity providers on Polygon and Arbitrum have been expecting to receive 24650 BAL and 10150 BAL per week for liquidity provided between April 4 and April 17. Similarly, veBAL holders have been expecting 14500 BAL per week starting on April 7.\n\nUntil this proposal has been discussed and voted on, those amounts would be honored. Governance would mint 98.6k BAL to be retroactively distributed to veBAL holders and liquidity providers on Polygon and Arbitrum, covering the period between April 4th and April 21st.\n\nNo minting would be required to cover the Liquidity Mining Committee's share of emissions for the week between April 7 and April 13, as no commitments were made regarding distributions for that week. If needed, 14.5k BAL could be minted if there's a need to allocate BAL through the committee for the week between April 14 and April 20, but given that a gauge migration is one of the possible outcomes of this proposal it would be best to avoid allocating additional reward tokens to the existing gauges.\n\n## References\n\n[1] [Introducing veBAL Tokenomics](https://snapshot.org/#/balancer.eth/proposal/0x9fe19c491cf90ed2e3ed9c15761c43d39fd1fb732a940aba8058ff69787ee90a)",

Therefore, later on, an authorized party can withdraw and distribute them as bribes, to the DAO and to veBAL holders. The goal is to ensure that protocol fee collecting process is fully trustless and automated.\n\n---\n\n# 1. About Mimic\n\nMimic is a platform that allows you to deploy tailored infrastructure to automate (and/or delegate) access to DeFi, in a secure and 100% non-custodial way. Mimic is especially suitable to replace and speed up manual and centralized tasks while tracking and monitoring every detail. This is achieved through our innovative **Smart Vaults** concept: an automated and trustless solution that can be customized to suit your operation needs.\n\nDeploying a Smart Vault is simple. We only need to figure out the best configuration that suits your needs and customize one for you. Moreover, Mimic provides you with lots of multi-layer flexibility, it can be easily scaled up by deploying and connecting additional Smart Vaults.\n\n \n![smartValut.jpeg](ipfs://bafkreigf4kq2llrgqfetotcgcojmfigz646vhumbiox6sa7g6tesj6obly)\n    \n\nOur team members have a large experience in blockchain and especially in DeFi protocols. We have previously worked for many well-known projects like Aave, Balancer, Open Zeppelin, Aragon, POAP and The Graph.\n\n# 2. Background\n\nCurrently Balancer DAO collects protocol fees in three layers: Mainnet, Polygon and Arbitrum:\n\nMainnet: 0xce88686553686DA562CE7Cea497CE749DA109f9F\n\nPolygon: 0xce88686553686DA562CE7Cea497CE749DA109f9F\n\nArbitrum: 0xce88686553686DA562CE7Cea497CE749DA109f9F\n\nAs documented in [[BIP-19] Incentivize Core Pools & L2 Usage](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-19-incentivize-core-pools-l2-usage/3329):\n\n- All fees earned on Polygon & Arbitrum are used as bribes for core pools on those networks, weighted proportionally by TVL of those core pools - after the DAO takes its 25%.\n- All fees earned by Ethereum core pools are used as bribes on those pools (each pool gets its own fees as a bribe), after the DAO takes its 25%.\n- All fees earned by Ethereum non-core pools are sent to veBAL and the DAO (75/25 split).\n- Protocol fee collection, distribution, and any subsequent bribing take place every two weeks on Monday instead of weekly on Wednesday.\n- All fees earned are converted to USDC, except BAL and BAL-like assets which are converted to BAL\n- All bribes are paid in USDC\n\n# 3. Core Proposal\n\nOur proposal is to provide Balancer DAO with a **solution to automate** how it collects and distributes its protocol fees. To accomplished this, Mimic will deploy three customized Smart Vaults owned by Balancer DAO, one on each layer.\n\nAll Smart Vaults will only be allowed to collect earned fees when they reach a pre-determined value in USDC. If fees collected are BAL-like assets they will be converted to BAL, otherwise they will be converted to USDC. Both Polygon and Arbitrum Smart Vaults will bridge all USDC and BAL accumulated to the Mainnet Smart Vault every two weeks (one period).\n\nFinally, an authorized manager can withdraw those collected tokens from Mainnet Smart Vault to distribute them accordingly as bribes, to the DAO and to veBAL holders.\n\nAlso, it is important to mention that at all times the DAO has full ownership and control of all three Smart Vault’s assets. This means that, for example, at any moment it can remove permissions to execute an action or withdraw any asset by itself.\n\n# 4. Technical Specification\n\nThere will be three Smart Vaults. One deployed in Mainnet, another in Polygon and the last one in Arbitrum. All Smart Vaults will have a single owner who has full control over them at all times. \n\nEach Smart Vault will be configured with a series of predefined actions, some of those will be automatically executed by Mimic network of bots and others manually by an authorized manager that Balancer DAO designates. Those actions are:\n\n- **Gather and convert to USDC:** Gathers assets (expect from BAL and BAL-like assets) from Balancer ProtocolFeesCollector and swaps them to USDC (except from USDC itself).\n- **Gather and convert to BAL:** Gathers BAL and BAL-like assets from Balancer ProtocolFeesCollector and swaps them to BAL (except from BAL itself).\n- **Bridge:** Bridges USDC and BAL to Mainnet every two weeks.\n- **Withdraw:** Withdraws any asset to an external wallet configured by the owner.\n\nNote that all this behavior will be enforced by smart contracts code, actions won’t be allowed to perform any further logic.\n\nIn case external conditions change, the deployed infrastructure can be adjusted as necessary on an ongoing basis to reach the endowment’s objectives. Smart Vaults provide full flexibility to add new allow-listed actions, change permissions or incorporate new strategies. \n\nMore information here: [https://docs.mimic.fi/general/how-it-works](https://docs.mimic.fi/general/how-it-works)\n\n# 5. Operational details\n\n## 5.1. Reporting\n\nMimic offers a reporting site where users can follow all their Smart Vaults activity. Mimic also supports subscribing to a notifications service that can be easily integrated with some chat rooms like Discord. Additionally, users can subscribe to be notified with periodic reports that will be emitted by Mimic automatically. \n\n## 5.2. Maintenance\n\nMimic will be in charge of monitoring the Smart Vaults on a daily basis, making sure the reporting tools are kept up-to-date accordingly. Additionally, Mimic will make use of its own bots infrastructure to execute the automated actions when needed. \n\nIn case a critical report is received, Mimic will act immediately in order to assess its severity and act accordingly. In case Smart Vaults assets are at risk, Mimic team will get in touch with the trusted committee either to pause the Smart Vaults operations until it can be migrated to a new implementation with the corresponding fixes.\n\n## 5.3. Fees\n\nMimic will charge a 2% fee of the assets that are processed through the Smart Vaults with a 5K USD cap for every period of execution (two weeks).\n\n## 5.4. Termination\n\nAs mentioned before Balancer DAO will be in full control of its Smart Vaults and the funds that were deposited into them. This means Balancer DAO is allowed to exit at any point in time. Neither Mimic nor anyone else, unless it was previously allowed by the Balancer DAO, will be never in control of those funds.\n\n# 6. Timeline\n\nOnce the final details of the Balancer Smart Vaults are finalized, the Mimic team will take full responsibility to set up the required automated actions. Mimic already counts with infrastructure to deploy and test Smart Vaults that can be applied for this use case.\n\nAssuming the proposed investment strategies and automated actions are accepted by Balancer DAO, setting three Smart Vaults for it shouldn’t take longer than a month. After that, we will schedule an audit process for the configuration before the deployment which shouldn’t take more than two weeks. \n\n# 7.

        "author": "0x512fce9B07Ce64590849115EE6B32fd40eC0f5F3",
        "body": "This proposal appears on [Balancer's forum](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/introducing-vebal-tokenomics/2512).\n\n## Summary\n\nBAL is a governance token that has been successfully used to define important parameters of the Balancer ecosystem. The community believes that there is further room for improving the tokenomics of BAL and some sort of staking/locking should be implemented. Staking of BPT has already been proposed and approved by the community in the past[[1]](https://vote.balancer.fi/#/proposal/Qmcyn5zdoGQs8nbo1nFroZiG2jWb8UEFPH9Y18cga3ESCJ). The current proposal contains details of a concrete implementation of locking BPT. \n\nTo avoid reinventing the wheel and spending additional time with non-core development, Curve's tokenomics[[2]](https://curve.readthedocs.io/dao-vecrv.html) seems an obvious fit for Balancer Protocol as well. It has been battle-tested with billions of dollars and attracted a thriving ecosystem around it. \n\n## **Core proposal**\n\nCurve's ve (vote-escrowed) system will be used as an all-around solution for Balancer protocol tokenomics, solving at once a few outstanding problems the Balancer ecosystem currently has:\n\n- BAL minting is not automated and the inflation schedule is not yet locked forever. This reduces predictability and trust in the overall system.\n- BAL holders do not have any direct power over how BAL liquidity mining gets distributed.\n- Lack of a mechanism for distribution of protocol level fees, which have recently been approved by governance[[3]](https://vote.balancer.fi/#/proposal/0xf6238d70f45f4dacfc39dd6c2d15d2505339b487bbfe014457eba1d7e4d603e3).\n\nInstead of pure BAL, BPT of the 80/20 BAL/ETH pool[[4]](https://app.balancer.fi/#/pool/0x5c6ee304399dbdb9c8ef030ab642b10820db8f56000200000000000000000014) will be locked into veBAL, similar to how CRV can be locked into veCRV. This has the big advantage of keeping BAL liquid as well as setting a precedent for other teams to do the same with their 80/20 Balancer pools. Alternatives to veBAL have been considered, like vebptBAL. The simplicity of veBAL — even though what is locked is not pure BAL — has however been the preferred option.\n\n### veBAL and governance power\n\nAll votes, onchain or on snapshot, will be done considering veBAL balances instead of BAL balances as happens today. This ensures long-term alignment as only users locking BPT will have a say in Balancer's governance.\n\nTo get veBAL, anyone will be able to lock BPT of the 80/20 BAL/ETH pool for any amount of time between 1 week and 1 year. Notice this is a change from the max duration of 4 years initially proposed in [[1]](https://vote.balancer.fi/#/proposal/Qmcyn5zdoGQs8nbo1nFroZiG2jWb8UEFPH9Y18cga3ESCJ). This is proposed to allow for an eventual migration to a new governance system with a wait time of 1 year instead of 4. Of course this migration can only happen if the veBAL governance approves it.\n\nAfter locking the 80/20 BAL/ETH BPT, the user will have a non-zero balance of veBAL and will be able to help govern Balancer protocol, also benefiting from other parts of the new tokenomics system as described in more detail below.\n\n### New proposed BAL inflation schedule\n\nThe current BAL supply today (as of Jan 27th) is **47,470,000 BAL**. This includes BAL that is being vested by early stakeholders, the fundraising fund and the ecosystem fund. Please refer to the BAL launch medium post[[5]](https://medium.com/balancer-protocol/bal-is-live-104ba56e1945) for more details. \n\nSince the launch of BAL, the inflation has been a constant 145,000 BAL per week. To change that and make the Balancer ecosystem more sustainable, a new inflation schedule is proposed. Every 4 years the inflation should be halved, with gradual steps every year starting one year after the launch of the new tokenomics system. This would mean a final BAL supply of about **94,000,000 BAL.** A more detailed calculation can be seen on this public spreadsheet[[6]](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FY0gi596YWBOTeu_mrxhWcdF74SwKMNhmu0qJVgs0KI/edit?usp=sharing).\n\nThis new inflation schedule will be immutable.\n\n### Onchain Gauge System to determine Liquidity Mining distribution\n\nCurrently, liquidity mining is done via a tier system approved by the community[[7]](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/proposal-balancer-v2-liquidity-mining-program/1678). The distribution is fixed for tier 1 slots (it can only be changed via governance vote) totaling 60k BAL. The remaining slots are allocated by the Liquidity Mining committee, which is part of the Partnerships subDAO[[8]](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/draft-proposal-balancer-subdaos-formation/2428). BAL token holders have no direct say in which pools receive BAL from liquidity mining.\n\nIn the new system, however, all liquidity mining BAL minted will be distributed through the gauge system. Gauges are contracts that allow LPs (liquidity providers) to stake their BPT (Balancer Pool Token) and periodically claim BAL from liquidity mining. \n\nThe amount received by each LP will depend on:\n\n- how much the pool they are providing liquidity to receives\n- what share of the pool's liquidity they have\n- the boost applied to their LP share based on how much veBAL they hold[[9]](https://resources.curve.fi/guides/boosting-your-crv-rewards#formula)\n\nEach pool receives a share of the total BAL minted every week. That share is defined by how much veBAL voted for that pool.\n\n### Gauge types\n\nThere are different gauge types that are used in the ve system, each type gets a fixed percentage of the BAL supply minted weekly. Within each gauge type there can be many gauges that share the amount of BAL sent to that gauge type. The following gauge types and weights are proposed:\n\n1. Liquidity Mining committee: 10% (14,500 BAL)\n2. veBAL: 10% (14,500 BAL)\n3. Ethereum mainnet pools: 56% (81,200 BAL)\n4. Polygon pools: 17% (24,650 BAL)\n5. Arbitrum pools: 7% (10,150 BAL)\n\nNew gauge types can be added and the weights/percentages of all gauge types can be changed by governance. These changes are however not expected to happen frequently. \n\nGauge type 1) is an allowance for the Liquidity Mining committee to grant LM to strategic partnerships for Balancer protocol with the expectation that long term these partners will accrue veBAL to ensure they get LM through their own gauge. The LM committee should not accumulate BAL, that is, it commits to sending any unused BAL for any given week to the DAO treasury (not later than 7 days from receiving it).\n\nGauge type 2) is BAL that will be distributed to veBAL holders, similarly to LM that is distributed today to LPs of the 80/20 BAL/ETH pool. It is meant to keep locking 80/20 BPT attractive as it helps veBAL holders avoid dilution and compensates for the impermanent loss risk of LPing. \n\nGauges 3, 4 and 5 will be LM that is distributed to mainnet, Polygon and Arbitrum according to the veBAL voting power each pool gauge receives from veBAL holders.\n\n### Initial gauges\n\nIn order to avoid the governance overhead of voting on adding dozens of initial gauges, all pools that will be receiving liquidity mining at the moment of system activation will be allowlisted. This however does NOT mean that they will have an initial percentage of LM. This will be defined by veBAL voting power.\n\n### Protocol revenue distribution\n\n75% of protocol revenues collected by the protocol fee collector[[10]](https://docs.balancer.fi/getting-started/faqs/fees) will be distributed to veBAL holders. The other 25% of the fees will be kept by the DAO treasury as a reserve. This has been suggested by many thought leaders like Hasu, on his New Mental Model for DeFi Treasuries[[11]](https://uncommoncore.co/a-new-mental-model-for-defi-treasuries/). \n\nGiven Balancer protocol is permissionless and meant to have thousands of pools, fees are going to be collected in potentially thousands of different tokens. Some type of consolidation will be necessary for the fees to be claimable by veBAL holders in a meaningful, gas-efficient way. The fee consolidation prior to distribution will initially be handled by the treasury subDAO, but should be replaced in the near future by a fully decentralized smart contract implementation, akin to Curve's burner contracts[[12]](https://curve.readthedocs.io/dao-fees.html).\n\n### Upgrading the system\n\nLike with Curve, the system will not be upgradeable. In case the veBAL governance decides for a new system, the way to implement it would be to abandon the current system and direct minted BAL to the new system. This can only be done with a 1-year time delay, which ensures that anyone locking BPT for the longest duration possible will have the opportunity to withdraw their BPT before the minter points elsewhere.\n\nThe inflation schedule however will NOT be upgradeable and will be fixed forever.\n\n### Benefits\n\nBeyond increasing the overall predictability of Balancer Protocol and the BAL governance token as mentioned above, there are many other benefits worth mentioning: \n\n- **Long-term alignment.** By locking BPT, token holders will be encouraged to support Balancer over the long-term instead of speculating short-term.\n- **Plug&play compatibility with Curve's ecosystem.** Curve has achieved tremendous success with a thriving ecosystem built around their ve tokenomics. By using the same system we make it trivial for teams like Yearn, Element, Convex and so many others to become part of Balancer's ecosystem too.\n- **Developer time/effort saved for core Balancer work.** Tokenomics is super important but it is not what makes Balancer (or any other protocol for that matter) unique: precious development time should be focused on pool primitives and making Balancer easier to integrate with. Only this will help Balancer achieve the vision of becoming the leading liquidity platform for others to build on top.\n- **Motivation for other DAOs to take a position in Balancer beyond just token-swaps.** It has become common for DAOs and protocols to purchase CRV in the open market to make sure they have a say in the Curve Wars. By having protocols aligned with Balancer longer term we expect utility and usage of Balancer to increase as well.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\n- Launching our own staking contracts (which are ready and audited but don't solve all the problems that this proposal does).\n- Using mStable rewards distributor or a variation of it.\n- Keeping status-quo.\n\n## **Risk assessment/mitigation**\n\n1. **Immutability of the system will likely be a problem at some point in the distant future:** It's impossible to be at the same time predictable and upgradeable, so the trade-off chosen was that the system itself cannot be changed, but veBAL governance can choose to direct BAL inflation to a new system with a minimum 1-year delay. This is not expected to happen any time soon, but as things change hyper fast in this space, this system will likely not be the best option in say 5 years from now.\n2. **Platforms built on top (like Convex on Curve) can take over control with central points of failure.** We expect veBAL governance to consider single point of failures for projects that apply to have their smart contracts be allowlisted for locking BPT. Ideally only projects which let token holders vote directly with their voting power (instead of delegating all their power to a multisig) will be approved.  \n\n## Implementation\n\nThe main goal of the implementation is to change as little as possible from the battle-tested original Curve implementation. There could be some minor necessary technical changes that are necessary to adapt it to Balancer. The essence of this proposal or the parameters laid out however should not be changed.\n\n## **Voting**\n\nThis proposal will be posted on the forum for 1 week prior to voting. Voting will then be open on Snapshot for three days. This vote will be a single choice vote. You may vote on the Proposal by selecting “Yes, let's do it” or “No, this is not the way”.\n\nThanks to everyone who contributed with feedback and suggestions, also thank you to Curve for having created this great tokenomics system and also to the Yearn community[[13]](https://gov.yearn.finance/t/yip-65-evolving-yfi-tokenomics/11994) for inspiration for this proposal!\n\nI'm curious to hear everyone's thoughts and if you think anything proposed can be improved.\n\nReferences:\n\n1.
