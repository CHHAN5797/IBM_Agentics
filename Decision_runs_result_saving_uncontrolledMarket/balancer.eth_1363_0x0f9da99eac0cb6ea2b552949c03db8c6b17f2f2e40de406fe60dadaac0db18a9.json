E-CLPs are custom pools from Gyroscope built on top of Balancer’s pool architecture. They enable trading along the curve of an ellipse. This pool type is ideally suited for stablecoins and liquid staking tokens; it is typically more capital efficient and could thus generate significant trading volume.\n* The pool shall has a swap fee of 4 basis points, i.e., 0.04% at pool inception. The fee split is as follows: 50% of all collected fees will go to liquidity providers, while the remaining 50% will go towards Balancer. At pool inception, no fees will go towards Gyroscope.\n\n# References/Useful links\n\n* [Slidedeck on E-CLPs](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/16Qt-8PaLJ_1FkaNnI4rocEYUDrG1ktW3u4R6yeSwY68/edit#slide=id.g208e5b00ffd_0_95)\n* [Documentation of E-CLPs](https://docs.gyro.finance/gyroscope-protocol/concentrated-liquidity-pools/e-clps#description-of-e-clps)\n* [Website](https://gyro.finance/)\n* [Github](https://github.com/gyrostable)\n* [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/2vnqnS7wE6)\n* [X](https://twitter.com/GyroStable)\n\n**Protocol Description:**\n\n> pxETH is a liquid and fungible receipt token for ETH deposited into the Dinero protocol. pxETH is built on top of the Redacted DAO's Pirex platform and forms an integral part of Redacted’s Dinero protocol, a protocol which aims to vertically integrate ETH staking, block proposal and building, a RPC, leverage, and yield stripping into one synergistic ecosystem comprising pxETH, the Redacted Relayer RPC, and the DINERO stablecoin. pxETH provides users with a liquid and fungible tokenized staked ETH which benefits from Ethereum staking rewards and other revenue forms such as MEV tips and block rewards. Future pxETH yield and pxETH withdrawals can be tokenized and used within DeFi. Further details about pxETH can be found in the whitepaper [here](https://github.com/redacted-cartel/pirex-eth-whitepaper/blob/master/pxETH_whitepaper.pdf).\n\nIn addition to the DEX liquidity for pxETH incentivized by Redacted DAO, the Dinero protocol has additional mechanisms to improve pxETH liquidity and support the pxETH:ETH peg in both normal and adverse market conditions allowing for greater pxETH DeFi composability.\n\npxETH can be redeemed for ETH from the Dinero protocol either instantaneously for ETH which has yet to be staked or via ETH which is unstaked from validators. In the future a novel incentivized withdrawal pool will facilitate quicker pxETH withdrawals when there is an ETH unstaking queue and/or adverse market conditions.\n\nThe governance token for pxETH is BTRFLY.\n\n**Motivation:**\n\n> Redacted has a long and close relationship with Balancer and Aura. Because of this close relationship and Redacted’s vlAURA governance power, we want to have Balancer as the one of our primary venues for crucial pxETH liquidity.\n\nAn LST is only as good as its peg. Therefore for pxETH to be successful, significant liquidity is required. With a gauge, Redacted plans to use its governance power and bribes to direct emissions to the gauge and incentivize crucial pxETH liquidity on Balancer, allowing for higher volumes in the LP and also generating fees for veBAL holders.\n\nBy using E-CLPs a comparably small amount of initial capital can provide a disproportionately deep market for GYD. The E-CLP’s efficiency gains are possible due to:\n\n* Customizable liquidity profiles: Using the curve of an ellipse enables highly customizable liquidity profiles. E-CLPs can be calibrated to approximate most trading curves that would be desired. E-CLP curves can be tailored to have certain regions of low price impact and other regions of high price impact.\n\n* Price bounds: The E-CLP concentrates liquidity within price-bounds that enable the E-CLP to be highly capital-efficient. Functionally, this works by enabling arbitrary truncation of liquidity profiles from a given trading curve. In effect, the capital efficiency comes from bounding the trading curve to an expected trading range of the assets.\n\nSeveral E-CLPs have already been deployed to provide custom tailored liquidity profiles for LSTs and stablecoins. For an overview of previously deployed E-CLPs consult: https://dune.com/gyro_finance/gyroscope-e-clps 1\n\n# Specifications\n\n## Governance\n\nThe Gyroscope Protocol will be governed by a DAO and relevant stakeholder with the full launch on Ethereum. For now, the FTL Labs multi-sig can pause the pool, change the swap fee and set the protocol fee. As a custom pool by Gyroscope, the E-CLP will be controlled by Gyroscope governance upon its launch.\n\n## Oracles\n\nNo oracles are currently used.\n\n## Audits\n\nAudit reports by Nethermind, Trail of Bits, and Runtime Verification can be accessed here (the E-CLP is called the “CEMM” in these reports). In addition, the E-CLP code has been live in production on Polygon since November 2022.\n\n## Centralization vectors\n\nNo centralization vectors. The FTL Labs team’s multi-sig can - currently - pause the pool, change the swap fee and set the protocol fee.\n\n## Market History\n\nThe Gyroscope Protocol is live on Ethereum since EOY23, with E-CLPs on several other chains. Details available[ here 1](https://dune.com/gyro_finance/gyroscope-e-clps).\n\n## Value\n\nAs per “Motivation”.\n\n## Contracts\n\n* [pxETH/frxETH E-CLP](https://etherscan.io/address/0x767cb26e38bebddfd857d4ad426d8ff5bc0fac2f)\n* Ethereum [gauge](https://etherscan.io/address/0x21693d09df79D4297A1ED9622Fb1D2E4Eeec5BC5)\n\n### Specification\n\nTransaction: The Balancer Maxi LM Multisig `eth:0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd` and call the `addGauge` function with the following arguments:\n\ngauge(address): `0x21693d09df79D4297A1ED9622Fb1D2E4Eeec5BC5`\n\ngaugeType(string): `Ethereum`",

E-CLPs are custom pools from Gyroscope built on top of Balancer’s pool architecture. They enable trading along the curve of an ellipse. This pool type is ideally suited for stablecoins and liquid staking tokens; it is typically more capital efficient and could thus generate significant trading volume.\n> * **The pool shall has a swap fee of 1 basis points, i.e., 0.01% at pool inception.** The fee split is as follows: 50% of all collected fees will go to liquidity providers, while the remaining 50% will go towards Balancer. At pool inception, no fees will go towards Gyroscope.\n\n> # References/Useful links\n>\n>\n>\n> * [Slidedeck on E-CLPs](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1IAVN7mDiPt4teeuBUMqi0KJdZ2aiRWwGAxRhJU75TB4/edit?usp=sharing)\n> * [Documentation of E-CLPs](https://docs.gyro.finance/gyroscope-protocol/concentrated-liquidity-pools/e-clps#description-of-e-clps)\n> * [Website](https://gyro.finance/)\n> * [Github](https://github.com/gyrostable)\n> * [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/2vnqnS7wE6)\n> * [X](https://twitter.com/GyroStable)\n\n> # Protocol description\n>\n>\n>\n> * Staked FRAX (sFRAX) is an ERC4626 staking vault that distributes part of the Frax Protocol yield weekly to stakers denominated in FRAX stablecoins. The sFRAX token represents pro rata deposits within the vault and is always withdrawable for FRAX stablecoins at the pro rata rate at all times. - [Frax ](https://docs.frax.finance/frax-v3/sfrax)\n> * Frax Finance is a decentralized lending platform which issues the FRAX stablecoin. Frax Finance algorithmically sustains the value of FRAX through the use of fractional collateral reserves. The collateral used on Frax Finance is split between an accepted collateral (e.g. ether) and Frax Finance’s governance token, FXS. The collateralization ratio for FRAX changes based on its price. - [Gemini](https://www.gemini.com/pt-BR/prices/Frax?timestamp=1705682853673)\n\n> # Motivation\n>\n>\n>\n> By using E-CLPs a comparably small amount of initial capital can provide a disproportionately deep market for GYD. The E-CLP’s efficiency gains are possible due to:\n>\n>\n>\n> * **Customizable liquidity profiles**: Using the curve of an ellipse enables highly customizable liquidity profiles. E-CLPs can be calibrated to approximate most trading curves that would be desired. E-CLP curves can be tailored to have certain regions of low price impact and other regions of high price impact.\n> * **Price bounds**: The E-CLP concentrates liquidity within price-bounds that enable the E-CLP to be highly capital-efficient. Functionally, this works by enabling arbitrary truncation of liquidity profiles from a given trading curve. In effect, the capital efficiency comes from bounding the trading curve to an expected trading range of the assets.\n>\n>\n>\n> Several E-CLPs have already been deployed to provide custom tailored liquidity profiles for LSTs and stablecoins.

        "body": "### PR with Payload\nhttps://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/585\n\n# Proposal by Gyroscope\n\n> ## Summary\n> \n> * **This is a proposal to enable a Balancer gauge for a rETH/WETH pool on Balancer Polygon zkEVM.**\n> * **The pool is an Elliptic Concentrated Liquidity Pool (E-CLP).** E-CLPs are custom pools from Gyroscope built on top of Balancer’s pool architecture. They enable trading along the curve of an ellipse. This pool type is ideally suited for liquid staking tokens, is typically more capital efficient and could thus generate significant trading volume.\n> * T**he pool shall be a ‘Core’ pool with a swap fee of 1 basis points, i.e., 0.01% at pool inception.** The fee split is as follows: 50% of all collected fees will go to liquidity providers, while the remaining 50% will go towards Balancer. At pool inception, no fees will go towards Gyroscope. As a Core pool it will be eligible for fee recycling.\n\n> ## References/Useful links\n> \n> * [Slidedeck on E-CLPs ](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/16Qt-8PaLJ_1FkaNnI4rocEYUDrG1ktW3u4R6yeSwY68/edit#slide=id.g208e5b00ffd_0_95)\n> * [Documentation of E-CLPs ](https://docs.gyro.finance/gyroscope-protocol/concentrated-liquidity-pools/e-clps#description-of-e-clps)\n> * [Website ](https://gyro.finance/)\n> * [Github](https://github.com/gyrostable)\n> * [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/2vnqnS7wE6)\n\n> ## Protocol description\n> \n> * [When staking ETH with RocketPool] you will be given a token called rETH. rETH represents both how much ETH you deposited, and when you deposited it. The ratio includes rewards that Rocket Pool node operators earn from: The Beacon Chain itself, Priority fees from block proposals, and MEV rewards from block proposals. - [RocketPool](https://docs.rocketpool.net/guides/staking/overview.html#the-reth-token)\n> * WETH is a wrapper-token and an ERC-20 token representing ETH at a 1:1 ratio.\n> * The E-CLP uses an internal conversion to avoid a unit drift of yield-accruing tokens.\n\n> ## Motivation\n> \n> **We expect the E-CLP to improve capital efficiency significantly.** The E-CLP’s efficiency gains are possible due to:\n> \n> * **Customizable liquidity profiles:** Using the curve of an ellipse enables highly customizable liquidity profiles. E-CLPs can be calibrated to approximate most trading curves that would be desired. E-CLP curves can be tailored to have certain regions of low price impact and other regions of high price impact.\n> * **Price bounds:** The E-CLP concentrates liquidity within price-bounds that enable the E-CLP to be highly capital-efficient. Functionally, this works by enabling arbitrary truncation of liquidity profiles from a given trading curve. In effect, the capital efficiency comes from bounding the trading curve to an expected trading range of the assets.\n> \n> **For an overview of previously deployed E-CLPs view**: https://dune.com/gyro_finance/gyroscope-e-clps\n> \n> E-CLPs have been developed for stablecoin pools that include the upcoming Gyroscope stablecoin, GYD. However, they can find broader application, whenever the expected trading range of the included assets can be informed by external business logic (e.g. from arbitrage loops of mints/ redemptions in the case of LSTs). \n\n## Specifications\n\n> ### Governance\n> \n> The Gyroscope Protocol is in limited production live on Polygon. The Gyroscope Protocol will be governed by a DAO and relevant stakeholder with the full launch on Ethereum. For now, the FTL Labs multi-sig can pause the pool, change the swap fee and set the protocol fee. As a custom pool by Gyroscope, the E-CLP will be controlled by Gyroscope governance upon its launch.\n\n> ### Oracles\n> \n> * rateProvider0 (for WETH): 0x00\n> * rateProvider1 (for rETH): [0x60b39bec6af8206d1e6e8dfc63cea214a506d6c3](https://zkevm.polygonscan.com/address/0x60b39bec6af8206d1e6e8dfc63cea214a506d6c3#readContract)\n> * (allows to control for a price drift from accruing yield by using rate providers to first convert from yield accruing tokens to the underlying)\n\n> ### Audits\n> \n> Audit reports by Nethermind, Trail of Bits, and Runtime Verification can be accessed here (the E-CLP is called the “CEMM” in these reports). In addition, the E-CLP code has been live in production on Polygon since November 2022.\n\n> ### Centralization vectors\n> \n> No centralization vectors. The FTL Labs team’s multi-sig can - currently - pause the pool, change the swap fee and set the protocol fee.\n\n> ### Market History\n> \n> C.f. contracts.\n\n> ### Value\n> \n> As per “Motivation”. Other zkEVM pools with these assets exist, but none of them feature asymmetrically concentrated liquidity. Asymmetric concentrated liquidity for these assets could become a substantial driver of trading volume and total value locked.\n\n> ## Contracts\n> \n> * wstETH/cbETH E-CLP: [0xb1557CFEA06De5a1601a7F0cCF3b515EF431A50d](https://zkevm.polygonscan.com/address/0xb1557cfea06de5a1601a7f0ccf3b515ef431a50d)\n> * zkEVM gauge: [0xEdEa3E93b914E2654F8c7e0C2bb5E6205f9742b0](https://zkevm.polygonscan.com/address/0xedea3e93b914e2654f8c7e0c2bb5e6205f9742b0)\n> * Mainnet gauge: [0x42a3290a65CA16Adaf161c6FfAfDBE0913A169F4](https://etherscan.io/address/0x42a3290a65CA16Adaf161c6FfAfDBE0913A169F4)\n\nSpecifcation:\n\nThe Balancer Maxi LM Multisig eth:`0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd` and call the addGauge function with the following arguments:\ngauge(address):`0x42a3290a65CA16Adaf161c6FfAfDBE0913A169F4`\ngaugeType(string): `PolygonZkEvm`",

    "ai_final_reason": "- Timeline voting metrics show unanimous, stable support for enabling the gauge, indicating strong community backing among voters.\n- Historical similar proposals (BIP-577, BIP-576) to enable gauges for related pools also passed unanimously and reinforced the utility of such incentives.\n- Market data shows positive token price and TVL impact around the proposal timeframe, suggesting beneficial effects on liquidity and value.\n- Forum sentiment is slightly negative due to a critical comment but overall limited discussion; the recommendation aligns with voter sentiment and aims for long-term protocol health.\n- Risks around centralization and lack of oracles are noted but outweighed by the benefits of increased liquidity and emission incentives.\n- Therefore, the recommendation supports changing the status quo to enable the gauge for pxETH/WETH.",
