        "body": "**Title:** [ARFC] Upgrade Safety Module with StkGHO\n\n**Author:** Marc Zeller - ACI (Aave Chan Initiative)\n\n**Date:** 2023-11-21\n\n---\n\n## Summary\nThis ARFC introduces an enhancement to the Safety Module by integrating a GHO Safety Module. This new category aims to mitigate risks using GHO’s stablecoin attributes for potential shortfall events within its ecosystem. It also reduces the Safety incentives for StkAAVE and StkBPT.\n\n## Motivation\n\n[AIP-366 was adopted by governance](https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/366/) to reduce the safety incentives of StkAAVE and StkBPT, but an implementation bug made the AIP execution impossible. After discussion with DAO service providers, it was decided to bundle the re-run of 366 with the creation of the GHO safety module and the StkGHO asset.\n\nThe GHO Safety Module will fortify the Aave Protocol's resilience by adding a stablecoin asset, which is inherently less volatile than AAVE. This strategic move diversifies the Safety Module's capacity to absorb shocks from various risk vectors in case of shortfall events.\n\nThe GHO Safety Module will target a liquidity pool of 9M GHO with an APR range of 12-15%, achievable with a daily emission of 35 AAVE/day over a 90-day period. The module will have a slashing rate set at 100%, meaning the entirety of the deposits could be utilized in a shortfall event, with socialized coverage among StkGHO holders. The cooldown period is adjusted to 10 days, which is suitable for a stablecoin.\n\n## Specification\n**Revised Safety Module Emissions Rate:**\n\n| Asset      | Previous Emissions | Proposed Emissions |\n|------------|-------------------|--------------------|\n| StkAAVE    | 550 AAVE/day      | 385 AAVE/day       |\n| StkBPT     | 550 AAVE/day      | 385 AAVE/day       |\n| StkGHO     | N/A               | 35 AAVE/day        |\n\n- **GHO Safety Module Parameters:**\n  - Target Liquidity: 9M GHO\n  - Target APR: 12-15%\n  - Emissions Period: 35 AAVE/day over a 90-day cycle\n  - Slashing Rate: 100%\n  - Cooldown Period: 10 days\n\n## Next Steps\n1. If the ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, proceed to the AIP stage.\n\n## Disclosure\nThe Aave-chan Initiative is not presenting this ARFC on behalf of any third party and has not been compensated for creating this ARFC.\n\n## Copyright\nCopyright and related rights waived under [Creative Commons Zero (CC0)](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

        "body": "---\nTitle: [ARFC] Framework for ARFC and TEMP CHECK Proposals\nAuthor: @MarcZeller - Aave Chan Initiative\nDate: 2023-06-27\n---\n\n## Summary\n\nThis framework provides comprehensive guidelines for the Aave DAO community when creating and voting on ARFC (Aave Request for Comment) and TEMP CHECK proposals. It includes a template for crafting proposals and outlines the quorum and voting requirements.\n\n## Motivation\n\n### Distinction Between TEMP CHECK and ARFC\n\nTEMP CHECKs serve as \"temperature checks\" to gauge community sentiment on a proposal or topic. They do not necessitate service provider involvement or a high level of precision or technicality.\n\nConversely, ARFCs are precursors to Aave Improvement Proposals (AIPs). Relevant service providers are formally invited to provide feedback on them, and the specification section of ARFCs should detail how the potential upcoming AIP will impact Aave protocol smart contracts.\n\n### Proposal Template\n\nEach proposal **must** include the following sections:\n\nA header:\n1. **Title**: A concise and descriptive title for the proposal, including the proposal type (ARFC or TEMP CHECK) in a [TAG] format.\n2. **Author**: The name of the author and/or entity creating the proposal.\n3. **Date**: The date the proposal is being made, in the YYYY-MM-DD format.\n\nA proposal body:\n\n1. **Summary**: A succinct summary of the proposal.\n2. **Motivation**: A detailed presentation of the proposal and potential benefits for the Aave protocol. This section can have sub-sections for improved readability.\n3. **Specification**: A comprehensive description of the proposed change, including any relevant parameters or risk considerations. For ARFCs, this section should be technical, detailing the specific changes to be made. This section can have sub-sections for improved readability.\n4. **Disclaimer**: Any necessary disclaimers, such as conflicts of interest or third-party involvement.\n5. **Next Steps**: The proposed next steps if the proposal is approved.\n6. **Copyright**: A statement defining proposal copyright. While Open-Source is **mandatory**, the choice of a specific license is left to the author.\n\n### Voting Guidelines\n\n1. **Vote Start Time**: The vote should commence 24 hours after the proposal is published on Snapshot.\n2. **Proposal Age**: The governance thread related to the snapshot vote should be at least 5 days old before voting begins.\n3. **Vote Duration**: The vote should last for a minimum of 3 days.\n4. **Vote Options**: The vote should have at least three options: YAE (Yes), NAY (No), and ABSTAIN.\n5. **Quorum**: The vote should reach a quorum of 320,000 YAE votes.\n6. **Differential**: The YAE votes should exceed the second-largest vote option (either NAY or ABSTAIN) by at least 80,000.\n\n### Proposal Cycle:\n\n![image|1920x920](upload://fPsMYVukUCZ2OFHwDUzkFUgc9dw.jpeg)\n\n### Special Considerations\n\nThis framework should be considered as a general template for general proposals.

Multiple bribe budgets and votes are submitted over the weekend and often members are traveling for conferences during this time.\n\nWith SolarCurve stepping down to focus on other initiatives, this publication proposes updating the SAFE signer requirement to 3 of 5. As an interim step, the SAFE has been temporarily transitioned to 3 of 5, to enable smoother processing of transactions. The ALC will soon consist of the following committee members:\n\n* @MatthewGraham - [TokenLogic](https://twitter.com/Token_Logic)\n* @Sisyphos - [karpatkey](https://twitter.com/karpatkey)\n* @Emilio - [Avara Labs](https://twitter.com/avara)\n* @MarcZeller - [ACI](https://twitter.com/AaveChan)\n* @Figue - [Paladin](https://twitter.com/Paladin_vote)\n\nWith Solarcurves departure, the ALC SAFE will become 3 of 5. This publication seeks approval from the DAO to keep in place the 3 signer requirement. \n\n# Specification\n\nALC SAFE: `0x205e795336610f5131Be52F09218AF19f0f3eC60`\n\nProposed Signer Configuration: 3 of 5\n\n# Next Steps\n\n1) Gather feedback from the community and risk service providers.\n2) If consensus is reached on this ARFC, escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n3) If Snapshot outcome is YAE, new threshold will be considered canon\n\n# Disclosure\n\nTokenLogic and karpatkey receive no payment for this proposal. TokenLogic and karpatkey are both delegates within the Aave community.\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)",
