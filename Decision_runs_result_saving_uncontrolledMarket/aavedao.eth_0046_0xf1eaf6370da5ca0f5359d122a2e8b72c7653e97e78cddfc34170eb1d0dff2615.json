        "body": "# Summary\n\nBuilding on the recent integration of [Aave Generalized Risk Stewards (AGRS)](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-aave-generalized-risk-stewards-agrs-activation/19178), this proposal introduces an automated Risk Oracle framework to enhance the efficiency of Supply and Borrow cap updates within the Aave Protocol. The framework is built around two core components: (1) algorithmic, simulation-based assessments continuously conducted to evaluate cap exposure across all markets, and (2) predefined cap utilization thresholds that trigger simulations to determine whether cap adjustments are necessary. Operating under stricter constraints than those currently permitted at the Risk Steward contract level, this system introduces no additional permissions while significantly improving the observability and responsiveness of risk management. The initial deployment is planned for Arbitrum to start, to be expanded to other chains in the future.\n\n# Motivation\n\n### Current Cap Update Process\n\nThe current implementation of the Risk Steward contract allows for the manual, periodic updating of Supply and Borrow caps, generally performed in response to market demand. Such an implementation allows for the risk/reward of respective asset exposure to be quantified and assessed in a much quicker fashion as opposed to the traditional governance mechanisms in place. This creates the ability to perform cap increases every three days by up to a 100% relative change, alongside functionality to react to adverse events or liquidity crunches through cap exposure decreases to any nominal value.\n\nWhile the implementation of the Risk Steward contract allows such risk configurations to be optimally managed in a more efficient manner, this manual integration creates significant operational overhead to maintain the state of relative demand across all Aave markets. This is currently performed through the following process:\n\n1. Manually identify a necessary cap assessment and potential alteration through internal alerting systems.\n2. Run internal supply and borrow cap risk simulations for the asset, determining the optimal increase or decrease with respect to the defined constraints at the Risk Steward level.\n3. Create a forum post outlining the imminent cap change(s) and the associated rationale for such increases through a risk report that references the state of the asset’s Aave market.\n4. Obtain the calldata and create a transaction for the cap change.\n5. Execute the cap change after a final security verification by BGD (2/2 Safe)\n\nThe high volume of updates, combined with the manual triggering of supply and borrow cap simulations, written analyses, and coordination across multiple service providers, often leads to delays in implementing cap increases. These delays can hinder potential growth opportunities for underlying assets that might otherwise contribute significantly. Additionally, the reliance on manual monitoring to address liquidity crunches for specific assets and chains adds further inefficiency. For context, since October 1, 2024, a total of 178 manual cap updates and 49 written analyses have been conducted across all instances.\n\n![image - 2025-02-03T010936.218.png](ipfs://bafkreibuloniitunlqaov72bnkc5oembjewu66dorrgnc26yzprj3hbgiu)\n### **Edge - Risk Oracle**\n\nThe Supply and Borrow Cap Risk Oracle automates the process of generating and applying cap recommendations for Aave, leveraging our underlying simulation engine being utilized today to perform manual cap changes through the Risk Steward. Depending on whether the cap utilization surpasses or falls below specific thresholds, either the cap increase or cap decrease simulation is triggered, in addition to the frequent time-based triggering of simulations for all respective markets. The simulation then determines the optimal new cap value based on a range of risk metrics. Once calculated, the updated cap is automatically published to the contract, where it is directly applied to the market, updating the cap value in real-time.\n\nThe following section provides a more detailed technical overview.\n\n- **Cap Increases**\n    - The risk oracle is triggered when the median cap utilization exceeds the defined utilization threshold for a full day.\n    - The simulation stress-tests larger supply and borrow caps, taking into account the current state of the protocol, user positions, and external factors such as liquidity availability on the chain and the general circulating supply.\n    - **Parameter Adjustments**:\n        - **Supply Cap**: Recommend a new supply cap, if the risk allows.\n        - **Borrow Cap**: Recommend a new borrow cap, constrained by its ratio to the current supply cap. If the current supply cap does not support an increase, a new supply cap will be recommended (if the risk allows) to support the new borrow cap.\n- **Cap Decreases**\n    - Decreasing cap exposure through the risk oracle is triggered with two different components of the model:\n        1. Dynamic decreases resulting from asset liquidity depreciation and/or an unhealthy set of positions within the market. The simulation stress-tests the current supply and borrow caps for all assets on a weekly cadence, taking into account the current state of the protocol, user positions, and external factors such as liquidity availability on the chain and the general circulating supply. If the current nominal cap value is deemed too risky, the simulation will determine the optimal decrease value as a function of the aforementioned components.\n        2. Deterministic decreases as a result of low cap utilization within a respective market when the monthly utilization falls below a specified threshold. To ensure a conservative approach, utilization must stay below these thresholds for at least 90% of the time. In such cases, the cap will be halved, leading to a maximum updated utilization of 50% for Supply Caps and 30% for Borrow Caps. The cap can only be reduced down to a fixed minimum value.\n    - **Parameter Adjustments**:\n        - **Supply Cap**: Recommend a new supply cap, depending on the associated risk defined in (1), and ensuring it can still support the current borrow cap in (2)\n        - **Borrow Cap**: Recommend a new borrow cap.\n- **Update Frequency**:\n    - Adjustments are made when utilization or the general market state requires it, with a minimum of 3 days between updates.\n- **Monitoring and Transparency:**\n    - All adjustments will be transparent and auditable, with data available for community review.\n\n### Risk Oracle Permissions\n\n- The risk steward contract currently enforces the following constraints:\n\n| **Parameter** | **Percent change allowed** | **minimumDelay** |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Supply Cap | +100% (increase) | 3 days |\n| Borrow Cap | +100% (increase) | 3 days |\n\nThe proposed modification to the current flow of cap updates automates the process of leveraging our currently manually utilized risk simulations to increase such caps. As such, in the proposed specification, the associated percent change allowed will be set at a more conservative +30%, with an equivalent minimum delay adhered to at the Risk Oracle level. All supply and borrow cap update events emitted can be observed in our Risk Oracle dashboard [here](https://edgebychaos.com/risk-feeds/aave). As this system will minimize the amount of manual overhead for each cap increase performed, we aim to provide periodic performance reports for the DAO.\n\nThrough the integration on Arbitrum, the following 15 markets fall under the specification:\n\n![image - 2025-02-03T010941.873.png](ipfs://bafkreieiddfslmk2up55jpwgvaxsv4zwnem3pimbv3pggsfxbi3c2jjnni)\n[Chaos Labs Arbitrum Risk Dashboard](https://community.chaoslabs.xyz/aave/risk/markets/Arbitrum-main/listed-assets)\n\n### Growth/Speculative Assets\n\nWhile the Risk Oracle is designed to establish a generalized system for automated cap increases within the proposed constraints, certain speculative, growth-oriented assets—such as ezETH on Arbitrum—cannot be standardized in this manner. These assets inherit external ad-hoc inputs, preferential considerations, and limiting risk configurations at the protocol level. As a result, the Risk Oracle will not be used to recommend cap increases for such assets. Instead, they will continue to be manually assessed using the existing method employed through the Risk Steward contract. Additionally, manual stewards will remain as a fallback mechanism when deemed necessary, ensuring continuity with the current implementation.",

        "body": "![Screenshot 2023-11-27 at 11.49.57](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rytN7ZMH6.png)\n\n# Summary\n\nThis publication introduces @TokenLogic and @Karpatkey as the DAO’s Financial Service Provider for an initial period of 180 days, with a proposed budget of 400k GHO. The scope of contribution will span the following areas of the DAO’s finances:\n\n* Treasury Management;\n* Strategic Assets’ Liquidity; and\n* Safety Module.\n\nThe combined karpatkey and TokenLogic team presents an unparalleled offering of specialized skills and proven technical expertise, with a network that spans most of DeFi.\n\n# Motivation\n\n## Treasury Management\n\nAave is the leading cross-chain lending protocol by all relevant KPIs i.e. TVL, supplied; and borrowed assets. With the latest version (v3) present on 10 networks, Aave Protocol currently generates revenue across ten networks and 18 deployments (v1, v2 incl. Centrifuge and ARC, v3 incl. Spark), consolidating a cross-chain treasury that’s currently worth around $130M.\n\n![|576x335](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/63TVEW32fnDI7_Dg3E5Mzw1XnQJd8284sa4VJ_XfrFWfVLsiEH4lX134c-X5StL4qo7L5QZOQaId-a8MQURHy2Ml3eeDfuSe8DdXRwDF-wK9cMJm26NLZjw9Ys6PZRYCT3YeUl7m49HJo_5C_tt9NeI \"Chart\")\n\nIn spite of having a significantly sized treasury, the Aave DAO faces mainly three challenges with its current treasury composition and operational practice.\n\n### Portfolio Volatility\n\nA significant portion of the treasury is held in the DAO’s native token (AAVE) which currently has limited DeFi utility and introduces volatility in the overall treasury value. The following chart illustrates the treasury allocation across various crypto assets.\n\n![|522x304](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/MAvZlV6jGMF6UfYcfO54H761nqHULxFYABWN0b-et8UjKGF1T9ZhzphJZqwlT6r8RcvQ2q9ovKLmLddvKRSiwwUhsAtlFoYpJCimdbzf6bUI0JkRsxkfed0HGSfwvh646x_mVaJlLVIA1Lc9ZltgwKA \"Chart\")\n\n### Asset Dispersion\n\nTreasury funds are dispersed around multiple collector contracts deployed in different blockchains. These funds are a direct result of how the protocol captures value and are mostly denominated in aTokens (~61) according to market activity, which requires constant rebalancing to meet expense requirements. This activity has historically been carried out through the governance processes, lacking comprehensive and up-to-date data on portfolio composition and rationale for asset allocation.![|688x384](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/TOGbL74wUrt6nMH83_jLP5kdJMQqX0Bnm4F0Qy3b605oaEz6z0xO1A3qw8ysj1hZdjzqm8MlSLP8hlesdTy3CegW3JEErznwfRdUX1YzgJS2ni8Cdb0btuuJE35VvcQi1KJVMB-Z3w7bVaSGVtlvn7U)\n\nThe DAO has only recently gained the ability to move funds between Polygon and Ethereum, while all other Treasuries are isolated, often leading to missed opportunities for leveraging the DAO’s funds. These opportunities are crucial for enhancing and capitalizing on synergies within the Aave ecosystem, including GHO management and the Safety Module.\n\n### Runway\n\nAccording to the latest [forecasted expenses](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-aave-funding-update/), the DAO’s 12-month budget is over $19M.\n\n|Category|Budget $k|Duration (mths)|Annualized Budget|\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|Security¹|$1,500|6|$3,000|\n|[Risk Management](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-aave-funding-update/15194/8)|$1,600|12|$1,600|\n|Bug Bounty|$1,000|12|$1,000|\n|Gov.

Certora only.\n2. AGD figures based on discussions with the team.\n\nWhile there are ongoing plans to secure part of this amount of stablecoins, most of it is allocated in high utilization Aave lending markets. Although reckoning the strategic rationale, holding most of the assets in the DAO’s own protocol exposes the portfolio to excessive risk in a volatility event scenario e.g. exploit.\n\n![|669x363](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/Aq6xqeeq_hr2ObgV9PFBiQrn6BFRk718dJywySHO4U7jRyUXSsMDyl7CdMhdf1cGOht1143KdBZy4mEagWkrum9CBeapl2HnDnSFfRbFNaPB4-3pZH0veEu8nMoo2cAw3-uohJYNq8s8zKUn-J45spg \"Chart\")\n\nWith the aim to support the protocol’s self-sustainability, treasury management should aim to reduce long tail asset exposure, ensure a 12-month financial runway and a stablecoins allocation that balances servicing Aave users and the DAO’s capital preservation.\n\n## GHO Development\n\nAave developed [GHO](https://docs.gho.xyz/concepts/overview) as a stablecoin native to the ecosystem and controlled by Aave Governance that enables a new level of transparency and censorship resistance. Technically, [GHO](https://etherscan.io/address/0x40d16fc0246ad3160ccc09b8d0d3a2cd28ae6c2f#readContract) is a collateral-backed stablecoin minted by users who lock up collateral assets in Aave's v3 protocol. The protocol uses smart contracts to manage the issuance and burning of the token through allow-listed entities called [Facilitators](https://docs.gho.xyz/concepts/how-gho-works/gho-facilitators), whose capacity to mint GHO (bucket) is enabled by Aave’s governance.\n\nAiming to enable committed AAVE token holders to capture additional value, GHO’s [debt strategy](https://etherscan.io/address/0x4C38Ec4D1D2068540DfC11DFa4de41F733DDF812#readContract) introduces an innovative concept of [rate discount](https://etherscan.io/address/0x4C38Ec4D1D2068540DfC11DFa4de41F733DDF812#readContract) by staking AAVE.\n\nWith an [on-chain vote executed in July](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/aave/proposal/268?chart=0), Aave launched GHO with two Facilitators (Aave itself and GHO FlashMinter), a borrowing rate of 1.5%, and a discount rate of 30% for AAVE stakers. Since then, the borrowing rate has been [increased to 4.72%](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0x9789e054e29f63da5713368be2dd0b4006f4564ef5e48c9d5e994ec20e932e35).\n\n![|690x391](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/7UXzX05dWaMixQmE4B-lkjHuv4-fu2jIFs8bn03_gLYG8hjpIm2mPHK4uhWVcyetMgZPUlWekoavWr1pfc43F15YuXkIZPy1r1K71mtU6WxdBl4rdzw4zMiABAUsHgRDP4d-BdkW_E-EcFgA1qArif0)\n\n![|691x345](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/qdTC5Jy9o8-ciz62oGpAZDGq2KOMK7V2h1S8PL-G6oawfXSJMz02eQSaeIofbcvmatQBOGogKZSyVDeLZCHpbSLDRsiCATHipR5EGO0lzc4jwoaiB3VpInOtUgiypK9UTy6mIflJpvlS6yaAmcn4pHE)\n\nAs demonstrated by GHO’s price chart, the most immediate challenge the Aave community is facing is the persistent trading of GHO at a discount practically since deployment. This trend has been influenced by higher stablecoin-enabled market rates like MakerDAO's Dai Savings Rate (DSR), creating a rate arbitrage opportunity. This cycle of borrowing and selling GHO harms GHO holders as it generates selling pressure, leading to a loss of value and eroding trust in GHO's stability. It also encourages a speculative pattern among GHO minters motivated to borrow and dump the asset, followed by repurchasing at a lower price, further driving down its value.\n\nFor the long-term health and success of GHO, two more enduring aspects require the community’s attention:\n\n### Peg Mechanisms\n\nThere's a crucial need for robust peg mechanisms tailored specifically for GHO that go beyond tactical borrow rate adjustments. Such mechanisms should be designed to help maintain GHO's value relative to its peg, irrespective of broader market movements or temporary arbitrage opportunities. Effective peg maintenance strategies will provide the dual benefits of protecting GHO's value in turbulent market conditions and reinforcing its utility as a stable and reliable medium of exchange within the DeFi ecosystem, thus addressing the core issue of price stability head-on.\n\n### Demand\n\nThe second one is generating organic demand that leads to an increased supply, mainly demand vectors external to the platform, but also including growth rooted in value-generating activities within the DeFi ecosystem. Without these value-generating flows, GHO faces the risk of remaining underutilized, hampering both its adoption and functionality as a stablecoin meant to facilitate economic activity.\n\n![|654x345](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/0K9JhuF5N6ScUkxYuGisZNp4S0IQ0qfc1ZvnW59aTIzisXhXB-4w5PX_2pzyTKs9sOlZkPikzm2IPx-uC_B366JsFOyHrmVqFYdLfmef0fBEaXquwkH-f48RAzVfmM9AqARhdcJ_EIQn7IrxaMv2fU0)\n\nCurrently, external demand for GHO has predominantly centered around its exchange for USD tokens and liquidity provision. While providing liquidity has been the sole avenue for yield generation, there has been a noticeable decrease in the allocated GHO liquidity recently.\n\n## Safety Module\n\nThe Aave Safety Module (SM) provides the DAO with an insurance-like fund expected to repay users of lost funds resulting from Aave’s smart contract exposure. The current composition of the insurance fund is overweight AAVE to the point where there exists a negative feedback loop between potential Bad Debt exposure and the AAVE token price.\n\n![|657x294](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/Haaciw-Es4QZS2QZBueQ1g1ar-L_e_Lp6MRd1neEqlzndAy5gha5PLUtYYo1QKy_k80ZGSP-cEGf-rVYbRrqZ3L0W_m6kcN3EZBcW2ciXFr5FZnQR-jPlKBHKgzQ20dOmlAVksGqlflbCk-At3Uq4d4)\n\nIf a Short Fall event was to occur, speculators could frontrun the AAVE auction, potentially even trigger liquidations on Aave Protocol, and cause the auction to occur at a lower than otherwise AAVE price. This unintentional feedback loop can be partially mitigated by modifying the safety module fund with the introduction of additional assets over time.\n\nFurthermore, the previously outlined negative feedback loop involving AAVE's price, liquidations, and bad debt results in a high cost for utilizing AAVE tokens. Consequently, it is necessary to reevaluate the incentivization of liquidity in the Safety Module, aiming for a more efficient allocation of DAO funds.\n\n![|693x410](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/675CMMvT7wcInW2NSWdJ11ByiOKa-aC627ziLQQ_WSVR_nRljGEgKdaxRZbS5RRiAQ5MSVuYC-_Vu2_5fSiWBLtmxBuENsf2GJnBVqkOnTdgH4BabaF680wEQkHSWK2OxkO87lQs9ncUOhb8yQEcyPk)\n\nThe daily cost of sustaining the SM is estimated to be approximately 100k USD per day at the prevailing AAVE distribution rate and market price. If all the AAVE and B-80AAVE-20wETH can be auctioned off at spot prices, the insurance funds coverage ranges from 1.7% to 3.2% of TVL over the last 18 months. For each $1 of coverage provided, the Aave DAO is paying approximately 31 cents each year. With a reduction in AAVE rewards, as proposed [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-treasury-management-amend-safety-module-aave-emissions/14936), the costs of sustaining the insurance fund will be reduced.\n\n## Why Partnering?\n\nAll of the topics mentioned above are deeply connected. Most of the assets contained in the treasury derive their value partly from their liquidity and the protocol’s security; the Safety Module’s effectiveness relies on attracting external capital through LP incentives; and GHO’s peg mechanism is dependant on liquidity, which could be incentivized using the treasury’s holdings.\n\nThere hasn’t been a holistic approach to these core activities of Aave DAO’s financials so far, which ultimately has led to [uncoordinated](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-enhancing-aave-daos-liquidity-incentive-strategy-on-balancer/15061/11?u=karpatkey) and inefficient decision-making processes.\n\nTokenLogic and karpatkey are partnering to provide Aave DAO with a comprehensive financial service solution. This partnership leverages:\n\n* Over three years of experience in advancing the Aave Protocol through a pivotal role in feature development and product adoption; and\n* A distinguished history of contributing to the most respected DAOs in the industry through specialized financial services.\n\nThe combined expertise of our teams is deeply rooted in the Aave ecosystem and extends across its community.\n\n### TokenLogic\n\nWe are a proactive team that puts our partners' needs first. Our developers are already actively contributing to the Aave Protocol, 23 AIPs to date. We believe in Aave’s incremental improvement process and building solutions that enable the DAO to manage its finances efficiently whilst minimizing external dependencies.\n\nOur dedication was demonstrated when we presented a proposal to improve the Aave DAO’s runway and built a preliminary frontend for the community. Our analysis will continue to showcase the interactive and transparent theme of the GHO Analytics platform. The refined scope primarily focuses on Treasury Management, GHO Liquidity/adoption and the Safety Module.\n\n### karpatkey\n\nkarpatkey is a DeFi-native organization specializing in professional DAO finance through industry-leading research and tooling since 2020. We’ve been working with [GnosisDAO](https://forum.gnosis.io/t/karpatkeys-weekly-report-on-gnosisdao-farms/6219), [Balancer](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/karpatkey-s-weekly-report-on-balancerdao-farms/4386), [ENS](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/endowment-weekly-reports/16665), [CoW Protocol](https://forum.cow.fi/t/cow-treasury-report-for-march-2023/1624https://forum.cow.fi/t/cow-treasury-report-for-march-2023/1624), and [Lido](https://snapshot.org/#/lido-snapshot.eth/proposal/0xac31f800288c68e32d1eb3cea7a525022faae3eb3bf805d1b3d248cda5375a13) on financial planning, operations, and strategy, diversifying their treasuries into sustainable portfolios of DeFi investments designed to support DAOs in executing their missions. Check out our [values](https://www.karpatkey.com/contents/karpatkey-values) to understand a bit more about our guiding and decision-making principles.\n\nAs DAO treasury developers, we contributed to some of the most reputable DeFi protocols in our industry. We supported the adoption of xDAI across Gnosis Chain, [paving the way](https://x.com/GnosisDAO/status/1673343419232526340) for the deployment of sDAI that [boosted chain TVL](https://x.com/DLNewsInfo/status/1714990022598787118) and consolidated a stablecoin hub with the integrations like Angle and Spark. Our extensive experience provided us with advanced practical knowledge on DeFi primitives like stableswap and concentrated liquidity AMMs, liquidity, and voting incentives, veTokenomics, leverage and lending platforms, and integrations with top protocols.\n\nIn addition to being an active [Aave delegate](https://governance.aave.com/t/karpatkey-delegate-platform/14417) with more than 90 governance votes since August 7th, we’ve contributed to the [development of an Aave fork](https://forum.gnosis.io/t/karpatkey-2022-year-in-review-for-gnosis/6431#lending-protocols-5) project and historically deployed, borrowed, and staked a combined $26.51M worth of LP positions in both Aave V2 and V3.\n\nWe now believe we can meaningfully contribute to solidifying Aave’s position as the leading DeFi lending protocol, not only through domain expertise but mostly through pushing positive-sum initiatives with the DAOs we work with.\n\n# Specification\n\nThis proposal outlines a collaborative framework between TokenLogic and karpatkey to manage the Aave DAO's treasury. Both parties will work in unison to ensure any future proposals within the agreed scope are jointly developed and endorsed.\n\n## Architecture for Asset Management Tooling\n\nWe aim to define and implement a robust architecture for asset management. At a high level, this architecture will enable non-custodial asset management, incorporating role-based access controls preapproved by the community that will enable treasury diversification and yield optimization. This system will ensure the Aave DAO retains full control over fund retrieval and permission management, facilitated through Aave’s \"shortExecutor\". All designs will be aligned with Aave best practices, and will encompass required steps to update existing infrastructure (e.g. SAM).\n\nAs the architecture for treasury management is being developed, the TokenLogic and karpatkey partnership will diligently progress with the necessary treasury operations, aligning them with the needs of the DAO and the stipulations of this proposal. All activities will be conducted in accordance with the established AIP model to avoid any disruptions.\n\n## Financial Security\n\nA key objective is to secure sufficient funds to ensure a one-year runway, aligning with the DAO's known budget and anticipated expenses as shared above. This approach guarantees financial stability and an operational continuity for Aave DAO.\n\nKey components of this objective will include:\n\n* Bridging Aave funds from other blockchains to consolidate them in Ethereum;\n* Migrating primary stablecoin funds from Aave v2 to Aave v3 for improved experience in using aTokens as payments; and\n* Swapping secondary stablecoins in mainnet prioritizing GHO.\n\nDo note, Financial statements have been omitted in order to present a cost conscious, high-impact solution within the current budget. If the Aave DAO wishes to explore having financial statements as part of a broader proposal, we can later expand the funding to include the additional scope.\n\nAs it currently stands, all necessary preparation for incorporating financial statements as part of the earlier TokenLogic proposal has been paused due to overall Aave budget considerations.\n\n## Formation of the Aave Liquidity Committee\n\nThis expanded committee will oversee the management of liquidity incentives and Aave-owned liquidity in alignment with Aave’s strategic asset goals. One of the main focus areas will be supporting GHO’s token price recovery. Key initiatives include:\n\n* Foster concentrated liquidity profiles that support GHO's price movement towards re-pegging, while maintaining its utility across a full range AMMs.\n  * Utilize Maverick's design to automate liquidity concentration as prices evolve, while reducing the friction caused by liquidity fragmentation in concentrated boosted pools.\n  * Optimize incentives on Uniswap v3 for concentrated liquidity, tailored across three categories: fees, GHO, and other USD token liquidity. Prioritize USD liquidity, particularly when GHO is off-peg.\n  * Continuously review and adjust incentives on platforms that yield the best results.\n  * Initial focus is on skewed liquidity distribution to support regaining the peg. However, it is paramount to ensure existing liquidity providers find sufficient utility on their GHO funds (through sustainable strategies that make use of Aave's AURA holding) to mitigate selling pressure.\n* Post-Repeg Strategy for GHO, explore sustainable approaches that preserve the token's value and expand its functional role within the ecosystem:\n  * Implement optimized liquidity strategies through Maverick and Merkl to achieve balanced liquidity and deeper market depth.\n  * Enhance GHO's extrinsic demand by incentivizing stableswap pools, such as Balancer's GHO pools, leveraging Aave’s capacity for a significant TVL increase.\n  * Work with Gyroscope to deploy liquidity pools that align with Balancer's architecture, using their advanced bonding curve model for concentrated liquidity AMMs. This strategic integration will use Aave-owned AURA to enhance GHO's price stability.\n  * Deploy and incentivize markets beyond USD-pegged assets, including ETH, ETH LSTs, EUR, and Real World Assets (RWAs). This diversification will open up new investment avenues and attract liquidity providers with varying risk appetites.\n  * Collaborate closely with Aave and specialized risk service providers to support the deployment and configuration of the GHO Stability Module (GSM). This coordination will focus on fine-tuning critical parameters, taking into account prevailing market conditions. Our objective is to integrate the GSM with managed capacity, potentially even before GHO achieves full re-pegging, as a strategic mechanism to foster price stability.\n* To optimize the utilization of surplus votes resulting from incentivized liquidity, we propose to leverage excess voting power effectively, transforming it in",

By leveraging Aptos’s innovative features—especially its use of the Move programming language—this move seeks to make the protocol more efficient, accessible, and resilient, positioning Aave to serve a broader audience and adapt to the evolving DeFi landscape.\n\nIf approved by the Aave community, Aave V3 will launch on Aptos Mainnet with a carefully chosen selection of assets, guided by community input and curated by Chaos Labs and Llama Risk.\n\nThis initiative aims to extend Aave into the thriving Aptos ecosystem—unlocking innovative growth opportunities and enhancing the value for both communities.\n\n# Background\n\nThe Aave Protocol has been EVM-native for over 6 years, ensuring widespread cross compatibility, a robust developer ecosystem, and significant network effects over the years both in terms of user base and liquidity. However, it also brings limitations, especially considering the existence of many non-EVM blockchains that offer different advantages such as lower transaction fees, higher throughput, and more advanced consensus mechanisms. In addition to purely technical advantages, many non-EVM blockchains can allow the Aave community to expand to an entirely new ecosystem, previously inaccessible user groups, and introduce new product possibilities.\n\nAptos is a blockchain designed for building scalable and secure dApps. Developed by former leaders of Meta’s Diem blockchain project, it aims to address some of the limitations in existing blockchain systems such as throughput, scalability, and security. With a TVL of approximately $958.64M and growing rapidly, Aptos is the 11th largest chain by TVL.  Its robust infrastructure offers high transaction throughput, low, predictable fees, and advanced security through the Move programming language that make Aptos an ideal platform for DeFi applications.\n\n# Motivation\n\nDeploying Aave V3 on Aptos represents a groundbreaking expansion as it marks Aave’s first deployment on a non-EVM blockchain. This strategic move is significant as it opens up new technological frontiers, diversifies Aave’s ecosystem, and underscores its commitment to innovation.\n\nBy leveraging Aptos’ innovative technology and developer community, Aave can address diverse financial needs, attract new users, and drive greater innovation in the DeFi sector. This deployment aligns with the Aave community’s strategic goal to explore new technological possibilities and tap into a wider pool of talent and resources.\n\n### Key benefits of deploying Aave V3 on Aptos include:\n\n**1. First Non-EVM Deployment:**\n\n  * This deployment is a significant milestone as Aave’s first move beyond EVM-compatible blockchains. It positions Aave to explore and integrate with new blockchain ecosystems, enhancing its resilience and broadening its reach.\n\n**2. Early Mover Advantage and Strong Brand:**\n\n  * Aave is a leading brand in the DeFi space, with a strong reputation and market share. By deploying on Aptos, Aave captures early mover advantages on a high-performance blockchain, similar to its strategic expansions to Avalanche and other L2s. This can attract both seasoned DeFi users and new participants exploring Aptos.\n\n**3. Aptos’ Strategic Position:**\n\n  * The Aptos team, with their background from Meta’s Diem project, has strong connections and expertise in finance, social and gaming sectors. Integrating Aave into Aptos complements these areas by adding a mature financial layer, essential for a complete blockchain ecosystem.\n\n**4. High Transaction Throughput:**\n\n  * Aptos supports up to 30,000 transactions per second (TPS) crucial for DeFi protocols like Aave that handle a high volume of transactions, including loans, repayments, and interest accruals. This high throughput can significantly enhance user experience and enable new use cases that require high-frequency transactions.\n\n**5. Enhanced Security with Move Language:**\n\n  * Aave v3 introduces sophisticated risk management tools and improved security protocols. The Move programming language used by Aptos has inherent security advantages, such as preventing reentrancy attacks. This alignment can lead to a more secure DeFi lending environment, leveraging Move’s safety features and formal verification.\n\n**6. Transaction Cost Efficiency:**\n\n  * Aave v3 focuses on gas efficiency, critical for reducing transaction costs. Aptos’ efficient processing capabilities further complement this by potentially lowering transaction fees even more. This makes Aave more accessible and attractive to a broader range of users, from retail participants to institutional players.\n\n**7. Modular and Flexible Architecture:**\n\n  * Aave v3’s modular and flexible architecture facilitates easier upgrades and expansions. Aptos supports upgradable smart contracts and a flexible account model, enhancing this aspect. This allows for seamless implementation of updates and improvements without significant disruptions or migrations.\n\n**8. Economic Benefits for the Aave DAO:**\n\n  * Market Share Growth: Access to new markets and user bases, specifically in APAC and Korea where Aptos has a strong presence.\n\n  * Revenue Growth: New markets and user bases can significantly increase transaction volumes and generate additional revenue streams.\n\n  * Incentives: Aptos Foundation has committed to provide up to 2M APT in liquidity mining incentives and rewards depending on performance in order to attract users and liquidity providers, increase adoption and boost the ecosystem’s growth. Aptos Foundation will work closely with Chaos Labs on determining the appropriate level of incentives relative to caps set.\n\n***By deploying Aave V3 on Aptos, we will have the first non-EVM deployment through which we can reach new user bases and tap into an ecosystem primed for high-demand DeFi applications, ensuring our protocol remains at the forefront of innovation.***\n\n# Specification\n\n## Risk Parameters\n\n> ARFC has been updated by ACI to reflect latest Risk Parameters provided by Risk Service Providers 2025-04-30\n\nWe recommend using Chainlink data for each asset, with the same setup for sUSDe as on Ethereum Core. \n\n## Specification\n\n| Parameter | Value | Value | Value | Value |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Asset | APT | USDC | USDT | sUSDe |\n| Isolation Mode | No | No | No | No |\n| Enable Borrow | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |\n| Enable Collateral | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |\n| Loan To Value | 58% | 75% | 75% | 65% |\n| Liquidation Threshold | 63% | 78% | 78% | 75% |\n| Liquidation Penalty | 10% | 5% | 5% | 8.5% |\n| Reserve Factor | 20% | 10% | 10% | 20% |\n| Liquidation Protocol Fee | 10% | 10% | 10% | 10% |\n| Supply Cap | 1,000,000 | 25,000,000 | 40,000,000 | 14,000,000 |\n| Borrow Cap | 500,000 | 23,000,000 | 37,000,000 | - |\n| Debt Ceiling | - | - | - | - |\n| UOptimal | 45% | 90% | 90% | - |\n| Base | 0% | 0% | 0% | - |\n| Slope1 | 7% | 6% | 6% | - |\n| Slope2 | 300% | 40% | 40% | - |\n| Stable Borrowing | No | No | No | No |\n| Flashloanable | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |\n| Siloed Borrowing | No | No | No | No |\n| Borrowable in Isolation | No | Yes | Yes | No |\n| E-Mode Category | N/A | sUSDe/Stablecoin | sUSDe/Stablecoin | sUSDe/Stablecoin |\n\n### sUSDe/Stablecoin\n\n| Asset | sUSDe | USDC | USDT |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Collateral | Yes | No | No |\n| Borrowable | No | Yes | Yes |\n| LTV | 90.00% | - | - |\n| LT | 92.00% | - | - |\n| Liquidation Bonus | 4.00% | - | - |\n\n## Technical Adaptation of Aave V3 to Aptos\n\nSince our last update—and following the successful TEMP CHECK snapshot vote—we have made significant progress in tailoring Aave V3 for Aptos. We have been actively engaging with the community through regular development updates and rigorous testing on the Aptos testnet while involving security auditors at every step. Our extensive efforts have ensured that Aptos is now fully prepared to host Aave’s next-generation protocol.\n\nKey areas of effort included:\n\n**1. Deep Protocol Understanding:**\n\n  * Comprehensive study of the intricate financial models and smart contract design of Aave V3, ensuring that the full complexity of the protocol is faithfully reimagined on Aptos.\n\n**2. Mastering Move and the Aptos Ecosystem:**\n\n  * Immersion into the Move language, its ecosystem, and best coding practices. This included analyzing standard native libraries, thoroughly understanding the Aptos VM architecture, and evaluating reference projects to inform our design choices.\n\n**3. Architectural Innovation:**\n\n  * Addressing Solidity limitations by rethinking architectural decisions in Move, with careful consideration given to gas optimization, safety, and security. This process ensured we employed best practices tailored to the Aptos environment.\n\n**4. Robust Development Process:**\n\n  * Building an MVP to evaluate model robustness, deployability, upgradability, scalability, and security. We re-implemented end-to-end, unit, and integration tests (including backward compatibility tests) and set up comprehensive pipelines for testing, compilation, deployment, audits, and documentation.\n\n**5. Tooling and Infrastructure:**\n\n  * Developing a complete front-end interface, a TypeScript SDK, and a custom fuzzer to stress-test our implementation. Additionally, we prepared the monitoring services, indexers, Rust-based services, and all necessary infrastructure to support a seamless go-live, including initial configuration, tokens, and faucets.\n\n**6. Governance Considerations:**\n\n  * Special attention was given to designing a governance strategy that aligns with the needs of a protocol on a new chain—starting with community guardians after launch, with future plans to integrate a full governance solution if market conditions warrant.\n\nThe UI is live and fully integrated with the TS SDK ensuring that developers can interact with the protocol and provide valuable feedback during the testnet phase. This level of preparation reflects our commitment to delivering a secure, efficient, and maintainable version of Aave V3 on Aptos.\n\n![Screenshot 2025-03-25 at 11.39.15.png](ipfs://bafkreibl3fjhchcmri3d7i7wuoiqfbhfafrhvnx34rfxqu3mqhgdplynea)\n\n\n### Architectural Changes\n\nThis section outlines how the modern architecture and unique benefits of Aptos were capitalized in building this while ensuring the protocol retains its core functionality and top notch security.\n\n**1. Modular Conversion:**\n\n  * *Ethereum Approach*: Aave V3 is composed of multiple interrelated Solidity contracts (e.g., LendingPool, Token Manager, Risk Engine).\n  * *Aptos Adaptation*: Each contract is restructured as a separate Move module. Move’s native module system enforces clear boundaries, enabling better separation of concerns, enhanced security and simplifying future upgrades.\n\n**2. Data & State Management:**\n\n  * *Solidity*: State variables are stored in contracts and accessed via delegatable external calls, which can sometimes lead to state inconsistencies.\n  * *Move*: The use of resources in Move ensures that each asset is uniquely tracked and can’t be duplicated or lost. This strict management helps maintain consistency across the protocol’s state, avoiding re-entrances, double spending and other attack vectors. Also, Aptos has a uniquely defined global storage whose resources can only be modified by the owner of the resources thus preventing the storage from being maliciously modified in a transaction.\n\n**3. Control Access:**\n\n  * *Solidity*: By design solidity allows external contracts to modify our own contract state which makes it hard to control and avoid unexpected 3rd party breaches.\n  * *Move*: Move modules have full control over their apis and do not allow by design delegate-calls (callbacks) to other contracts which prevents unexpected state-changes, re-entrances and other unwanted effects. On top of that, Aptos has a very secure system of allowing external modules to be friends and only scoping them to a particular scope of methods without ever giving control over its own resources.\n\n**4. Dispatch Mechanisms:**\n\n  * *Solidity*: Supports dynamic dispatch mechanism which enables a contract to call any other contract as long as a given interface is implemented. This can be however dangerous and the underlying implementation could often be replaced with a malicious one\n\n  * *Move*: On the contrary supports only static dispatch which introduces a high degree of security as an external call to a module can only succeed at static compilation at which point contract address and implementation are known and immutable.\n\n### Security Enhancements\n\n**1. Formal Verification & Type Safety:**\n\n  * *Move’s Built-in Features:* Move was designed from the ground up to support formal verification. We have engaged with Certora to leverage its built-in verifier for mathematically proving smart contract properties, significantly reducing risks like re-entrancy attacks, integer overflows, and other vulnerabilities common in Solidity.\n\n  * *Resource-Oriented Programming:* Resources in Move can only be created, moved, or destroyed in prescribed ways. This model ensures that token balances and collateral remain consistent and secure throughout all operations.\n\n### Performance and Gas Efficiency\n\n**1. Optimized Transaction Costs:**\n\n  * *Gas Model Comparison*: Whereas Solidity requires significant manual optimization to reduce gas consumption, Move’s design inherently minimizes resource usage. This results in lower fees and more predictable transaction costs on Aptos.\n\n**2. Parallel Execution with Block-STM:**\n\n  * *Enhanced Throughput*: Aptos’s Block-STM consensus allows for parallel transaction processing. This means that high-frequency operations (like loan issuance, repayments, and interest accruals) can be handled simultaneously, reducing bottlenecks and improving overall performance.\n\n**3. Atomic Transactions:**\n\n  * *Consistency*: All operations in Move are executed as part of an atomic transaction. This guarantees that either every part of an operation completes successfully or none do, preventing partial state changes and enhancing reliability. Transactions modifying the same state are executed atomically and linearized.\n\n### Developer Experience and Future-Proofing\n**1. Improved Modularity & Maintainability:**\n\n  * *Move’s Module System*: The modular architecture in Move not only organizes code in a logical manner but also facilitates isolated testing, easier upgrades, and reusability of code components.\n\n**2. Enhanced Tooling:**\n\n  * *Ecosystem Maturity*: The Move ecosystem is evolving rapidly, building improved IDE plugins, debugging tools, and testing frameworks. These tools will aid developers in writing, testing, and deploying smart contracts with greater confidence.\n\n**3. Future Integrations:**\n\n  * *Adaptability*: The structured approach of Move allows for easier integration of new features or protocol improvements in the future. As the Aptos ecosystem grows, Aave V3 can seamlessly evolve to incorporate emerging trends and requirements.\n\n**4. Governance Strategy:**\n\n* *Phased Approach to Governance*: Initially, Aave Labs will retain control of the critical protocol keys while the market is in its early stages. Over the coming months—as the market matures, operates smoothly, and undergoes rigorous verification—we will gradually transition key management to trusted community guardians who will provide oversight and help manage early protocol decisions. In parallel, we will engage with relevant service providers to evaluate the feasibility of integrating the Aave Governance V3 system alongside a.DI, ensuring that future governance processes remain robust and fully aligned with community interests.\n\n### Development & Testing\n\n**1. Testnet Deployment:**\n\n  * A fully functional testnet for Aave V3 on Aptos is already live. This environment is used for rigorous testing of Move modules, simulating real-world scenarios.\n\n**2. Audit & Security Reviews:**\n\n  * Comprehensive internal and external audits are done and ongoing with companies like: SpearBit/Cantina, Certora and OtterSec. These will focus on ensuring that the Move modules adhere to Aave's strict security and performance standards.\n  * After the audits are complete, a Security Contest will go live followed by a comprehensive Bug Bounty program when we go live. This initiative, funded by Aave Labs, the Security Contest will offer a total reward pool of $150,000 paid in GHO stablecoin. The contest is designed to incentivize thorough testing and uncover any potential vulnerabilities, ensuring that our protocol meets the highest security standards prior to the mainnet launch.\n\n**3. Audit Reports**: github com/aave/aptos-aave-v3/tree/main/audits\n\n**4. Developer & Community Feedback:**\n\n  * Continuous feedback will be solicited from our developer community to ensure that the transition to Move is smooth and that any issues are promptly addressed.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nDeploying Aave V3 on Aptos presents a significant opportunity to drive Aave's growth and expansion. By leveraging Aptos’s innovative capabilities and the power of the Move programming language, we can build a protocol that not only enhances efficiency and security but also broadens our reach into new markets and developer communities. This strategic initiative positions Aave at the forefront of DeFi innovation, enabling us to tap into emerging opportunities and accelerate ecosystem-wide growth.\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. Integrate Chaos Labs and LamaRisk suggested assets and risk parameters report once available.\n2. Refine the ARFC based on community feedback and risk providers recommendations.\n3. Submit the ARFC for a Snapshot vote for final approval.\n4. If consensus is reached, submit an onchain AIP Vote for Aave V3 on Aptos (upon Mainnet launch)",

        "body": "---\n### [TEMP CHECK] AAVEnomics update\n### Author: ACI\n###  Date: 2024-07-25\n---\n### Simple Summary:\n\nThis proposal seeks governance feedback and consensus on leveraging the Safety Module Umbrella update to create a clear path and roadmap related to the protocol \"fee switch\", defined as updated \"AAVEnomics\".\n\n## Motivation\n\n### Before we start\n\nThis proposal leverages the https://governance.aave.com/t/bgd-aave-safety-module-umbrella/18366 proposal, it is strongly advised to read it before diving into the current proposal.\nThe current proposal has been peer-reviewed by Aave service providers and active Aave DAO community representatives & delegates.\n\n### Introduction\n\nThe Aave protocol is the clear market leader in the liquidity vertical and is focused on expanding in both the stablecoin and bridging verticals. The protocol's TVL and net profit growth have largely outpaced market conditions thanks to the coordinated efforts of service providers appointed by DAO governance.\nThe Aave protocol is also the clear leader on every network Aave has deployed to, and when given a choice, DeFi users leverage Aave over alternatives.\nThis has allowed the Aave DAO not only to \"cover its own bills\" but also has built [a large treasury of ETH and stablecoins](https://aave.tokenlogic.xyz/treasury).\n\n \n![treasury.jpeg](ipfs://bafkreihrskqratcejxrmldlzopv4lj42esks3cgel2kugnd3ijzlt4leui)\n    \n\nAdditionally, during the past couple of quarters, the DAO explored revenue sharing with the Merit program, which is essentially a redistribution of the protocol's net stablecoin excess revenue to the GHO minters and stakers to support aligned behaviors and the growth of GHO. Alongside Merit, the Ahab program, which is funded by protocol net ETH & ETH-correlated assets, is mobilized to attract strategic liquidity in Aave markets, supporting protocol growth in the main & new markets.\n\nWith the ACI, we consider the DAO now ready to explore a further step in the protocol's maturity and would like to submit for governance consideration a clear path for protocol net excess revenue redistribution to the key actors of the Aave ecosystem, creating new positive dynamics and novel synergies within the industry.\n\nThis journey is designed in several incremental steps. This proposal seeks feedback on the journey as a whole as a “TEMP CHECK” and approval to begin the first step via a potential “ARFC”.\n\nTo ensure the DAO's long-term sustainability, new steps will be escalated when the protocol reaches specific growth and net excess revenue milestones.\n\n## Umbrella: A Proposed Safety Module Paradigm Shift\n\nThe Safety Module is a crucial line of defense for the Aave protocol. In case of a shortfall event, and if liquidators do not complete their tasks, the Safety Module is designed to assume the excess debt on behalf of users to avoid or at least mitigate bad debt events.\n\nFortunately, the Safety Module has never been needed for the Aave protocol. The few excess debt events in Aave protocol history have been addressed by governance through the mobilization of \"cash\" DAO treasury funds.\n\nHowever, the current model is inefficient as it relies on secondary liquidity to liquidate Safety Module assets to obtain excess debt assets and clear debt.\n\nWith both GHO and StkAAVE, the primary issue with the Safety Module is that the current $424M hosted in the Safety Module cannot effectively clear $424M of excess debt. This is because:\n\n1. The value of AAVE would be negatively impacted due to slippage.\n2. The GHO peg is unlikely to withstand the mobilization of almost two-thirds of its current supply.\n\nWhile it is highly improbable to encounter an excess debt event of this magnitude (precedent was less than 1% of this amount), the entire model has room for optimization.\n\nTherefore, Umbrella proposes:\n\n1. Segregation of coverage\n2. Elimination of reliance on secondary liquidity\n\nFrom now on, the Safety Module activation should focus on slippage-free debt burn coverage.\n\nUmbrella allows the deployment of aTokens Safety Modules that are more cost efficient and provides better protection to Aave users; This proposal seeks approval on a multi-step journey toward Umbrella Activation and redefines the Role & benefits of the AAVE assets & tokenomics in the Aave ecosystem.\n\n## Umbrella Coverage Adoption Journey\n\nAs an initial and immediate step:\n\nWe propose segregating StkGHO and StkAAVE Safety Module coverages to distinguish protections and improve StkGHO Safety Module efficiency, which would protect the GHO stablecoin.\n\nWith this upgrade, the StkGHO Safety Module is meant to only protect users from GHO debt and is mobilized to clear GHO excess debt only.\n\nGHO is a young stablecoin with limited secondary liquidity. In the current stage of GHO maturity, mobilizing GHO to protect other assets' debt will mean the death of the GHO peg and trust in GHO for limited resources gained.\n\nHowever, in the context of GHO debt protection only, StkGHO is a perfect tool. In case of a shortfall event, GHO can be seized in the Safety Module and used to clear excess debt by burning GHO. This action is absolutely slippage-free and will not impact the GHO peg.\n\nSafety Module users will suffer a below 1 StkGHO <> GHO exchange rate, but it's a risk they willingly accepted by staking.\n\nExample: If there's 100M GHO in the Safety Module and the protocol suffers a $3M excess debt GHO shortfall event, via an AIP, 3M GHO will be seized from the Safety Module to clear the debt. As a result, the StkGHO/GHO exchange rate will drop to 0.97, leading to a socialized net haircut of 3% for all Safety Module stakers (around 6 weeks of the current reward rate).\n\nThis paradigm shift will make GHO the safest and most trustworthy stablecoin in the ecosystem with currently both an average overcollateralization ratio of 2.5 and ~65% of the supply that can be mobilized to clear any form of excess debt without impacting the GHO peg.\n\nThis will de facto make Ethereum StkGHO the first Safety Module adopting the Umbrella standard.\n\nThese changes come at the cost of temporarily reduced overall V3 protection, but as discussed earlier, GHO is not mature enough to be a suitable asset to protect other debts than GHO at this moment. The reduced protection will be covered by the introduction of new Safety Modules in further steps.\n\nWe propose adopting the following:\n\n### Umbrella coverage adoption Journey doctrine:\n\n1. The Legacy Safety Module coverage is set to all live networks Aave V3 debt until replaced.\n2. The Legacy StkGHO SM protects GHO debt exclusively. This safety module becomes the prime candidate for becoming the first Umbrella safety module instance via upgrade.\n3. The Umbrella Ethereum Safety Modules will not automatically cover Aave V3 deployments; coverage must be opt-in by governance vote.\n4. Mid-term: segregate risk further by deploying network-specific Umbrella Safety Modules financed by protocol \"local\" net excess revenue.\n\n\n### StkGHO Migration and upgrade Journey\n\nGHO is growing and is meant to be a profitable product of the Aave protocol. At ~150/175M GHO, GHO is expected to be net profitable for the protocol, with revenue outpacing system subsidies.\n\nCurrently, GHO has a dual reward system with rewards in AAVE sourced from the ecosystem reserve and Merit airdrops sourced from protocol net profits.\n\nWe propose, in resonance with previous governance decisions, to slowly cut rewards of the StkGHO safety module in favor of a potential Umbrella StkGHO safety module.\n\nThe Merit programs yielded great results in terms of growth, peg preservation, and user behavior optimization. We propose to maintain the Merit program in its current form.\n\nThis will keep a dual reward system for StkGHO: a \"base yield\" paid continuously in GHO to stakers and an \"Airdrop\" yield via Merit that can be optimized to reward more users with net positive behavior for the protocol, maintaining \"boosts\" of most wanted behavior but ensuring a sustainable \"base yield\" for this part of the Safety Module. Both of these rewards are financed by Aave protocol net revenue.\n\nIn practical terms, The Legacy GHO safety module has whitelisted AAVE emissions until Oct 2024 and benefit from Merit, we propose to slowly incentivize user migration to the Umbrella stkGHO by letting the AAVE distribution slowly expire and changing the Merit reward focus on Umbrella on the next Merit round post-publication.\n\nThis will slightly increase cost and efficiency by having a few weeks off incentives on both StkGHO safety module but gains on users experience allowing them to migrate at their own pace justifies it.\n\n## A new role for Aave beyond the Legacy Safety module, AAVENomics update.\n\nAAVE is the center of gravity of the Aave protocol. It is the governance asset of the DAO, allowing true control and ownership of the Aave protocol to a degree not achieved in any other protocol in our industry. But as a Safety Module asset, it's simply not efficient enough. AAVE is not a debt token in the Aave protocol and is not as liquid as ETH and major stablecoins.\n\n### End the \"Seize and Sell\" Doctrine\n\nThe \"seize and sell\" doctrine is dangerous as it's inefficient due to slippage, creates the need to subsidize strong secondary liquidity (StkBPT Safety Module), and causes great price pressure on the asset in case of mobilizing the Safety Module. This reduces the cost of acquiring a large amount of AAVE and taking effective control and ownership of the protocol. With historically 15-30% of the Aave supply in the Safety Module and considering the average governance participation, this risk must be seriously considered.\n\nAdditionally, the relatively low maximum slashing of 30% of the AAVE Safety Module means the protocol is allocating funds that are mostly not even mobilizable to protect the protocol.\n\nLastly, the AAVE Safety Module is not sustainable as it is subsidized by the ecosystem reserve that will eventually run out of funds.\n\nWe propose the AAVE Safety Module to not be included in the Umbrella update, StkAAVE will evolve into a staking role acting as a liquidity sink and a way to collect rewards generated from the protocol revenue and other protocol benefits.\n\n### StkBPT Redefinition\n\nThe Aave DAO has spent large amounts of resources incentivizing AAVE's secondary liquidity to maintain the current Safety Module paradigm.\n\nWhile the secondary liquidity of AAVE is important, it should not be a focus of the Safety Module.\n\nThe DAO earned experience with secondary liquidity management with the Aave Liquidity Committee (ALC) program, yielding great results on GHO peg and growth.\n\nWe propose not including StkBPT from the Umbrella Safety Modules and appoint the ALC to manage AAVE secondary liquidity. We also propose the introduction of a \"Buy & Distribute\" program funded by the protocol's excess revenue, With a budget defined by Aave Finance service providers and management by the ALC.\n\nThe ALC and Aave Finance service providers will continue their journey of decentralization and automatization of these processes, contributing to a future with the human element as removed as possible from these actions.\n\nThis will increase the Safety Module's budget efficiency, make the subsidy of secondary liquidity sustainable, and allow more granular liquidity management. It is expected to optimize the funds needed to maintain the expected outcome.\n\nIn this new system, Liquidity will still be incentivized, but we expect a large optimization in the cost and management of this secondary liquidity.\n\n### Introduction of Anti-GHO\n\nCreating a GHO borrow rate discount was a good idea to align AAVE holders and GHO minters, but the discount mechanism is not efficient in terms of protocol accounting and can be optimized.\n\nWe propose, based on discussions with several service providers, particularly Bgd Labs, the removal of the GHO borrow rate discount and the introduction of a new “anti-GHO” token generated by StkAAVE holders minting GHO.\n\nThe users linearly accumulate anti-GHO, which is claimable at the user's will. Anti-GHO generation is proportionate to the interest accumulated by all GHO borrowers.\n\nAnti-GHO is a non-transferable ERC-20 linked to a couple of special-purpose GHO facilitators that can be used in two ways:\n\n1. Burn Anti-gho to mint GHO used to repay their own GHO debt \"for free.\"\n \n![burn anti gho mint.png](ipfs://bafkreifvldjg2ivjc3x7li4hmv4v4bde5xii6p6vwnlm6cdh62zgtlwv5m)\n    \n\n2. Mint GHO to be deposited on the user’s behalf in the GHO Safety Module and distribute StkGHO to the user.\n\n \n![holders stkaave.jpeg](ipfs://bafkreibylsxdbvqvwllrvmkd3x6b7e6dqcvuo6tnbevzz5g7jppb2hjp7a)\n    \n\n\nBoth special-purpose facilitators' \"debt\" will be regularly \"cleared\" by mobilizing GHO from the Aave Collector via Aave treasury regular AIPs to repay, ensuring no long-term unbacked GHO in the protocol.\n\nThis new system is more efficient, increases the alignment of AAVE stakers with GHO borrowers, and officially introduces revenue sharing of part of the Aave protocol revenue to some AAVE stakers, acting as the initial step of a more ambitious excess revenue-sharing strategy.\n\n### Closing the LEND chapter\n\nNearly 4 Years ago, After the launch of Aave V1, the Aave protocol proposed the initial AAVEnomics migrating the legacy asset LEND into the current AAVE token.\nAfter a significant amount of time passed and witnessing the lack of activity of the legacy asset, we take this proposal as an opportunity to close the LEND chapter.\n\nWe consider that 4 years and the amount of time that will pass for these proposals, publications, approvals, implementations, and execution to offer ample and fair notice to legacy users to migrate to AAVE, we propose to deactivate the legacy migrator contract and transfer the remaining balance to the Ecosystem reserve to be mobilized for Aave Stakers and protocol growth.\n\n## Activate Umbrella Atokens Safety Module, initiate “Buy and Distribute” AAVENomics\n\nThe Aave protocol is seen as the industry standard in terms of resilience and safety, making Safety Modules of Aave a popular option for protecting protocol users despite the risks.\n\nAdditionally, ~80% of the Aave protocol users deposit in the protocol but do not have Aave debt. Their use case of the protocol is to seek yield on liquidity provided. These users consider the Aave protocol safe enough to keep their assets inside the protocol contracts for the long term.\n\nThe paradigm shift to \"seize and burn\" instead of the current \"seize and sell\" increases the Safety Module efficiency significantly. The natural progression of this strategy is to mobilize users who consider the Aave protocol safe enough to hold their assets and do not seek to create debt to consider renouncing their Safety Module protection, their borrowing power and short-term aToken liquidity (cooldown period) in exchange for extra yield.\n\nThis is done by adding a Atoken category to the Umbrella Safety Module. In case of a shortfall event, these tokens are seized and used to burn debt, just as the StkGHO Umbrella Safety Module will function.\n\nMost of the Aave protocol debt is in wETH and stablecoins.\n\nTherefore, we are gathering feedback on the initiation of Umbrella Atoken Safety Modules with awETH and aUSDC.\n\nThis allows for covering most of the debt in the protocol if these assets need to be mobilized.\nBecause debt can be repaid in aTokens in Aave V3, the available secondary liquidity of these aTokens is not relevant in excess debt clearing.\n\nTo cover debt labeled in other assets, USDC and ETH are the most liquid assets in the ecosystem, making slippage considerations a low issue, especially with a focused scope of Safety Module coverage introduced earlier.\n\naTokens Safety Modules are proposed to be primarily rewarded in their respective aTokens, financed by their respective Reserve Factor collection on their assets and correlated assets.\n\nUmbrella multi-reward support allows for more mid-term synergies for “Re-Staking”, which will be explored further in this TEMP CHECK.\n\nDetails and budgets of these Umbrella Atokens Safety modules should be discussed at the ARFC stage with feedback from both Risk & Finance teams.\n\nWe’re confident this will allow a factually superior coverage of the Aave V3 protocol at a fraction of the current costs.\n\n### Activate a \"Buy & Distribute\" Program\n\nWith the new efficient Umbrella safety modules, it is expected that the protocol revenue surplus will increase. With sustainability reached milestones, this net excess revenue should be mobilized and redirected to token stakers currently funded via the ecosystem rewards contract.\n\nIn terms of rewards, the ecosystem rewards will eventually run out of funds. That being said, we propose that StkAAVE remains compensated in AAVE tokens as stakers are already aligned with the asset. To achieve this, a \"Buy & Distribute\" program is introduced to acquire AAVE assets on secondary markets from protocol revenue and distribute them to the ecosystem reserve. This upgrades the current AAVE safety module in a new “Staking Module”, not part of Umbrella.\n\nThere's little to no difference in user experience from the current situation, but in terms of protocol sustainability, it's a paradigm shift. This new system also introduces a constant demand side for the AAVE asset on secondary markets.\n\nIt is proposed that this program be funded with the net excess revenue of the protocol.\n\nRewards rates will be defined according to protocol net excess revenue and will reflect the actual financial results of the protocols, with periods of higher rewards to potential periods with zero yield.\n\nWe propose that the Aave Finance service providers manage the \"Buy & Distribute\" program via treasury AIPs to increase efficiency in the short term. We believe this process also needs to be part of the Journey of decentralization, and we expect the Aave Finance service providers to contribute to a future with the human element as removed as possible from this program \n\nFor an easier understanding of the new AAVEnomics vision, please consider the following visual representation:\n\n \n![visual representation.jpeg](ipfs://bafybeigfqm7tms5yc2homzrgar6ikt6bbplco4cejmqg5i7jqngalmm2eq)\n    \n\n## “Re-Staking” Umbrella Beyond Aave\n\nAave's Safety track record speaks for itself; while Aave had several excess debt events, the DAO never had to mobilize the legacy Safety module. With the Umbrella upgrade, we expect the efficient coverage to increase significantly compared to the current situation, from a theoretical $100m to likely billions of mid-terms.\n\nThe Aave DAO can mobilize and monetize this coverage beyond the Aave protocol. The Aave DAO service providers are risk experts who can give valuable coverage recommendations to the Aave governance.\n\nThe Umbrella multi-token incentives controller allows for rewards in several tokens, and we believe this cost-efficient coverage of already existing significant liquidity will be of high interest for third-party protocols and networks, as shown by the high interest of the “Restaking” DeFi vertical.\n\nWhile the journey to maturity on this vertical is still long, the ACI wanted to share this mid-term vision to the community of a potential new journey for protocol revenue and Umbrella Stakers Yield.\n\n## Specification\n\n### Milestones and Trigger Conditions\n\nWhile the Aave protocol's net excess revenues are at an all-time high, it would be reckless to implement significant new budget spending without considering the protocol's long-term sustainability.\nFrom a user experience perspective, a too-ambitious distribution schedule being forced to halt due to more adverse revenue collection conditions will lead to massive and unwanted frustration.\nThe Aave DAO has always been a conservative actor and has always prioritized long-term sustainability over short-term yield.\n\nWe suggest considering the following elements as key data points to execute changes in Safety Modules in steps:\n\n- Aave Collector net holdings\n- Service providers' recurring budget\n- Merit and ALC program recurring budgets\n- GHO supply\n- GHO 30-day average revenue\n- Protocol 30-day average revenue\n\nThe ACI Proposes this vision to be implemented in 3 differents ARFCs to be sequentially proposed alongside reaching set milestones, we welcome governance feedback on this implementation Journey.\n\n## Initial ARFC Doctrine Adoption and Deployment of First Umbrella Safety Module: StkGHO\n\nAdoption of the Following Doctrine:\n\n1. The Current StkAAVE and StkBPT Safety modules becomes the “Legacy Safety Module”\n2. The Legacy Safety Module is set to cover all live networks Aave V3 debt with a market size exceeding $100M and older than one year until replaced.\n3. The StkGHO Safety modules protect GHO debt.\n4.

The current proposal is focused on implementing Aavenomics and is meant to be more concise than the TEMP CHECK for improved readability.\n\n### Introduction\n\nThe Aavenomics update TEMP CHECK was approved around six months ago, since then, the Aave protocol reinforced it’s leadership in the Defi vertical and became the #1 Defi protocol in general.\nAave's market share has increased every quarter for the past two years, and GHO crossed $200m supply with healthy revenue despite harsher market conditions at the end of Q1 2025.\n\nEvery triggering milestone for implementation has been met, and Aave successfully upgraded to Aave 3.3 recently, thanks to the relentless efforts of @bgdlabs.\n\nAave protocol revenue remains strong despite market conditions, and the \"cash\" portion of our Aave DAO has increased by 115% since the adoption of the Aavenomics TEMP CHECK—now sitting at $115M. This growth occurred despite having the largest budget in Aave DAO history, due to V4 financing to Aave Labs (half of the DAO service providers budget but “one-off” expense) and the Merit revenue sharing experiment (around 20% of the Aave DAO budget).\n\nWhile the downturn in interest rates affects the Aave DAO revenue, the protocol still maintains near-total dominance over revenue generated by lending protocols in the industry.\n\n### Expected growth of revenue in 2025\n\nHigh revenue and high cash reserves put Aave in a comfortable position to initiate the Aavenomics update, and current market conditions allow Aave to become even more competitive and gain market share. Most competitors do not have cash in hand to finance incentives, so they must rely on distributing their native assets; yield farmers are wary of holding these tokens and are more willing to exchange them for cash as token valuations decline in secondary markets.\n\nAave is the only current protocol with an impeccable reputation for quality, making it the natural choice for most DeFi users even when yields are equal to or slightly lower than competitors'. Additionally, the protocol has the cash reserves necessary to distribute incentives in high-quality assets—a luxury no one else can afford in the current industry environment.\n\nAave revenue is also expected to increase with the introduction of Chainlink-powered SVR, allowing the protocol to extract revenue while protecting users from bad debt in market downturns. This revenue—while difficult to predict since it's tied to market volatility that is inherently unpredictable—is expected to be significant (up to more than $10M/year) and can be mobilized to finance part of the Aavenomics.\n\nAnother exclusive Aave perk is Umbrella. With this new self-protection system, Aave will be the only protocol able to protect users from bad debt up to billions, as competitors have essentially given up on protecting their users. This unique advantage will make Aave even more attractive, especially for institutions concerned with on-chain risks.\n\nLastly, one \"unexpected\" side effect of Umbrella is the de facto commitment of liquidity that will remain in the protocol until cooldown maturity. This will secure liquidity, make potential bank run events less harmful, and, more importantly, can be mobilized to build new products and revenue streams around this \"committed liquidity.\" Examples include cross-chain position financing and \"restacking\" of Aave committed liquidity for the safety of third-party protocols. Aave is well-armed to enter this strategic DeFi vertical and generate significant new revenues from it.\n\n### Creation of the Aave Finance Committee and Umbrella focus\n\nWe propose utilizing Umbrella as both a protective mechanism for Aave users and a growth tool by redistributing part of the Aave DAO excess revenue to Umbrella aToken stakers. We also recognize a strategic opportunity in the L2 landscape to mobilize revenue from existing networks toward L2s that are most strategic for Aave's growth.\n\nFor implementation, we propose mobilizing the talent of current Aave DAO service providers to form an Aave Finance Committee (AFC). This committee will be tasked with managing Aave collector contract holdings and defining the Umbrella liquidity target ratios and budgets tailored for both safety and growth. We propose founding members who equally represent risk, growth, and treasury management, with a 3/4 signature threshold.\n\nBy definition, the committee needs to be reactive to market conditions. Implementing every change on every network via AIPs is not compatible with efficient management. Therefore, we suggest that part of the AFC's mandate execution stems from token approvals done by Tokenlogic during their monthly treasury management AIPs, which will allow the committee to pull and distribute budgets as needed.\n\nThis approach will also simplify implementation, as some L2 revenue is expected to be spent on other, more strategic L2s.\n\nWhile cross-chain bridging by AIPs is theoretically possible (and done regularly between Avalanche, Polygon & Mainnet), it remains inefficient. This is why a new Bridge Steward connecting Collectors contracts on all networks is required, and Bgd Labs will propose one shortly. This will allow Treasury management AIPs to be slightly less complex and more focused on swapping major assets and delivering token approvals, making the risk surface thinner and review more seamless.\n\nWe suggest mandating both Tokenlogic and ACI to lead this AFC under the supervision and control of risk service providers who can block any potential collusion between them.\n\n### Umbrella Asset Focus\n\nFor efficiency and to reflect which tokens are the most strategic, borrowed and in need of Umbrella protection, we suggest focusing Umbrella on the following assets:\n\n- wETH\n- USDC\n- USDT\n- GHO (via StkGHO)\n\nAnd when needed native assets to be defined separately such as wAVAX, wS, GNO\n\n### Rewards Distribution Tokens\n\nFor rewards tokens, we suggest the following tokens:\n\nSourced from RF collection:\n\n- wETH\n- USDC\n- USDT\n\nSourced from the Ecosystem reserve\n\n- AAVE\n\nand if available, third-party funded incentives budgets.\n\n### Network Implementation\n\nWe suggest activating Umbrella on the following networks:\n\n- Ethereum Mainnet, Core & Prime instances\n- Avalanche Network\n- Sonic\n- Arbitrum\n- Gnosis\n- Base\n\n### Aave Finance Committee funding members\n\n- Chaos Labs\n- Tokenlogic\n- Llamarisk\n- ACI\n\n## AAVE secondary liquidity management\n\nThe Aave DAO currently allocates a significant portion of the Ecosystem Reserve—approximately $27 million per year at current AAVE valuation—to secondary liquidity incentives. While AAVE's secondary liquidity remains critical for the protocol, the Umbrella upgrade has rendered the old Safety Module ready for deprecation in favor of a more efficient system.\n\nWe believe we can achieve the same or even greater amounts of secondary liquidity for AAVE at a fraction of the current budget. Since one of the main goals of the Aavenomics global project is to eventually have the DAO source all AAVE distribution through secondary market buybacks, maintaining tight control over spending efficiency is crucial.\n\nTherefore, we propose gradually complementing the current StkBPT staking with a hybrid system. This new approach will continue to leverage StkBPT staking while allocating part of the budget to the current Aave Liquidity Committee (ALC). This will enable the committee to take a more hands-on approach to shaping secondary liquidity for the AAVE token. To implement this, the proposal seeks governance approval to grant the ALC a mandate for AAVE token allowance from the Ecosystem reserve, enabling them to define budgets and distribute rewards efficiently—similar to what has been achieved with GHO.\n\n### Close the LEND chapter\n\nAs announced multiple times over the past years and nearly half a decade after opening the LEND to AAVE migration contract, it's time to close the LEND chapter and focus on AAVE.\n\nThis proposal will remove all remaining AAVE—320k tokens at the time of writing—from the migration contract and redirect them to the ecosystem reserve.\n\nGiven that the community has had multiple years of notice, we consider it fair to close down the migration process. These long-dormant funds (approximately $65M at current AAVE price) will then be available to the DAO to be mobilized for growth, safety, or burn proposals by governance.\n\n### Protocol excess revenue for AAVE stakers\n\nThe previous elements of this proposal will impact the Aave DAO budget, yet they are not expected to significantly harm Aave protocol excess revenue. Furthermore, the growth anticipated from updates, new products, and our substantial current cash reserves makes us confident that we can initiate and maintain a \"Buy and distribute\" program, even in the face of recent unfavorable market conditions.\n\nThe protocol has already successfully implemented and maintained a revenue redistribution program in the form of Merit for more than a year, distributing $12m/year of protocol revenue to GHO stakers at current GHO borrow rates and supply. This program is now self-sufficient and no longer financed by revenue from third-party stables, making the \"Merit is forever\" meme a strong reality.\n\nIt's now time to increase our ambitions to match the current protocol economy and upgrade both StkAAVE & StkBPT tokenomics. This will enhance rewards to Aave ecosystem stakers with excess protocol revenue.\n\n### Creation of Anti-GHO\n\nThe \"anti-GHO\" name derives from \"anti-matter.\" Anti-GHO is a non-transferable ERC20 token generated by AAVE and StkBPT Stakers. It is produced linearly through the Merit/MASIv system, with boosts and diluters applied, and is claimable bi-weekly by all Aave stakers.\n\nAnti-GHO can be used in two ways:\n\n- Burned at a 1:1 ratio against GHO debt in the protocol (hence the \"anti-GHO\" name), allowing users to reduce their GHO debt in Aave at no extra cost\n- Converted to StkGHO, which is fully eligible for Merit & other Aave incentives, and after cooldown, convertible to GHO\n\nAnti-GHO is designed to fully deprecate and replace the current GHO discount. This represents a leap forward in excess revenue distribution, as the GHO discount was only available to StkAAVE stakers who also had GHO debt in the protocol, whereas Anti-GHO will be generated by all AAVE and StkBPT Stakers.\n\nThe Anti-GHO budget stems from GHO revenue generation by the protocol and scales linearly with it. A governance-defined percentage of all GHO facilitators' revenue is dedicated to minting and distributing Anti-GHO. These parameters will adjust in line with the actual protocol economy, making it both a sustainable and scalable budget tied to Aave's success.\n\nThe current large DAO cash reserve provides the protocol with a comfortable buffer to maintain Merit rewards on top of Anti-GHO generation, even if the protocol economy faces pressure from a cyclical industry \"bear\" downturn.\n\nWe propose setting the initial parameters of Anti-GHO generation at 50% of GHO revenue. At the time of writing, the GHO supply is 186M generating a 6.45% (non-discount) yield; therefore, GHO revenue is currently at $12M/year. The current proposal would generate 6M anti-GHO/year for Aave stakers.\n\nWe propose distributing 80% of anti-GHO rewards to StkAAVE holders and 20% to StkBPT holders.\n\nAny slight deficit in the GHO balance sheet due to Merit & ALC budgets will be financed with excess revenue from other stablecoins in the Aave protocol, with the clear goal of reaching GHO sustainability and profitability in 2025.\n\n### AAVE Buy and Distribute program\n\nThe protocol still has substantial AAVE reserves. The closing of the LEND chapter will significantly contribute to these reserves. Nevertheless, we believe it's crucial to begin the journey toward long-term sustainability of the DAO's AAVE budget.\n\nThis proposal gives mandate to Tokenlogic to provide token approvals to the AFC during their monthly treasury management AIPs, allowing the AFC to execute and/or work with market makers to buy AAVE tokens on secondary markets and distribute them to the ecosystem reserve.\n\nAfter the initial six-month period, Tokenlogic will include a quarterly buyback budget in their treasury management reports. They will size these buybacks according to the protocol's overall budget, with the objective to eventually match—and even surpass—all protocol AAVE spending. These budgets will then be converted into token approvals for the AFC to execute the buybacks.\n\nDuring the Aavenomics TEMP CHECK phase, it was stated that a conservative approach would be to always keep in the collector's contracts an amount equivalent to 2× the \"OPEX\" or Aave service providers' & incentives budget for the DAO to mitigate treasury risk in case of a prolonged market downturn and reduced protocol revenue.\n\nThe service providers' budget is expected to evolve in 2025. Half of the 2024 budget went to support Aave Labs for the creation of V4—this large investment is not meant to be renewed in 2025. While we expect some compensation inflation from other service providers, we believe a $40–45M total budget (outside umbrella & buyback financing) is a credible conservative higher range scenario for the 2025 budget.\n\nWhile staying extremely conservative with Aave treasury funds, the ACI considers this proposal can mandate the AFC to **start an AAVE buyback and distribute program immediately at the pace of $1M/week for the first 6 months of the mandate**. With new upcoming revenue during 2025 from various sources, the AFC will likely be able to increase the buyback budget via a subsequent proposal.\n\nTokenlogic has a mandate to define the tokens used to finance these buybacks according to Aave treasury holdings on a month-to-month basis.\n\n## Specification\n\nThis proposal can largely be executed in a single AIP, though not entirely. It provides an official mandate for committee creation and expands the ALC's scope. Execution will continue through Treasury management AIPs and AFC execution. However, ending the GHO discount and implementing Anti-GHO might require additional development and audit time depending on service providers' feedback. These elements will likely be implemented in a separate \"Aavenomics Part Two\" proposal.\n\nThe specification for this first part of the Aavenomics implementation includes the following key technical components:\n\n### Technical Implementation Details\n\n1. **Aave Finance Committee Creation**: Establish a 4-member committee with a 3/4 signature threshold consisting of Chaos Labs, Tokenlogic, Llamarisk, and ACI. \n2. Give mandate to Tokenlogic to implement financing of the proposed budget for the first 6 months of the Aavenomics via monthly treasury management proposals and setting token approval allowances.\n3. **AAVE Secondary Liquidity Restructuring**: Gradually reduce the current StkBPT rewards in favor of a hybrid approach combining StkBPT staking (with no slashing element) with defined liquidity targets and partial budget allocation and distribution via AIP allowances dedicated monthly to the Liquidity Committee.\n4. **Protocol Revenue Redistribution**: Deprecate the current StkAAVE slashing element entirely, maintain AAVE rewards, and implement a system to distribute 50% of GHO protocol revenue to StkAAVE & StkBPT stakers using the Merit/MASIv framework with Anti-GHO. Anti-GHO will be distributed monthly in sync with Merit Rewards.\n5. **Buy and Distribute Program**: Mandate the AFC to leverage Treasury management token allowances to acquire AAVE on secondary markets and/or through MM partners, then send acquired tokens to the ecosystem reserve. The program will start with a $1M/week AAVE acquisition for the first 6 months, after which it will be sized according to the overall protocol budget with quarterly reporting.\n\nAccording to service provider feedback, especially @bgdlab, this might be implemented during an \"Aavenomics Part Two\" proposal to allow time for development and audit of these new features.\n\n1. **Anti-GHO Implementation**: Create a non-transferable ERC20 token that:\n    - Is generated by AAVE Umbrella Stakers through the Merit/MASIv system\n    - Can be burned at a 1:1 ratio against GHO debt\n    - Can be converted to StkGHO (eligible for Merit & other incentives)\n    - Will replace the current GHO discount mechanism\n  \n2. **LEND Migration Closure**: Remove all remaining AAVE from the LEND migration contract and redirect these tokens to the ecosystem reserve, formally ending the migration process after nearly five years.\n\nThe key objectives of these specifications are to optimize the DAO's AAVE distribution, improve secondary liquidity management efficiency, formalize the LEND deprecation, implement a sustainable revenue distribution model, and establish a pathway toward long-term sustainability of the DAO's AAVE budget.\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThe ACI and its team hold significant staked and unstaked GHO and AAVE positions and will directly benefit from this AIP alongside, and equally to, all GHO and AAVE holders.\n\nThe ACI is not presenting this ARFC on behalf of any third party and is not compensated for creating this ARFC.\n\n### **Acknowledgments**\n\nThe ACI extends its sincere gratitude to all Aave service providers, delegates, and community members who contributed to this proposal's peer review. Your expertise and insights have been invaluable in refining and strengthening this proposal. Special thanks to @BgdLabs for their crucial input on this proposal and the conception of the Umbrella Safety module. This proposal reflects the collaborative spirit and dedication of the Aave DAO.\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. Invite community & service providers to provide feedback on this proposal with the goal of reaching consensus.\n2. If consensus is reached on this ARFC, escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n3. If the Snapshot outcome is YAE, give a mandate for the creation of committees, increase the scope of the current ones, and implement the rest of the proposal via AIP.\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.\n\n![image|1280x776](upload://j3cVg2xqAr1ArEjmQTZxrbgjfCB.jpeg)",
