        "body": "---\n### [TEMP CHECK] Onboard tBTC to Aave v3 on Ethereum, Arbitrum and Optimism\n\n### **Author:  @Ethan - Threshold Network Growth Coordinator**\n\n### **Date: 2024-04-24**\n\n---\n\n## **Summary**\nThe proposal aims to onboard Threshold Network’s tBTC, to the Aave v3 protocol on Ethereum, Arbitrum and Optimism. tBTC is backed one-to-one with Bitcoin.\n\n## Motivation/Background:\n\ntBTC is Threshold’s decentralized and permissionless bridge to bring BTC to the Ethereum network. tBTC has been designed to allow Bitcoin holders to participate in Ethereum's Decentralized Finance (DeFi) applications. Users wishing to utilize their Bitcoin on Ethereum can use the tBTC decentralized bridge to deposit their Bitcoin into the system and get a minted tBTC token in their Ethereum wallet.\n\nHaving recently acquired a Chainlink oracle, tBTC enables Aave users to have access to the only wrapped Bitcoin, which can be permissionlessly minted and redeemed, where the BTC that backs it is not held by a central intermediary, but is instead held by a decentralized network of nodes using threshold cryptography. This implies a fully decentralized and permissionless lending and borrowing experience for BTC (i.e. bridge native BTC to tBTC and borrow via Aave).\n\nBenefits for Aave:\n\n* Further decentralization and trust minimisation in the Aave stack.\n* A range of lending options for those who wish to earn yield on their BTC.\n* Collaboration with the Threshold Network DAO, opening up the opportunity to incorporate other Threshold products (such as Threshold Access Control and thUSD) into the Aave offering.\n* Preferable yields on tBTC through active incentive participation, boosting Aave protocol use, fees and TVL.\n* Additional incentive allocation originating from Arbitrium's LTIPP.\n\n## Specification\n\nTicker: TBTC\nContract Addresses:\n\nEthereum: 0x18084fba666a33d37592fa2633fd49a74dd93a88\n\nArbitrum: 0x6c84a8f1c29108f47a79964b5fe888d4f4d0de40\n\nOptimism: 0x6c84a8f1c29108F47a79964b5Fe888D4f4D0dE40\n\nChainlink Oracle:\n\nEthereum: 0x8350b7De6a6a2C1368E7D4Bd968190e13E354297\n\nArbitrum: 0xE808488e8627F6531bA79a13A9E0271B39abEb1C\n\nOptimism: 0x5a61374950D4BFa5a3D4f2CA36FC1d23A92b6f21\n\nUseful Links (the number of posted links is limited to 5 for new users, hence the intended spacing between \"h\" and \"ttps\"):\n\nProject: h ttps://www.threshold.network/\n\nMinting dashboard: h ttps://dashboard.threshold.network/tBTC/mint\n\nGitHub: h ttps://github.com/keep-network/tbtc-v2\n\nDocs: h ttps://docs.threshold.network/applications/tbtc-v2\n\nAudit: h ttps://threshold.network/about#audits\n\nImmunfi Bug Bounty: h ttps://immunefi.com/bounty/thresholdnetwork/\n\nLlama Risk Report: https://hackmd.io/@LlamaRisk/tBTC\n\nTwitter: h ttps://twitter.com/thetnetwork\n\nDiscord: h ttps://discord.gg/threshold\n\nDune: h ttps://dune.com/threshold/tbtc & h ttps://dune.com/sensecapital/tbtc-liquidity\n\n\n#### What is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset?\n\nThreshold Network has no link and is not compensated to present this TEMP CHECK proposal.\n\n#### Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token.\n\ntBTC is a decentralized wrapped Bitcoin that is 1:1 backed by native BTC. Unlike other wrapped Bitcoins, the BTC that backs tBTC is not held by a central intermediary, but is instead held by a decentralized network of nodes using threshold cryptography.\n\ntBTC is trust minimized and redeemable for native BTC without a centralized custodian. It can be used across the entire DeFi ecosystem.\n\ntBTC can be used as collateral, liquidity, a store of value, and can be integrated with DeFi apps across all supported blockchains.\n\nAs with other BTC wrappers, tBTC provides cryptocurrency traders and general users with a BTC-pegged token, that can be used to generate yield whilst holding native BTC.\n\n#### Explain the positioning of the token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset?\n\nAdding support for tBTC on Aave V3 as an asset would allow tBTC holders to obtain a yield on their tBTC holdings.\n\nIn Aave’s [document hub](https://docs.aave.com/hub/), the first line self-describes Aave as “a decentralized non-custodial liquidity protocol”, Threshold Network is looking to help Aave fully realise this by allowing access to tBTC, which unlike its centralized competitor (wBTC), is the only way to permissionlessly borrow and lend BTC in a decentralized manner. This gives Aave direct access to the 1.3 trillion market and 106 million owners of BTC, for which wBTC provides limited access to.\n\n#### Provide a brief history of the project and the different components: DAO (is it live?), products (are they live?). How did it overcome some of the challenges it faced?\n\ntBTC was created by a decentralized effort of contributors at the Threshold Network DAO, and extensively utilizes the Threshold Network’s threshold cryptography to create a secure BTC asset. tBTC is a product launched on Threshold Network, on which many other decentralized applications are being built.\n\nThreshold Network DAO was born out of the first on-chain merger between two decentralized protocols, Keep Network and NuCypher early in 2022. The DAO has successfully operated since that time, and supports an active community of contributors that work towards building tBTC liquidity and usability.\n\n#### How is tBTC currently used?\n\ntBTC is currently used across the Ethereum, Arbitrum, Base, Optimism, Polygon and Solana ecosystems. tBTC exhibits strong usecase across decentralized exchanges, lending on Solana and Bitcoin Options on Base and as collateral for crvUSD, a broad overview can be found here:\nhttps://defillama.com/yields?token=TBTC\n\n#### Emission schedule\n\ntBTC is one-to-one backed with real Bitcoin, meaning that there isn’t an emissions schedule, but a mint and redeem function that adjusts the supply of tBTC based on native BTC coming into and out of the system.\n\n#### Token (& Protocol) permissions (minting) and upgradability. Is there a multisig? What can it do? Who are the signers?\n\nFor tBTC, wallets are created periodically based on governance. In order for the wallet to move funds, it produces signatures using a Threshold Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm, requiring 51-of-100 Signers to cooperate. The 100 signers on each wallet are chosen with our Sortition Pool, and the randomness is provided by the Random Beacon. More can be found here - https://docs.threshold.network/applications/tbtc-v2/wallet-generation\n\nThe Threshold Council multisig is a 6/9 Gnosis Safe multisig with 9 unique signers that form the Threshold Network Council. The Council has limited upgrade privileges over the smart contracts. However, those privileges do not include any custodial power over deposited BTC:\n\nCouncil Multisig Ethereum Address: 0x9F6e831c8F8939DC0C830C6e492e7cEf4f9C2F5f\n\n#### Market data (Market Cap, 24h Volume, Volatility, Exchanges, Maturity)\n\nMarket capitalisation: $195,000,000 USD / 2,960 BTC\nDecentralized exchange liquidity pools: h ttps://defillama.com/yields?token=TBTC\nDashboard on Decentralized LP liquidity: h ttps://dune.com/sensecapital/tbtc-liquidity\n\n#### Social channels data (Size of communities, activity on Github)\n\nDiscord: 7,251\nTwitter: 37,200\nGithub: 4,596 commits\nContracts date of deployments, number of transactions, number of holders for tokens\nDate of Deployment: February 2023\nNumber of transactions: 27,986\nNumber of token holders: 756\n\n#### Risk parameters\n\nWhile we suggest the community to wait for the feedback from risks teams, we suggest the following risk parameters to start the conversation.\n\nSymbol: TBTC\n\nContract Addresses\n\nEthereum: 0x18084fba666a33d37592fa2633fd49a74dd93a88\n\nArbitrum: 0x6c84a8f1c29108f47a79964b5fe888d4f4d0de40\n\nOptimism: 0x6c84a8f1c29108F47a79964b5Fe888D4f4D0dE40\n\n|Parameter|Value|\n| --- | --- |\n|Isolation Mode|No|\n|Borrowable|Yes|\n|Collateral Enabled|Yes|\n|Supply Cap|N/A|\n|Borrow Cap|2 Million USD|\n|Debt Ceiling|N/A|\n|LTV|35%|\n|LT|78%|\n|Liquidation Bonus|5.00%|\n|Liquidation Protocol Fee|10.00%|\n\n## Disclaimer:\n\nThis proposal is powered by Threshold Network.

        "body": "---\n\nTitle: [TEMP CHECK] Add FXS to Ethereum V3\nAuthor: 0xlide\nDate: 2023-09-21\n\n---\n\n## Summary\nThis TEMP CHECK presents the community with the opportunity to add FXS to the Ethereum v3 Liquidity Pool.\n\n## Motivation\nFrax Finance consists of a Stable-Protocol issuing Frax, FPI, FrxETH and Sub-Protocols such as Fraxlend, Fraxswap, Fraxferry, etc. Frax Shares Token ($FXS) is Frax Finance's Govenance Token & Utility Token.\n\nAave may facilitate diversification of GHO collateral by adding FXS. Also, FXS earned as revenue from the Aave V3 pool can be $veFXS as a new strategic asset to be used as a boost trap for GHO and/or new aToken adoption.\n\n## Specifications\n**What is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset?**\n0xLide have no link and are not compensated to present this TEMP CHECK proposal\n\n**Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token.**\nFrax Finance operates three stablecoins, $FRAX (USD peg), $FPI (US CPI peg) frxETH (LST and ETH peg), and sub-protocols Fraxlend (lending) Fraxswap (DEX) and Fraxferry (bridge). As of September 12, DeFiLlama's Protocol TVL Ranking is #17.\n\nFrax Shares Token ($FXS) is Frax Finance's Govenance Token & Utility Token. There is a possibility of deflation. It also uses Curve's veCRV mechanism for its vesting and yield system, which can be used to specify the gauge and boost the yield.\n\n**Explain the positioning of the token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset?**\nFXS is suitable as an asset to be listed in Aave V3 and can be similar to BAL, SNX, CRV, etc. Also, FXS earned as revenue from the Aave V3 pool can be $veFXS as a new strategic asset to be used as a boost trap for GHO and/or new aToken adoption.\n\n**Provide a brief history of the project and the different components: DAO (is it live?), products (are the live?). How did it overcome some of the challenges it faced?**\n\nFXS is a non-stable, utility token of Frax Ecosystem and retains rights to governance and all utilities of the Ecosystem. The following are the main products and concepts of the Frax Ecosystem:\n\nFRAX (USD Stablecoin): world's first decentralized stablecoin with parts of its supply collateralized and parts algorithmic stabilized Frax V2, launched in Q4 2021, introduces the idea of an \"Algorithmic Market Operations Controller\" (AMO), dramatically improving scalability and profitability. Frax V3, which introduces RWA, is scheduled to be launched in the near future.\n\nFrax Pirce Index: Stablecoin, an inflation-linked currency linked to the CPI-U unadjusted 12 month inflation rate published by the US federal government. *FPI growth is also linked to FRAX growth and FXS is designed to benefit from them.\n\nfrxETH and sfrxETH (ETH peg): $ETH Liquid Staking Derivative Service launched in October 2022; as of September 2023, it is third in market capitalization behind Lido and RocketPool with approximately $4.2m Dollar. The upcoming frxETH V2 is expected to be more decentralized, changing the Validator from Permissionless to Permissionless while maintaining high profitability.\n\nFraxswap, a native AMM: Fraxswap is the first AMM with time weighted average market maker orders used by the Frax Protocol for rebalancing collateral, mints/redemptions, expanding/contracting stablecoin supply, and deploying protocol owned liquidity onchain.\n\nFraxlend, permissionless lending markets: Fraxlend is the lending facility for Frax-based stablecoins allowing debt origination, customized non-custodial loans, and onboarding collateral assets to the Frax Finance economy.\n\nFraxferry, optimistic transfer protocol for Frax-based tokens: Fraxferry transfers natively issued Frax Protocol tokens across many blockchains.\n\nGauge Rewards System – The community can propose new gauge rewards for strategies that integrate Frax-based stablecoins. FXS emissions are fixed, halve each year, and entirely flow to different gauges based on the votes of veFXS stakers.\n\n**How is the asset currently used?**\nAs of September 17, [73.9% of FXS are unlocked](https://token.unlocks.app/frax-share). About [50.8% have been staked as veFXS for an average of 1.84 years](https://app.frax.finance/vefxs) and can be used for Gauge boost. Convex, Pitch, StakeDAO, etc. exist as [Liquid Wrappers](https://www.defiwars.xyz/wars/frax).\n\n**Emission Schedule**\nThe total supply of FXS is 100million FXS, with 60% distributed to liquidity programs (such as Gauge boost Reward) which halves every 12 months, 5% to DAO Treasury, and 35% to Team and investors. 35% (35millionFXS) applied to Team and investors has been unlocked as of July 2022. As of July 2022, the unlocking of the 35% (35millionFXS) allocated to Team and investors has been completed.\n\nFXS supply is initially set to 100 million tokens at genesis, but the amount in circulation will likely be deflationary as FRAX is minted at higher algorithmic ratios. The design of the protocol is such that FXS would be largely deflationary in supply as long as FRAX demand grows.\n\n**Token (& Protocol) permissions (minting) and upgradability. Is there a multisig?

        "body": "## Author: ACI\n\n## Date: 13/09/2024\n\n# Summary\n\n[Superlend](https://www.superlend.xyz/) is building a lending and borrowing aggregator platform that allows users to manage their positions across multiple chains and protocols, always accessing the best APRs for lending and the lowest rates for borrowing. The Superlend project was Initially conceived during the [Etherlink Accelerator in Singapore](https://medium.com/etherlink/the-future-of-defi-insights-from-dca-in-singapore-d543477cdbe6) as a lending and borrowing platform on [Etherlink](https://www.etherlink.com/).\n\nSuperlend's goals include launching their own dedicated money markets using the Aave V3 codebase on Etherlink and Arbitrum, while also integrating Aave V3 markets already deployed by the Aave DAO across the EVM ecosystem, such as on Ethereum, Base, and Polygon, into their aggregator. For the Arbitrum deployment, they are planning to deploy an instance of Aave V3 that will exclusively support ETH and ETH-correlated assets (such as LRTs and LSTs), similar to Aave's Lido instance on Ethereum. These deployments and integrations will enable users to seamlessly manage their positions within the robust and secure Aave framework, while also allowing Superlend to offer innovative cross-chain liquidity management features. Additional details for the Arbitrum proposal will be provided in the future as they finalize the risk parameters and asset selection. Leveraging Aave's well-audited and secure infrastructure allows them to accelerate their development without compromising on security, avoiding the complexities and costs associated with building from scratch.\n\nIn recognition of the value provided by the Aave community, Superlend proposes a revenue-sharing model, committing to share 15% of the revenue generated from these markets with the Aave DAO.\n\n# Motivation\n\nThe Aave V3 codebase has established itself as a cornerstone in the DeFi ecosystem, renowned for its reliability, security, and quality. Successful projects like the Spark Protocol and RealT further affirm Aave's technology and reputation. Superlend's objectives are twofold: launching their own innovative money markets using the Aave V3 codebase on Etherlink and Arbitrum, and integrating the various Aave V3 markets already deployed by the Aave DAO across the EVM ecosystem (such as those on Ethereum and Polygon) into their aggregator. For the Arbitrum deployment, they plan to deploy an instance of Aave V3 focused exclusively on ETH and ETH-correlated assets, similar to the Lido instance that Aave has deployed on Ethereum. By doing so, they aim to provide users with a cohesive experience that leverages the strength of Aave's framework while also showcasing the unique features and innovations that Superlend can bring to the market.\n\nOne of Superlend's other motivations for deploying on Etherlink and Arbitrum-like chains using the Aave V3 codebase is to enable a feature for their aggregator that allows users to keep their USDC in the best APY protocol across chains with a single click. After extensive testing with the LayerZero-like cross-chain protocol Across+, as well as flash-loan scripts, they discovered that integrating an Aave deployment with the Portal feature activated, along with a third-party bridge provider, could allow users to move their USDC positions from Compound on Arbitrum to Aave on Optimism seamlessly. In this scenario, Superlend markets can serve as a \"temporary station\" where liquidity is parked for a few seconds during the transfer. Before making such a feature live, they would, of course, share it first in the forum and seek feedback when it's ready.\n\nSuperlend's vision aligns with deploying \"friendly\" forks of Aave V3, customized for specific use cases and ecosystems, and integrating these Aave V3 deployments by the Aave DAO as a prominent part of their aggregator. Keeping the open-source ethos at the forefront, they believe it is fair and respectful to seek the Aave community's approval first, ensuring a mutually beneficial path forward for both Aave and Superlend.\n\nAs Aave continues to explore areas like off-chain collateral and new developments such as GHO, projects like Superlend have the opportunity to add value and drive the adoption of Aave's technology. Their proposal to deploy an Aave V3 fork on Etherlink and Arbitrum represents a strategic opportunity to extend Aave's influence within the rapidly evolving cross-chain DeFi landscape. In appreciation of this opportunity, they propose a revenue-sharing model to ensure mutual benefit from this collaboration.\n\nSuperlend has confirmed plans to allocate a portion of its community token supply towards a potential airdrop or distribution specifically for stkAAVE holders, and they wish to leverage the existing set of holders and delegates, aligning with AAVE DAO's governance model. Specific details will be announced closer to the event. Currently, Superlend's priority remains product development and refinement.\n\n# Specification\n\n### Market Deployment\n\n- **Aave V3 Codebase:** Superlend will deploy their money markets on Etherlink and Arbitrum using the Aave V3 codebase. For the Arbitrum deployment, they plan to focus exclusively on ETH and ETH-correlated assets, similar to Aave's Lido instance on Ethereum. Additionally, there could be a second market on Arbitrum dedicated to USDC or similar assets to support their cross-chain liquidity management feature, which would use the Aave Portal feature. These markets will operate independently from their aggregator platform but will be fully integrated within the Superlend ecosystem. These deployments are integral to both their goal of launching innovative Superlend markets and their broader strategy to integrate the existing Aave V3 markets deployed by the Aave DAO across the EVM ecosystem (e.g., on Ethereum and Polygon) into their aggregator.\n    - Test their proposed deployment that they have live on Etherlink testnet [here](https://testnet.superlend.xyz/).\n    - Find the addresses of their deployed contracts on the testnet [here](https://www.notion.so/Testnet-deploy-sequence-addresses-fd6c3707ece94aabab61d8498a638775?pvs=21).\n- **Revenue Sharing:** Superlend proposes sharing 15% of the revenue generated from these markets with the Aave DAO, provided that their quarterly revenue exceeds $200,000. These contributions will be made on a quarterly basis.\n\n### Governance and Risk Management\n\n- **Governance Model:** Initially, the markets will be governed through a 5/8 multi-sig model. As the project matures, they plan to transition to a more decentralized governance structure, aligning with the principles of Aave's governance model.\n- **Risk Management:** Superlend has partnered with [ChainRisk](https://www.chainrisk.xyz/) for continuous risk parameter tuning and will onboard additional partners as needed to ensure comprehensive risk management for these markets.\n\n# Disclaimer\n\nThe ACI has not been compensated for the publication of this proposal.\n\n# Next Steps\n\n1. If consensus is reached on the ARFC, escalate the proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n2. If the Snapshot outcome is favorable, Superlend markets will be deployed on Etherlink and Arbitrum, adhering to the revenue-sharing and governance commitments outlined.\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.",

There are several types of votes in other communities which are high context and time sensitive that can not be automated.\n\nAave would benefit from optimizing these resources in the most efficient way (i.e: Avoid Curve & Balancer gauges votes weekly on the Aave snapshot and/or management by AIP), and this publication presents the community with an opportunity to establish a voting framework and electing a voting committee.\n\nHow the committee is to vote wouldl be determined by an overall global strategy that is agreed/voted upon, by Aave governance.\n\n# Rationale:\n\nAs a reminder, veBAL positions offer the following benefits:\n\n* Gauge-weight Power: Voting power which influences emissions on the gauges.\n\n* Governance Power: Voting power in the DAO proposals\n\n* veBoost: Holding veBAL earns a boost up to 2.5x on the liquidity provided.\n\n* Protocol Fees: Part of the trading fees sold for bb-a-USD and claimable by lockers.\n\nThis proposal assumes that the veBAL position will be locked from the collector contract, and aims to define how these benefits should be managed.\n\n## Managing strategic assets on Collector Contract\n\nMost of the strategic assets are held on the Reserve Factor Mainnet, which is also where the treasury strategies will be deployed, so it makes sense to focus the whitelist proposals on this contract: `0x464C71f6c2F760DdA6093dCB91C24c39e5d6e18c` (which is the same for v2 and v3).\n\nHowever, DAO process are changing from one project to another, which can create incompatibilities:\n\n* Aave Governance is fully on-chain and only focused on protocols decisions, requiring most proposal to be approved by an AIP (which usually takes more than 1 week to be implemented)\n\n* Balancer Governance is also different (up to 1 year lock), governance power is off-chain, veBoost, gauge power and protocol fees claim are on-chain.\n\nMain benefits\n\n* bb-a-USD & BAL claim function from veBAL rewards is easy to add & automate on the collector contract\n* Governance is off-chain, and can be delegated via Snapshot.\n* veBoost can be utilized.\n* Aave holds a bigger supply share than CRV holdings\n\nMain issues\n\n* It’s not possible to delegate the gauge power on-chain which means that the collector contract would need to cast a new vote each time the veBAL allocation on gauges is updated.\n* New functions should be added on the collector contract to claim BAL from several gauges.where the Treasury could deposit.\n* As the voting power linearly decreases, the position requires to be relocked frequently to retain the max benefits. This part can be automated by Llama.\n* The potential locked holdings would represent ~1,48% of the veBAL supply (good but not enough to sustain Aave DAO various plans mentioned in Part IV)\n\nMoreover, the DAO could decide to allocate some funds on Balancer/Aura to optimize the yield, so these protocols should also be accessible from the reserve factor contract.\n\n### Collector Contract Considerations\n\nAs it would be very inefficient to require AIP for each transaction, this option considers whitelisting the voting committee to manage the strategic positions on the collector contract from the multisig.\n\nThis solution keeps the decentralized ethos of the Aave DAO but is also the most complex to implement than simply delegating the management of the assets to the committee multisig.\n\n* Implement all missing functions to interact with strategic protocols contracts such as Balancer/Aura, allowing to lock / periodically relock, claim, stake/unstake, updateBoost, add/remove liquidity, cast/update gauge votes\n* Elect the voting committee and create the associated multisig\n* Implement whitelists on the collector contract allowing the voting committee to handle the operations without requiring AIP for each transaction\n\n### Voting Committee\n\nThe voting committee would manage the following tasks by having its multisig whitelisted on the collector contract:\n\n* Lock/Relock the veTokens positions\n* Cast votes on gauges\n* Claim protocol fees\n* Claim gauges rewards\n* Update/sell veBoost\n* Follow the strategy profitability\n* Optimize amounts and create votes incentives\n* Claim unspent rewards & DAO vote incentives\n* Compound all strategic assets\n* Transfer all yield (or remaining yield to the collector contract)\n\n# Technical Implementation\n\n* Elect the voting committee\n* Deploy the multisig\n\n# Voting Options\n\nYAE - Proceed with Committee\n\nNAE - No Committee\n\nABSTAIN\n\n# Disclaimer\n\nThe Llama is not compensated by any of the mentioned communities outside of Aave.\n\nLlama is an unpaid delegate within the Balancer ecosystem. Some members of Llama are unpaid delegates in the Paladin ecosystem.\n\nMembers who contributed to this proposal are not angel investors or advisors to any of the mentioned communities but some do hold small holdings in those communities tokens.\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n\n# References\n\n1.

        "body": "---\nTitle: [TEMP CHECK] Further Aave v1 deprecation strategy\n\nAuthor: BGD Labs @bgdlabs\n\nDate: 2024-01-09\n\n---\n\n## Summary\nApprove further steps of Aave v1 off-boarding, to reduce operational overhead on deprecated Aave instances.\n\n\n## Motivation\nThe Aave protocol v1 was released in January 2020 and eventually superseded by Aave protocol v2 in December on the same year.\n\nWhile Aave v1 has been deprecated for a long time, some liquidity is still stuck on the protocol 1. Even if this instance is not covered by the Aave Safety Module, being part of Aave, it still is monitored and evaluated whenever development and/or security decisions are made.\n\nThis creates meaningful overhead for all involved development & security teams, which directly adds cost to the Aave DAO. Additionally, the architecture of Aave v1 is quite different to Aave v2 & v3, making it the most ad-hoc instance of Aave.\n\nFor the previous reasons, we think the community should evaluate approving extra off-boarding steps.\n\n\n## Specification\nTo achieve a complete off-boarding of Aave v1, the following needs to be completed:\n\n- All debt has to be settled, in order to allow liquidity providers on v1 to withdraw.\n- All assets have to be withdrawn.\n\nTo minimise the impact on users we propose a phased approach, where each phase could last in the order of 1-3 weeks.\n\n### Phase 1\nIn a first phase we recommend to upgrade the liquidation mechanism on the protocol in the following ways:\n\n- It should no longer be possible to receive aTokens for liquidations (as the goal is to remove liquidity, not transfer it from user to user).\n- It should be possible to liquidate healthy (collateralised) positions with a fixed liquidationBonus (e.g. 1%). This value should be small to not hurt borrowers, while still being big enough to incentivise liquidations. If this Temp Check is successful, we will confirm the number with risk providers., but 1% at the current moment would make the liquidation profitable for approximately 85% of the positions to liquidate.\n- It should be possible to liquidate a entire position at once (currently on Aave v1 only 50% of a position can be liquidated).\n- Interest rates should be lowered to the minimum, as the previously described always-enabled dynamics remove any need of utilisation dynamics.\n- Remove flash loan fee, as there should not be extra incentives for liquidity providers.\n\n### Phase 2\nIn a second phase we recommend increasing the fixed liquidationBonus to a higher percentage.\n\nThe exact number must be chosen based on current market conditions to minimise user impact, but allow economical liquidations.\n\n### Phase 3\nOnce the big majority of debt is repaid, we recommend to introduce a forced withdrawal mechanism. With forced withdrawals anybody could withdraw on behalf of any liquidity provider on Aave v1, with the funds received by the holder of the aToken.\n\nIt is important to clarify that further technical aspects on this should be analysed before executing this step, for example smart contracts receiving funds without triggering a withdrawal.\n\n---\n\nAfter all the Phases are finished, additional ad-hoc steps can be executed, like Rescue Mission for locked funds.\n\n\n## Next Steps\n\nIf this TEMP CHECK is approved, we will proceed with an ARFC, with the final steps including feedback from risk service providers, and precise technical decisions.\n\nFinally, AIPs will be created for the different phases.\n\n\n## Copyright\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0 .",
