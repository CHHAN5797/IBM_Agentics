This proposal recommends updating the mainnet Arc market LTV parameter to match the LiquidationThreshold of the same asset listed on mainnet V2 market.\n\nWe intend to re-propose a quarterly update of the risk parameters for the mainnet Arc market quarterly in an attempt to keep both markets in sync with mainnet V2 market, or mainnet V3 once live.\n\n# Motivation\n\nThis risk parameter change is targeting the following improvements on the Aave Arc Market:\n\n* Align Risk Parameters - The risk parameters on Aave Arc market are currently more conservative and are in need of being updated to better reflect the mainnet V2 market and also the risk profile of the user.\n* Improve UX - Increasing LTV ratios and reducing the Liquidity Penalty enables greater capital efficiency across the market.\n\nGiven the extra precaution shown when approving Borrowers on the Aave Arc Market, the recommendation is to amend the LTV to reflect the risk profiles of market participants. For now, the intent is to maintain the mainnet Arc market in line with the mainent V2 market on a quarterly basis.\n\n# Specification\n\nThe below table shows the assets listed on the mainnet Arc market and their respective risk parameters on the mainnet Arc market.\n\n![Screenshot 2022-04-10 at 13.51.24.png](ipfs://QmW2GXLNVMV5o61TT2hLesLpd1KuB1eoqjD6Q8K6Qixv2B)\n\nThe below table shows the assets listed on the mainnet Arc market and their respective risk parameters on the Aave V2 market. This is for comparison purposes only.\n\n![Screenshot 2022-04-10 at 13.53.12.png](ipfs://QmVXnEEicadDjjbKQbxVWRoHmwXGFc3U6hvvzjF3MSSwhs)\n\nThe below table shows the assets listed on the mainnet Arc market and the proposed risk parameters.\n\n![Screenshot 2022-04-10 at 13.53.40.png](ipfs://QmSBZym1PLqXtNCnbqVEPF4Uswph6Qcboy7y2diyTQmXpD)\n\n# Voting\n\nFOR:\n\nDO Update the risk parameters on mainnet Arc market as per mainet V2 market\n\nAGAINST:\n\nDO NOT change the existing arrangement.\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n\n",

The final proposal will reflect the discussion on the governance forum.\n\naip: TBA\ntitle: ARC - Continue Liquidity Mining Program on Aave V2 Ethereum market and Initiate Liquidity Mining on Aave ARC market\nstatus: Proposal\nauthor: @MatthewGraham, @3SE_Holdings, @4lex.eth\ncreated: 03.02.2022\nDiscussion: https://governance.aave.com/t/aave-v2-liquidity-mining-program-aave-v2-ethereum-market-and-aave-arc-market/7189\n\n----\n\n# Simple Summary\n\nThis ARC presents the community with the opportunity to continue offering stkAAVE incentives on Aave V2 Ethereum market for an additional 90 days from when [AIP-47](https://app.aave.com/#/governance/47-QmRTKqSJCMKysQonSHdxkawei78NmHe1aq6yAjDmWUPgqH) finishes at a further 30% reduced rate.\n\nIn addition to tapering incentives on the Aave V2 market, the ARC proposes introducing incentives on the Aave ARC market. 10% of the 30% reduction in incentives on the Aave V2 ethereum market are to be applied to incentivising AUM on the Aave ARC Ethereum market.\n\n# Abstract\n\nLiquidity mining incentives were introduced to Aave V2 on the 26th April 2021 via [AIP-16](https://app.aave.com/#/governance/11-Qmf1JeXiw8BDUoKJ89VmUJ8wy22D2udqL4HxprCG7DZ5zG), renewed by [AIP-32](https://app.aave.com/#/governance/28-QmWaac9UwQuiBtsGpm4oG6TwnVd86DWfqtVV8f11y5ZM5E) and then incentives were reduced by 30% with the implementation of [AIP-47](https://app.aave.com/#/governance/47-QmRTKqSJCMKysQonSHdxkawei78NmHe1aq6yAjDmWUPgqH) which expires on the 20th February 2022. A summary is shown below.\n\n* [AIP-16](https://app.aave.com/#/governance/11-Qmf1JeXiw8BDUoKJ89VmUJ8wy22D2udqL4HxprCG7DZ5zG): 2,200 stkAAVE per day from 26th Apr 2021 on Aave V2 Ethereum market\n* [AIP-32](https://app.aave.com/#/governance/28-QmWaac9UwQuiBtsGpm4oG6TwnVd86DWfqtVV8f11y5ZM5E): [2,200 stkAAVE per day](https://app.aave.com/#/governance/28-QmWaac9UwQuiBtsGpm4oG6TwnVd86DWfqtVV8f11y5ZM5E) from 24th Aug 2021 on Aave V2 Ethereum market\n* [AIP-47](https://app.aave.com/#/governance/47-QmRTKqSJCMKysQonSHdxkawei78NmHe1aq6yAjDmWUPgqH): 1,540 stkAAVE per day from 22nd Nov 2021 on Aave V2 Ethereum market\n* AIP-X: 1,078 stkAAVE per day from 21st Feb 2022 on Aave V2 Ethereum market\n* AIP-X: 46.2 stkAAVE per day from 21st Feb 2022 on Aave V2 Ethereum market\n\nContinuing on from AIP-47, incentives on low vol assets are to be split 1:2 in favour of borrowers over lenders. This logic will be applied to both Aave V2 and ARC markets. High vol assets will only receive lending incentives and this is skewed to favour more recently listed assets and communities that have a strategic relationship with Aave, like Balancer and Chainlink.\n\n# Motivation\n\nThis proposal continues on from AIP-47 with a further 30% tapering of incentives which was directionally communicated in the prior [ARC](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-aave-v2-liquidity-mining-program-90-days-at-30-reduced-rate/5946) and shall last for another proposed 90 day period. We will continue with the same rationale for how incentives are distributed across the Aave V2 Ethereum market.\n\nThe incentive APR will fall, even though TVL has reduced with market conditions so has AAVE’s token price.\n\nIn addition to incentivising Aave V2 Ethereum market, I would like to present to the community an opportunity to commence distributing stkAAVE incentives on the Aave ARC market with the intention of achieving the following:\n\n1. Grow Total Value Locked (TVL)\n2. Increase liquidity\n3. Attractive (low) borrow rates\n4. Increase the protocol income via growing the Reserve Factor\n5. Redistribute governance power towards users of the platform\n\nWithin this proposal we will present two options for the Aave ARC markets, Option 2) will reflect a Total Value Locked in Aave ARC of $250M. This represents a 12.6x increase in TVL from what is a low base. The next iteration of liquidity mining will likely see an increased allocation to Aave ARC as we continue to encourage users to interact with the market. The initial target here is to grow Aave ARV to over $250M within the next 90 days and then pivot as required to support continual growth of the market.\n\n# Specification\n\nThe below section outlines the proposed liquidity mining incentives to be applied from 21.02.2021 up to and including 20.05.2022.\n\nKey changes from the previous liquidity mining campaign:\n\n* 30% reduction in incentives to 1,078 stkAAVE per day on Aave V2 Ethereum market\n* Introduction of 26.2 stkAAVE per day on Aave ARC Ethereum market\n* Distribution of stkAAVE is pro rata based upon deposit dollar value\n\nThe table below shows the intend stkAAVE distribution across the Aave V2 Ethereum market asset listings. In estimating the Borrowing vAPR, a 75% utilisation of the deposited assets was assumed. This was based on the current DAI utilisation.\n\n![|464x287](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/aave/optimized/2X/d/d2ff417f056b6dd50b32d389b8167c92d86a39d4_2_1380x984.png \"Chart\")\nNote: TVL per token is as per the 3rd February 2022.\n\nThe table below shows the intend stkAAVE distribution across the Aave ARC market asset listings.\n\nOption 1) Same Methodology as above allocating 10% of the reduction in Aave V2 Ethereum Market stkAAVE incentives. Ie: 10% of (1,540-1,078)\n\n![|464x287](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/aave/optimized/2X/6/6bdf8f04d85d9e5f50ffe2ac1c50c278a4865a46_2_1380x248.png \"Chart\")\n\nOption 2) Similar methodology to the above with an assumed market size of $250M and distribution across the assets of 60% USDC, 20% ETH and 10% of both wBTC and AAVE.\n\nAsset Value Deposited Multiplier Daily stkAAVE Incentive LM Allocation (%) LM Incentive Split (%) LM vAPR (%)\n\n![|464x287](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/aave/optimized/2X/f/fbfed436c63b075741117d4c19a49510745aade6_2_1380x250.png \"Chart\")\n\nMathematics: % of value deposited x multiplier then scaled to provide LM Allocation that totals 100%. [Link here.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1trx6tYr1jy5Izs-IfPTrGCp1y6EExCgyu4P8pme_Y_8/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n# Rationale\n\nThe previous LM campaign indicated the ongoing tapering on the Aave V2 Ethereum market that is presented within this proposal. The introduction of incentives on Aave ARC reflects a desire to grow this mainnet market. Incentivising the Aave ARC market is funded from the reduction in incentives on the Aave V2 Ethereum market. The net incentive spend over the next 90 day period is reduced down from 1,540 to 1,124.2 stkAAVE per day.\n\nAarve ARC Option 1) we show what impact allocating 10% of the savings from the reduced Aave V2 Ethereum market would look like following a similar allocation strategy to the Aave V2 Ethereum market. The mathematics assumes 75% utilisation of lending pools capital is borrowed which reflects the current utilisation of the DAI pool on the Aave V2 Ethereum market. With zero wBTC deposited in the market, and still very low capital being deposited, this approach is heavily skewed towards USDC and mis represents what is expected with time.\n\nAave ARC Option 2) we elected to view the incentives in line with $250M and assumed a distribution across the pools. The distribution is an assumption and is quite different to the existing distribution on the Aave V2 Ethereum market. We can easily change these parameters and are happy to do so. The high level logic is to anticipate capital being deposited and then estimating what the vAPR from incentives would equate to. For this we assumed $250M which is arbitrarily chosen as a nice round target, it represents over 10x growth in the market TVL.\n\n# Discussion\n\nThe previous LM proposal provides a lot of the context and rationale to how the stkAAVE incentives are distributed across the various assets on both markets. Link [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-aave-v2-liquidity-mining-program-90-days-at-30-reduced-rate/5946). Something of interest on the Aave V2 Ethereum market, large holders currently can turn a 336 bps and 344 bps profit based on the existing emission schedule across the DAI and USDC pools by recursive borrowing. (Lending vAPY, - borrowing vAPR, + Borrowing Incentives vAPR, + Lending vAPY)\n\nWith the newly proposed emission schedule this 336 bps return minus gas becomes a 289 bps and 292 bps profit before gas. Time in the pool is also a huge factor, and those already invested in this type of strategy may continue to do so. However, it would be a lot less appealing to deploy this strategy now. Tapering the incentives reduces the profitability of recursive borrowing but not sufficiently so to support unwinding the positions. The opportunity cost becomes more something to consider.\n\nWith the introduction of incentives on Aave ARC, even with around $250M deposited 60% in USDC, the strategy would be profitable with a 75% utilisation rate. This risks assets currently deposited in the Aave V2 Ethereum market being reallocated to the Aave ARC market. If this was to occur the vAPR from incentives on the Aave V2 Ethereum market would increase. It will be interesting to see what effect this has on the value deposited in each pool. Pending how the market reacts to these proposed changes, we can always revisit this and propose an amendment to the distribution schedule across both markets.\n\n## Economics\n\n* Aave V2 Ethereum markets daily Reserve Revenue is averaging around $44.5K per day during late January 2022. Daily aToken interest is around $1.9K per day.\n* Liquidity Mining is estimated to cost $168,630 per day assuming 1,124.2 stkAAVE at $150 per token. Down from $231,000 per day assuming 1,540 stkAAVE at $150 per token. Note, previous LM was budgeted using a stkAAVE price of $320.\n* Ecosystem Reserve is worth around $296.89M with an AAVE price of $150.\n* 90 days at 1,124.2 stkAAVE at $150 per token is $15.18M or around 5.11% of the Ecosystem Reserve.\n* The Net spend is $122K per day after taking into consideration the daily Reserve Revenue and daily liquidity mining expenses. This does not take into consideration the 550 AAVE/day Safety Module incentives\n* Daily Reserve Revenue has reduced significantly during January and the chart below shows the image of the recent market conditions. Not the economics above only takes into consideration Aave V1 and V2 market revenue.\n\nFurther details on the daily Reserve Revenue and Economic Reserve valuation can be found on the [Aave Treasury Dashboard](https://dune.xyz/llama/Aave-Treasury-Finances-by-Llama?Trailing%20Num%20Time-Series=180) created by the Llama Community.

The BAL tokens are to be held in the Reserve Factor until further details relating to Aura emerges and then the Aave community can determine if to deploy BAL to receive veBAL or auraBAL, [1].\n\n# Abstract\n\nDeploy a Bonding Curve to acquire an additional 100,000 BAL tokens on market at the chainlink oracle price +50 bps, for a cost $1,708,500 assuming a BAL price of $17. This is an additional purchase to the 200,000 BAL token swap being considered.\n\nAave will become one of eight token holders with 300,000 BAL tokens. All 100,000 BAL tokens are to be retained in the Reserve Factor until such time as further information on auraBAL emerges.\n\n# Motivation\n\nThe original motivation for performing a token swap with Balancer can be found on the ARC - Strategic Investment BAL Token, [2].\n\nWith the additional 100,000 BAL acquisition, Aave would transition from just outside the Top 50 BAL holder to inside the Top 30 holders, [3]. If an additional 75,000 BAL was acquired, totalling 375,000 BAL, then Aave would become a Top 20 holder and this includes three community wallets, one Polygon bridge pool and the main BAL liquidity pool. So really it would be more like the Top 15 holders if another 75,000 BAL was acquired.\n\nWith 300,000 BAL tokens, Aave would have the largest BAL holding of any strategic partner Balancer has partnered with. The largest strategic partnership holding to date is the 270,000 BAL position held by Tribe DAO, [4,5]. Having a larger BAL holding relative to Tribe DAO may become a competitive advantage as Tribe DAO seeks to direct TVL to Rari Fuse pools with the use of the new ERC-4626 vault, [6].\n\nWith the emergence of ERC-4626, a new type of vault, whereby Liquidity Providers (LP) can deposit their stakes BPT tokens into lending pools and earn BAL rewards whilst using staked BPT as collateral, [7]. This is particularly appealing for staked BPT holdings which have minimal Impermanent loss risk. An example would be to use the staked BPT token for the stable coin Balancer Boosted Pool which uses Aave V2 to generate yield and receives BAL rewards, [8]. Based upon the success of wstETH being listed on Aave V2, this may lead to significant Total Value Locked (TVL) growth for Aave which makes up more than 13% of Aave’s mainnet V2 market TVL, [9].\n\nHaving not yet entered in the Curve / Convex tokenomics play, Aave has an opportunity to be an early leader in the veBAL wars. With the emergence of Aura, the Aave community has a choice to determine if the 100,000 BAL to be acquired are to be deployed for veBAL or auraBAL. If Aura is like Convex, then being early and building an Aura holding is worth considering. The first step in both strategies is to acquire a sizable BAL position and as the initial 200,000 BAL is proposed to be deposited into the veBAL contract and locked for 1 year, the 100,000 BAL detailed within this proposal can be deployed into either veBAL or auraBAL contracts.\n\nThere are likely to be many more Balancer Boosted Pools that utilise aTokens in the future and the veBAL votes can be used to help bootstrap these pools by directing BAL rewards to those pools. Using either veBAL or auraBAL to vote for BAL rewards towards pools that create TVL for Aave is a strategic advantage. If Aura evolves like Convex did, then the voter locked AURA token will have more voting influence over BAL rewards than one veBAL token. Being prepared and ready for the Aura token launch is going to position Aave to maximise the upside from its investments as rewards often favour early movers.\n\n# Implementation\n\nA Bonding Curve deployment utilising Chainlink’s BAL/USD oracle feed with a 50 bps incentive for arbitrage trades to acquire BAL on market and deposit into the contract. Aave will provide USDC to fund the Bonding Curve contract. An example of this type of transaction occurred when Tribe purchased $10M of DPI on market, [10].\n\nThe 50 bps fee is to provide an economic incentive for arbitrage traders to attain BAL on market and deposit BAL into the contract profitably by more than offsetting gas costs. This mechanism enables everyone within defi to participate and essentially crowdsources the BAL tokens on Aave’s behalf. Once the BAL has been received it will be transferred to the Reserve Factor.\n\n# References\n\n[1] https://forum.balancer.fi/t/proposal-allowlist-aura-finance-in-balancer-votingescrow/2708\n[2] https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-strategic-partnership-with-balancer/7617/15\n[3] https://etherscan.io/token/0xba100000625a3754423978a60c9317c58a424e3d#balances\n[4] https://forum.balancer.fi/t/proposal-allow-tribe-dao-to-lock-vebal/2888\n[5] https://snapshot.org/#/balancer.eth/proposal/0x7972e1700ac30495ad936038b66055b1e6420c3de5ed1fec963abe5faa2d16a3\n[6] https://tribe.fei.money/t/fip-90-fuse-boosted-usd-balancer-pool-bb-f-usd/4023\n[7] https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4626\n[8] https://app.balancer.fi/#/pool/0x7b50775383d3d6f0215a8f290f2c9e2eebbeceb20000000000000000000000fe\n[9] https://app.aave.com/reserve-overview/?underlyingAsset=0xae7ab96520de3a18e5e111b5eaab095312d7fe84&marketName=proto_mainnet\n[10] https://etherscan.io/address/0x464c71f6c2f760dda6093dcb91c24c39e5d6e18c\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

This is done through the stETH token. stETH tokens represent a tokenized staking deposit and can be held, traded, or sold.\n\nFull ARC and discussion can be viewed here: https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-add-support-for-steth-lido/5793\n\nProposed voting choices:\n1. Yes: Add stETH as proposed (no borrowing)\n2. No: Do not add stETH\n\n## Abstract\n\nThere is strong interest in using stETH to earn additional yield without taking a lot of risk. This is evident through the growth of the stETH/ETH pool on Curve Finance, which has become the most liquid pool on Curve with a liquidity of $3.8 billion.\n\nThe addition of stETH on to Aave can work to attract a larger audience to both Aave and Lido. More ETH staked with Lido would subsequently benefit the decentralization and security of the Ethereum network, to the benefit of the community as a whole. stETH would likely bring new borrow demand to Aave as market participants look to borrow against their staked ETH or lend their stETH for a yield.\n\nWe want people who want to be responsibly long ETH (i.e. via taking leverage on AAVE) to be able to put some extra staking rewards on top.\n\n## Motivation\n\nstETH as DeFi collateral is beneficial for a number of reasons:\n\n- stETH is almost as safe as ETH, price-wise: barring catastrophic scenarios, its value tends to hold the ETH peg well;\n- stETH is a productive asset. Earning rewards on collateral effectively lowers the cost of borrowing. This could make borrowing more attractive on Aave and help to increase market utilization (and therefore Aave’s protocol revenue from stablecoin reserve factors).\n- stETH is a very liquid asset with over $3.8 billion in liquidity locked in the Curve stETH/ETH pool.\n\n## Proposed Risk Parameters\nThese have been modified since the last proposal. The reasons are described below. Generally, the functions of stETH have held consistent during growth and market volatility.\n\nLTV: 70%\nLiquidation Threshold: 75%\nLiquidation Bonus: 7.5%\nReserve Factor: 10%\n\nA LTV of 70% is higher than the 56% average LTV across non-stablecoin assets and 10% lower than ETH’s 80% LTV. This gives the protocol more room to safely liquidate stETH with a volatility profile similar to ETH.\n\nInterest Rate Model (we plan to not have stETH borrowing available initially):\n\nUOptimal: 60%\nBase: 0%\nSlope 1: 8%\nSlope 2: 200%\n\nAs stETH is more suited as collateral instead of a borrowing asset we adjusted the utilization rate to 60% and doubled slope 2 in order to safe guard enough liquidity in the event of market consolidation and liquidation events.\n\nstETH liquidity and risk considerations\n\n- stETH inherits all of ETH’s market risk, so they should be considered together for the purpose of evaluating market risk\n- stETH value is defined and backed by the value of Ether and expectations on the beacon chain withdrawals timeline. As the expected merge gets closer, stETH risk will drop down significantly.\n- stETH is one of the most liquid tokens in crypto with low exchange volumes and extremely high liquidity\n- stETH liquidity is ensured by Lido’s strategy incentivizing a consistent stETH peg\n\n## References\n- [Website](https://lido.fi/)\n- [GitHub](https://github.com/lidofinance)\n- [Whitepaper](https://github.com/lidofinance/lido-dao/blob/master/README.md)\n- [stETH Contract](https://etherscan.io/token/0xae7ab96520de3a18e5e111b5eaab095312d7fe84)\n- [wstETH Contract](https://etherscan.io/token/0x7f39c581f595b53c5cb19bd0b3f8da6c935e2ca0)\n- [Blog](https://blog.lido.fi/)\n- [Primer](https://lido.fi/static/Lido:Ethereum-Liquid-Staking.pdf)\n- [Audits](https://github.com/lidofinance/audits)\n- [Lido Forum](https://research.lido.fi/)\n- [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/vgdPfhZ)\n- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/LidoFinance)\n\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n",

The BAL tokens are to be complemented with ETH and deposited into the 80/20 BAL/ETH pool. The BPT token is deposited into the veBAL contract and locked for 1 year. The veBAL holding is then used to direct incentives to new aToken Boosted Pools, [1].\n\n# Abstract\n\nPerform a token swap with Balancer by exchanging AAVE from the Ecosystem Reserve for 200,000 BAL tokens. The exchange rate to be used is the 90-day moving average price when the votes pass on both sides. \n\nAll 200,000 BAL tokens plus the aBAL tokens in the Reserve Factor (redeemed for BAL) are to be paired with sufficient ETH and deposited into the Balancer V2 BAL:ETH (80:20) pool. The veBAL holding will then participate in Balancer's revised tokenomics that commenced on the 28th March. \n\nInitially, the veBAL will be used to vote BAL rewards to pools which support aTokens that create TVL for Aave and/or AAVE liquidity pools.\n\n# Motivation\n\nAave and Balance have a long history of working together. The AAVE : ETH (80/20) Balancer V1 pool BPT is accepted within the Aave Safe Module and the newly created Balancer Boosted Pools drive TVL to Aave markets, [2].\n\nWhen the AAVE : ETH (80/20) Balancer V1 pool is moved to Balancer V2 and integrated into Aave’s Safety Module, the veBAL tokens can be used to vote BAL rewards to the newly created AAVE : ETH (80/20) Balancer V2 pool.\n\nIn addition, the veBAL can be used to vote BAL rewards to Balancer Boosted Pools which utilise Aave markets in the background to create yield for passively held liquidity, [3]. There are likely to be many more Balancer Boosted Pools that utilise aTokens in the future and the veBAL votes can be used to help bootstrap these pools by directing BAL rewards to those pools. Using veBAL to vote for BAL rewards to pools that strengthen Aave is a strategic advantage of deploying the BAL tokens into the BAL:ETH pool.\n\nBy exchanging AAVE for BAL, the tokenswap reflects the ongoing collaboration and shared vision through governance in each other’s community. The token exchange, plus additional acquisition, is significant enough for Aave to become just outside of the Top 50 BAL tokens holder, based on etherscan BAL holder rankings, [4]. Balancer will become a Top 80 AAVE holder, [5]. Each community will have influence in the other’s governance process, enabling them to best represent their interests and to collaborate.\n\nAave will likely be one of the first movers in the upcoming BAL wars and will gain a strategic advantage to bootstrap new Balancer Boosted Pools which lead to tokens being deposited in Aave markets to earn yield. This has the benefit of creating TVL and Revenue for Aave.\n\nThe initial sizing to acquire 200,000 BAL was something that was reached via discussions with the Balancer community and happens to be the same size as the recent Tribe DAO and Balancer token swap, [6].\n\nThe initial sizing was also determined by the ability to influence how the BAL emissions are to be distributed. If all BPT from the BAL : ETH pool are converted to veBAL, Aave will receive 3.3% of the 14,500 BAL emission schedule which is equivalent to 478 BAL weekly, or $8,126/week at $17/BAL or $422,552/year. If 100% of the current BPT were deposited into the veBAL contract, the yield is very close to 10%. Other deployments from the Reserve Factor will also earn BAL rewards over time, [7].\n\nWith 3.3% of veBAL supply, Aave will determine where 2,680 of the 81,200 BAL tokens are to be distributed each week via the Ethereum mainnet pool gauge. This is equivalent to 5% APR on a $47.40M pool without any compounding or other yield sources like swap fees or yield from Aave markets. This is sufficient to support bootstrapping new liquidity pools that support growing TVL for the Aave community. Given the size of the Aave community investment in the Balancer community, it is reasonable to think that Liquidity Mining Committee may also be voting to allocate a portion of there 14,500 weekly BAL emission to support Balancer Boosted Pools which drive TVL to Aave markets.\n\n# Implementation\n\nThe token swap is to be performed by both Balancer and Aave by depositing tokens into a contract like how Tribe DAO swapped TRIBE for INDEX, [8].\n\nThe aBAL holding in the Reserve Factor, 1,890 aBAL at the time of writing which will be redeemed for BAL and deployed along with the 200,000 BAL tokens attained via the proposed swap, [9].\n\nOnce the BAL has been received it will be transferred to the Reserve Factor from there the BAL and matching amount of ETH will be deployed into the BAL : ETH pool on Balancer V2. The BPT token is deposited into the veBAL contract and locked for 1 year.\n\nThe veBAL holding is then used to direct incentives to new aToken Boosted Pools\n\n# References:\n\n[1] https://forum.balancer.fi/t/introducing-vebal-tokenomics/2512\n[2] https://pools.balancer.exchange/#/pool/0xc697051d1c6296c24ae3bcef39aca743861d9a81/\n[3] https://app.balancer.fi/#/pool/0x7b50775383d3d6f0215a8f290f2c9e2eebbeceb20000000000000000000000fe\n[4] https://etherscan.io/token/0xba100000625a3754423978a60c9317c58a424e3d#balances\n[5] https://etherscan.io/token/0x7fc66500c84a76ad7e9c93437bfc5ac33e2ddae9#balances\n[6] https://tribe.fei.money/t/fip-33-swap-between-balancer-dao-and-fei-dao/3555\n[7] https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-consolidate-aave-v1-v2-amm-reserve-factors-purchase-cvx-and-deploy-to-earn-yield/6797\n[8] [https://github.com/fei-protocol/fei-protocol-core/blob/develop/contracts/utils/OtcEscrow.sol](https://eur03.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Ffei-protocol%2Ffei-protocol-core%2Fblob%2Fdevelop%2Fcontracts%2Futils%2FOtcEscrow.sol&data=04%7C01%7Cmatthew.graham2%40technipfmc.com%7Cfcf199dfb3f64bb3b4ca08da0b1a125b%7C0804c95193a0405d80e4fa87c7551d6a%7C0%7C0%7C637834504350429866%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C2000&sdata=wnFuy5LgP7IJ2G7A4%2B1x%2FBMp1k1bbqw9%2Bk6jkuimd0E%3D&reserved=0)\n[9] https://etherscan.io/address/0x464c71f6c2f760dda6093dcb91c24c39e5d6e18c\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",
