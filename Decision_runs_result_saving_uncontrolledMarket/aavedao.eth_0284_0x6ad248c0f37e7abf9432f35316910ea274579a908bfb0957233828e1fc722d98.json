It allows the DAO to restart GHO minting while keeping the peg in check.\n\nGHO is expected to provide 10% of all DAO overall revenue by next week.\n\nHowever, we have to witness less collaborative behavior from some ecosystem actors. In light of this, it seems suboptimal for the Aave DAO to reward uncollaborative protocols & behaviors.\n\nThis is why we suggest stopping any subsidies to the makerDAO ecosystem; the Aave DAO has already paid millions via the AAVE and third-party LM programs and has been repaid by creating competitive forks and activating D3M in a protocol that has stolen millions of revenue from this DAO with no safety track record using a market sensible collateral.\n\nWith this proposal, a single $ in Morpho Blue or Spark will nullify any Merit Airdrop for the user.\nsDAI is considered a makerDAO product, not a Spark product; holding simply sDAI or having it in Aave will not dilute a user.\n\nThis proposal aims to be enabled for Merit Round 2 and all subsequent rounds.\n\n## Specification\n\n### Proposed Changes:\n\n### Conservative Option\n\n1. Remove \"MakerDAO fren\" Boosters. for the usage of sDAI as collateral\n\n### Aggresive Option\n\n1. Remove \"MakerDAO fren\" Boosters. for the usage of sDAI as collateral\n2. Include Morpho Blue & Spark users in the \"User of Non-Aligned Protocol\" diluter.\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. If this proposal reaches a consensus on Snapshot, update the Merit reward system accordingly\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThis proposal is made independently by the ACI.\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

        "body": "---\n### [ARFC]  Risk Parameters for DAI Update\n\n### Author:  ACI (Aave Chan Initiative)\n\n### Date: 2024-04-02\n\n---\n\n### **Summary**\n\nThis proposal aims to update the risk parameters for the DAI stablecoin across all Aave deployments.\n\n## Motivation\n\nMakerDAO's recent aggressive actions with their D3M program have resulted in a significant increase in the \"D3M\" credit line for DAI, growing from 0 to predicted 600 million DAI within less than a month. With the potential extension of this credit line to 1 billion DAI in the near term, the unpredictability of future governance decisions by MakerDAO raises concerns regarding the inherent risk nature of DAI as collateral.\n\nThese liquidity injections are done in a non-battle-tested protocol with a \"hands off\" risk management ethos and no safety module risk mitigation feature.\n\nThe Aave protocol had previous experience of the consequences of reckless minting policies at a much smaller scale, with Angle's AgEUR (now EURA) mint into EULER a week before their hack and jEUR minting into Midas leading to the asset long-term depeg.\n\nGiven that only a fraction of DAI deposits are currently utilized as collateral on Aave, and users have ample liquidity to switch to USDC or USDT as alternative collateral options, this proposal aims to mitigate potential risks without significantly negatively impacting our user base.\n\n## Specification\n\n### Proposed Changes:\n\n### **Conservative**\n\n**Decrease DAI and sDAI LTV by 12 Percentage Points, LT 1 Percentage Point Per 100M Deployed:**\n\nBased on the details outlined in this [post](https://governance.aave.com/t/generalized-lt-ltv-reduction-on-aave/16766), there is a planned gradual reduction in the LTV ratios for DAI and sDAI on Aave V3, transitioning from 77% to 75%, accompanied by a decrease in the LT from 80% to 78% across most chains. Considering these anticipated adjustments and the maximum implied percentage of total DAI backing by (s)USDe at 12%, we conservatively recommend a linear reduction of an additional 12 percentage points in LTV. Regarding the LT, we suggest a conditional decrease of 1 percentage point for every 100M in D3M exposure, with a maximum reduction of 6 percentage points, assuming the full 600M is deployed. LT reductions naturally come with potentially induced liquidations, thus if the amount liquidated due to LT changes is deemed too large, we will modify accordingly. This process will begin with a 1% reduction from the current value to account for the initial 100M, once the initial expected decrease has been completed.\n\n**Given current inconsistencies in DAI LTs across the different chains, we will aim to align the LTs and LTVs in the first stage of this proposal. This means that in instances where the LT is currently set higher, the initial reduction would be more than the 1% suggested above. This standardization will be carefully planned to minimize the impact of LT reductions on the likelihood of liquidations.**\n\n### Specification\n\n| Chain | Asset | Current Expected LTV | Recommended LTV | Current Expected LT | Recommended LT (1st stage) | Recommended LT (Last Stage) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| V3 Ethereum | DAI | 75% | 63% | 78% | 77% | 72% |\n| V3 Arbitrum | DAI | 75% | 63% | 78% | 77% | 72% |\n| V3 Optimism | DAI | 75% | 63% | 80% | 77% | 72% |\n| V3 Polygon | DAI | 75% | 63% | 78% | 77% | 72% |\n| V3 Gnosis | WXDAI | 75% | 63% | 78% | 77% | 72% |\n| V3 Avalanche | DAI.e | 75% | 63% | 80% | 77% | 72% |\n| V3 Metis | m.DAI | 75% | 63% | 80% | 77% | 72% |\n| V3 Ethereum | sDAI | 75% | 63% | 78% | 77% | 72% |\n| V2 Ethereum | DAI | 75% | 63% | 87% | 77% | 72% |\n| V2 Polygon | DAI | 75% | 63% | 80% | 77% | 72% |\n| V2 Avalanche | DAI | 75% | 63% | 80% | 77% | 72% |\n\n### Aggressive\n\n**Decrease DAI and sDAI LTV to 0%, LT 1 Percentage Point Per 50M Deployed:**\n\nGiven Maker's allocation of a significant portion of potential DAI backing to a new, riskier asset, should the community wish to take more aggressive action, we propose a temporary reduction in the LTV to 0%. Regarding the LT, our recommendation is to conditionally decrease by 1 percentage point for every 50M in D3M exposure, with a maximum reduction of 12 percentage points, assuming the full 600M is deployed. LT reductions naturally come with potentially induced liquidations, thus if the amount liquidated due to LT changes is deemed too large, we will modify accordingly. This proposal prioritizes a risk-averse strategy to hedge against potential future actions by MakerDAO, considering the minimal revenues generated from collateral usage. This process will begin with a 2% reduction from the current value to account for the initial 100M.\n\n**Given current inconsistencies in DAI LTs across the different chains, we will aim to align the LTs and LTVs in the first stage of this proposal. This means that in instances where the LT is currently set higher, the initial reduction would be more than the 2% suggested above. This standardization will be carefully planned to minimize the impact of LT reductions on the likelihood of liquidations.**\n\n### Specification\n\n| Chain | Asset | Current Expected LTV | Recommended LTV | Current Expected LT | Recommended LT (1st stage) | Recommended LT (Last Stage) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| V3 Ethereum | DAI | 75% | 0% | 78% | 76% | 66% |\n| V3 Arbitrum | DAI | 75% | 0% | 78% | 76% | 66% |\n| V3 Optimism | DAI | 75% | 0% | 80% | 76% | 66% |\n| V3 Polygon | DAI | 75% | 0% | 78% | 76% | 66% |\n| V3 Gnosis | WXDAI | 75% | 0% | 78% | 76% | 66% |\n| V3 Avalanche | DAI.e | 75% | 0% | 80% | 76% | 66% |\n| V3 Metis | m.DAI | 75% | 0% | 80% | 76% | 66% |\n| V3 Ethereum | sDAI | 75% | 0% | 78% | 76% | 66% |\n| V3 Gnosis | sDAI | 75% | 0% | 78% | 76% | 66% |\n| V2 Ethereum | DAI | 75% | 0% | 87% | 76% | 66% |\n| V2 Polygon | DAI | 75% | 0% | 80% | 76% | 66% |\n| V2 Avalanche | DAI | 75% | 0% | 80% | 76% | 66% |\n\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. Gather community feedback and consensus on the proposed changes.\n2. Proceed to ARFC snapshot stage for formal community sentiment check.\n3. If successful, escalate to the AIP (Aave Improvement Proposal) stage for implementation.\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThis proposal is made independently by the ACI.\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)",

        "body": "---\n\nTitle: [TEMP CHECK] Aave V3 MVP deployment on Neon EVM Mainnet\n\nAuthor: Neon Foundation & Aave Chan Initiative (ACI)\n\nCreated: 2024-01-15\n\n---\n\n# Simple Summary:\n\nThis TEMP CHECK proposes the deployment of Aave V3 MVP on the NEON EVM Mainnet, expanding Aave’s presence and enabling access to unaddressed users, liquidity, community and ecosystem of Solana.\n\n# Background:\n\nNeon EVM is a fully compatible Ethereum environment solution built on the Solana blockchain which makes it the first parallelized EVM with direct access to Solana liquidity. Neon EVM allows developers to deploy Ethereum dApps on Solana and access its native ecosystem and network benefits: low fees, high transaction speeds, and parallel transaction execution capabilities without changing their codebases. Neon EVM currently has interoperability with Solana SPL tokens and the plan is to develop full interoperability with Solana smart contracts as well in 2024.\n\nSolana is a thriving blockchain with a strong DeFi ecosystem and a large user base. Solana ecosystem took a hit due to market conditions and FTX situation last year as TVL fell from all-time high of +$9b to +$250m in July 2023 but since then it has shown strong growth and it’s the fastest growing ecosystem across major blockchain networks. Current TVL is over $1.5b making it the fifth-largest chain by TVL.\n\n# Motivation\n\nAave has emerged as a prominent player in DeFi lending across various EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) networks, including Ethereum, alt L1s, and L2s. Neon EVM wants to further support the mission of a multi-chain Aave and proposes deploying Aave v3 on the Neon EVM Mainnet to expand lending to the Solana ecosystem. Aave’s expansion to the largest non-EVM ecosystem will further reinforce its place as the top liquidity market on-chain and open up possibilities for growth and collaboration between the Aave, Solana, and Neon EVM communities.\n\nAave V3 deployment on Neon EVM will enable Aave to access the deep liquidity on Solana and enables Solana ecosystem users to get access to the premier lending protocol through Neon EVM. The platform will allow Aave to deploy on Solana without any reconfiguration of the Aave v3 codebase and hence without incurring major development efforts and costs to the Aave DAO. Also, a third-party team has already deployed Aave V3 fork on Neon EVM Devnet which implies the full compatibility of Aave V3 codebase with Neon EVM.\n\nThese benefits of Neon EVM combined with Aave’s impressive push for a cross-chain future, provide an exciting opportunity to capture the market share of Solana’s DeFi ecosystem and grow the user base and community of the protocol, increase TVL, and protocol revenue. At the same time, Neon EVM would benefit from having a trusted, flagship DeFi project like Aave on its platform, further diversifying and growing the DeFi options available to its users and wider Solana ecosystem.\n\nThe deployment of Aave v3 on the Neon EVM would enable Aave to tap into the Solana DeFi market and make a unique and significant contribution to the decentralized finance movement. This deployment is expected to substantially reduce costs and better scalability in comparison to EVM networks, while also providing users with access to Solana’s liquidity and the overall ecosystem. As Solana gains momentum as a prominent blockchain platform, the integration of Aave’s advanced lending and borrowing protocol could further catalyze the DeFi ecosystem on Solana and Neon EVM.\n\nThere have been significant concerns around the Downtime of Solana blockchain in the past but continuous innovation is happening within the ecosystem and new tools are rolling out on a continuous basis to make the network more resilient, efficient and scalable. For e.g. Firedancer 2 by Jump Crypto.\n\nFurthermore, the idea of Aave v3 deployment on Neon EVM was also recently mentioned by Stani and contributing teams like Aave Chan Initiative (ACI). Tweet by Stani 26, Tweet by Marc Zeller 25\n\nAdditionally, Neon EVM also recently announced the launch of Neon Points Program 10 to attract users and builders to accelerate the adoption of the network. We will include Aave in our points program to incentivize user activity on Aave v3 on Neon EVM with boosted points.\n\n# Specification\n\nThis proposal suggests deploying Aave V3 on Neon EVM Mainnet with limited deployment of initial assets and conservative risk parameters.This approach will enable Aave to strategically establish a presence in the Solana ecosystem while minimizing risk exposure.\n\nThe proposal suggests three collaterals (SOL, mSOL, jitoSOL 1) and one borrowable asset (USDC) with no isolated mode, e-mode enabled for correlated assets (SOL, mSOL, jitoSOL), conservative LTV and supply, borrow caps. If this proposal is to pass, we will conduct a comprehensive technical risk assessment for the suggested assets at the ARFC phase to determine their risk parameters. We also invite risk service providers and community members to provide their analysis.\n\n# Infraestructure\n\n- Documentation: [Neon EVM Docs](https://docs.neonevm.org/docs/quick_start)\n\n- Compatibility with Ethereum RPC endpoints: Neon EVM supports almost all standards. Here is the link to supported JSON-RPC - [Neon EVM Docs](https://docs.neonevm.org/docs/evm_compatibility/json_rpc_api_methods)\n\n- Indexers: theGraph\n\n- Oracles: Chainlink, Pyth\n\n- Wallets: Metamask, Ledger and support other EVM network wallets.\n\n- Block explorers: [NeonScan](https://neonscan.org/),  [Blockscout](https://neon.blockscout.com/)\n\n- Address formatting: It is the same as the standard Ethereum address.\n\n- On-chain multi-signature infrastructure: Friendly fork of Gnosis Safe.\n\n- Cross-chain Interactions: [deBridge](https://debridge.finance/) ([announcement](https://twitter.com/deBridgeFinance/status/1737812739320599032), expected to go live on Mainnet in January)\n\n- NeonPass: NeonPass links Solana and Neon EVM to provide a smoother EVM-compatibility experience for end users (https://neonpass.live/). NeonPass is the revolving door of liquidity between Solana and Neon EVM. NeonPass is not a bridge connecting two separate blockchain ecosystems. Rather, it acts as a two-way transfer tool for bringing assets in and out of the Neon EVM platform, which itself is a Solana smart contract directly connected to the network.\n\n# Disclaimer:\n\nThis proposal is powered by Skywards. The Aave Chan Initiative is not directly affiliated with Neon Foundation and did not receive compensation for creation this proposal.\n\nThe co-author is a team member of Neon Foundation and holds SOL, NEON tokens.\n\n# Next Steps:\n\n1. Temperature Check: Gather community feedback and assess sentiment towards the proposal of deploying Aave V3 on Neon EVM and proceed with Snapshot if positive.\n\n2. ARFC: If the Temperature Check Snapshot indicates positive sentiment, proceed to the ARFC stage for further discussion, risk parameter evaluation network analysis and finalization of the proposal.\n\n3. AIP: If the ARFC stage Snapshot is successful, submit the proposal as an AIP for voting and on-chain governance approval.\n\n# Copyright:\nCopyright and related rights waived under CC0.",

        "body": "---\nTitle: [TEMP CHECK] Further Aave v1 deprecation strategy\n\nAuthor: BGD Labs @bgdlabs\n\nDate: 2024-01-09\n\n---\n\n## Summary\nApprove further steps of Aave v1 off-boarding, to reduce operational overhead on deprecated Aave instances.\n\n\n## Motivation\nThe Aave protocol v1 was released in January 2020 and eventually superseded by Aave protocol v2 in December on the same year.\n\nWhile Aave v1 has been deprecated for a long time, some liquidity is still stuck on the protocol 1. Even if this instance is not covered by the Aave Safety Module, being part of Aave, it still is monitored and evaluated whenever development and/or security decisions are made.\n\nThis creates meaningful overhead for all involved development & security teams, which directly adds cost to the Aave DAO. Additionally, the architecture of Aave v1 is quite different to Aave v2 & v3, making it the most ad-hoc instance of Aave.\n\nFor the previous reasons, we think the community should evaluate approving extra off-boarding steps.\n\n\n## Specification\nTo achieve a complete off-boarding of Aave v1, the following needs to be completed:\n\n- All debt has to be settled, in order to allow liquidity providers on v1 to withdraw.\n- All assets have to be withdrawn.\n\nTo minimise the impact on users we propose a phased approach, where each phase could last in the order of 1-3 weeks.\n\n### Phase 1\nIn a first phase we recommend to upgrade the liquidation mechanism on the protocol in the following ways:\n\n- It should no longer be possible to receive aTokens for liquidations (as the goal is to remove liquidity, not transfer it from user to user).\n- It should be possible to liquidate healthy (collateralised) positions with a fixed liquidationBonus (e.g. 1%). This value should be small to not hurt borrowers, while still being big enough to incentivise liquidations. If this Temp Check is successful, we will confirm the number with risk providers., but 1% at the current moment would make the liquidation profitable for approximately 85% of the positions to liquidate.\n- It should be possible to liquidate a entire position at once (currently on Aave v1 only 50% of a position can be liquidated).\n- Interest rates should be lowered to the minimum, as the previously described always-enabled dynamics remove any need of utilisation dynamics.\n- Remove flash loan fee, as there should not be extra incentives for liquidity providers.\n\n### Phase 2\nIn a second phase we recommend increasing the fixed liquidationBonus to a higher percentage.\n\nThe exact number must be chosen based on current market conditions to minimise user impact, but allow economical liquidations.\n\n### Phase 3\nOnce the big majority of debt is repaid, we recommend to introduce a forced withdrawal mechanism. With forced withdrawals anybody could withdraw on behalf of any liquidity provider on Aave v1, with the funds received by the holder of the aToken.\n\nIt is important to clarify that further technical aspects on this should be analysed before executing this step, for example smart contracts receiving funds without triggering a withdrawal.\n\n---\n\nAfter all the Phases are finished, additional ad-hoc steps can be executed, like Rescue Mission for locked funds.\n\n\n## Next Steps\n\nIf this TEMP CHECK is approved, we will proceed with an ARFC, with the final steps including feedback from risk service providers, and precise technical decisions.\n\nFinally, AIPs will be created for the different phases.\n\n\n## Copyright\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0 .",

        "body": "---\n\n### Title: [ARFC] Expansion of \"Orbit\" - A DAO Funded Delegate Platform Initiative\n### Author: Marc Zeller @marczeller - Aave Chan Initiative\n### Date: 2023-09-07\n\n---\n\n## Summary:\n\nThis ARFC proposes the expansion of the [\"Orbit\" delegate platform initiative](https://governance.aave.com/t/introducing-orbit-a-delegate-platform-funding-initiative-by-aci/13241), transitioning it from being funded by the Aave-Chan Initiative (ACI) to being funded by the Aave DAO. The goal is to enhance the sustainability and independence of the program, ensuring continued support for active delegates in the Aave community.\n\n## Motivation:\n\nThe pilot phase of Orbit, funded by ACI, has been a success in its first quarter. Recognizing its positive impact, there's a need to expand and generalize the program, ensuring its longevity and alignment with the broader Aave community goals.\n\n## Specification:\n\nThe proposed funding for the Orbit initiative remains at $5,000 per month, with payments to be made in GHO stablecoin. Orbit operates on a quarterly basis, with eligibility criteria defined for each quarter.\n\nFor the upcoming quarter, the eligibility criteria will mirror that of the [[ARFC] Quarterly Gas Rebate Distribution - August 2023](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-quarterly-gas-rebate-distribution-august-2023/14680). In subsequent quarters, a threshold of voting power and diversity of delegation will be introduced to ensure the program's integrity and to prevent potential abuse. To fund the Orbit initiative, stablecoins from the Aave DAO treasury will be used to purchase GHO on secondary markets, which is expected to have a minor positive effect on the GHO peg.\n\n### Eligible Delegates:\n\n| Delegate Name | Address | Participation Rate |\n|---------------|---------|-------------------|\n| StableLab | 0xea172676e4105e92cc52dbf45fd93b274ec96676 | 100.0% |\n| ACI | 0x329c54289ff5d6b7b7dae13592c6b1eda1543ed4 | 94.67% |\n| Wintermute | 0xb933aee47c438f22de0747d57fc239fe37878dd1 | 93.33% |\n| Keyrock | 0x1855f41b8a86e701e33199de7c25d3e3830698ba | 93.33% |\n| LBS Blockchain | 0xb83b3e9c8e3393889afb272d354a7a3bd1fbcf5c | 86.67% |\n| HKUST | 0xe4594a66d9507ffc0d4335cc240bd61c1173e666 | 78.67% |\n| Michigan | 0x13bdae8c5f0fc40231f0e6a4ad70196f59138548 | 73.33% |\n| NewTokenLogic | 0x2cc1ade245020fc5aae66ad443e1f66e01c54df1 | 32.0%* |\n\n*Note: Tokenlogic transitioned from an old to a new delegate address during last quarter, their cumulative score considering both addresses is matching other delegates scores*\n\n### Recipient Delegates\n\nhere's the list of delegates accepting participation in Orbit. for the next quarter\n\n| Delegate Name | Address | Budget |\n|---------------|---------|-------------------|\n| StableLab | 0xea172676e4105e92cc52dbf45fd93b274ec96676 | 15.000 GHO |\n| Keyrock | 0x1855f41b8a86e701e33199de7c25d3e3830698ba | 15.000 GHO |\n| LBS Blockchain | 0xb83b3e9c8e3393889afb272d354a7a3bd1fbcf5c | 15.000 GHO |\n| HKUST | 0xe4594a66d9507ffc0d4335cc240bd61c1173e666 | 15.000 GHO |\n| Michigan | 0x13bdae8c5f0fc40231f0e6a4ad70196f59138548 | 15.000 GHO |\n|**Total Budget** | **75.000 GHO**|\n\n### Implementation:\n\nIf this ARFC gets governance support, the implementation will consolidate some Aave DAO treasury stablecoin holdings to acquire GHO on secondary markets. Subsequently, a new set of streams of 15,000 GHO will be created to the eligible delegates' addresses for a period of 90 days.\n\n## Disclaimer:\nThe Aave Chan Initiative is not affiliated with or paid by any third parties to publish this ARFC.\n\n## Next Steps:\n\n1. Gather community feedback on this ARFC.\n2. If consensus is reached, escalate this proposal to the ARFC Snapshot stage.\n3. If ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, escalate to AIP stage.\n\n## Copyright:\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

The voting timeline shows strong and stable support for YAE, and forum sentiment is generally positive or neutral with some calls for structured oversight. Similar past proposals aimed at adjusting rates or booster settings, although successful in vote results, were associated with declines in token price and TVL, informing cautious optimism for this extension.
