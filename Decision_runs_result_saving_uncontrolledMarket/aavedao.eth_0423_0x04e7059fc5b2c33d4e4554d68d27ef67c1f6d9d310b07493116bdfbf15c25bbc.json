        "author": "0x329c54289Ff5D6B7b7daE13592C6B1EDA1543eD4",
        "body": "## **Introduction**\n\nThe Aave Chan Initiative (ACI) is a delegate platform dedicated to actively participating in Aave governance and contributing to the protocol's success. As the Aave ecosystem matures, it is essential to have diverse and independent delegate platforms to drive the protocol forward.\n\nTo continue our efforts and effectively serve the Aave community, we are seeking a 6-month budget allocation. This budget will support our ongoing initiatives and enable us to expand our team and resources for maximum impact.\n\n## **ACI's current & future areas of focus**\n\n1. **Governance and AIP Development**\n    - Active participation in Aave governance discussions & votes\n    - Developing and submitting snapshot votes & AIPs\n    - Engaging with the community on forum discussions\n    - Collaborating with other delegates and stakeholders\n2. **Treasury Efficiency and Management**\n    - Collaborate with DAO service contributors, such as Llama, to enhance Aave DAO treasury management.\n    - Support initiatives and actively participate in efforts to improve treasury efficiency, led by Llama and other contributors.\n    - Drive the adoption of strategic investments, diversification, and risk mitigation in treasury allocation.\n    - Establish a cost-conscious culture and ensure responsible spending from the treasury for the benefit of the Aave protocol and its users.\n3. **Protocol and Ecosystem Development**\n    - Support the onboarding of new stablecoins, strategic assets, and LSDs\n    - Explore synergies with other DeFi platforms (e.g., Curve, Balancer, Arrakis)\n    - Promote the use of yield-bearing assets and LP tokens as collateral\n    - Participate in discussions around GHO and Safety Module improvements and advocate for “Real Yield” revenue for the Safety module paid in GHO\n    - Support the expansion of Aave markets in “new Frontiers” networks\n4. **Research and Analysis**\n    - Conduct in-depth research on DeFi trends and developments\n    - Provide insights and recommendations to the Aave community\n    - Analyze the performance and impact of Aave governance decisions\n    - Assess new risk mitigation strategies and techniques\n5. **Team Expansion and Operations**\n    - Grow the ACI team to support the Aave ecosystem better\n    - Cover operational expenses, including tools, subscriptions, and infrastructure\n    - Foster a collaborative environment for continuous learning and improvement\n    - Start a “Meta-Governance” focus for ACI. While the ACI can be considered “Aave-Maximalist,” there’s a lot of potential for having an active presence in other DeFi DAOs and representing Aave-DAO interest there, compared to other “professional” delegates, the laser-focus of ACI on Aave DAO interest will allow to have a voice focused on Aave synergies with other actors of the ecosystem.\n6. **Independence & Transparency**\n    - While the ACI grew to become the largest Aave DAO delegate platform, we are proud that our voting power originates from hundreds of individuals from the community that decided to trust the ACI with their voting and proposal power.\n   - To the best of our knowledge, the ACI voting & proposal power is not linked to any specific entity, Investment firm, or third-party protocol, allowing the ACI to remain 100% independent & focus on the benefit of the Aave protocol.\n   - The ACI firmly declined any form of third-party compensation for creating proposals & publishing AIPs as it would be against our independence ethos. The ACI works for the Aave DAO solely & uniquely.\n   - The ACI created & self-imposed mandatory disclosure on every proposal and will continue to support a transparency culture within the Aave DAO.\n\n## **Previous Work**\n\nHere are some notable achievements and contributions made by the Aave Chan Initiative:\n\n- **Governance Coordination**: The ACI actively supported governance participation & coordination; since the Launch of the ACI, exactly **ZERO** AIPs have failed to meet a 320k AAVE vote participation, while it was unfortunately common in 2022.\n- **AIPs**: The ACI presented and created numerous AIPs that have successfully been implemented to improve the Aave protocol. Since the Launch of the ACI, The AAVE DAO is now the most Active major DeFI DAO in the ecosystem. Q1 2023 was the most active quarter in terms of governance ever for Aave.\n    \n- **Governance improvement**: The ACI is actively involved in improving governance efficiency by providing the community with new frameworks, templates, fast-tracks & shortcuts to make Aave as efficient as possible.\n- **Delegators & contributor coordination:** The ACI actively worked with and supported other DAO delegates, contributors, community members & third-party actors by providing feedback on their proposals, technical support when needed, and doing numerous “co-authorship” synergies with other DAO actors.\n\n## **Requested Budget**\n\nWe are requesting a total budget of $250,000 for 6 months period to support our initiatives, team expansion, and operations. This budget will help us:\n\n- Sustainably continue our current work\n- Cover operational expenses, including tools, subscriptions, and infrastructure required to support our work\n- Grow the ACI team, allowing us to better serve the Aave community and expand our areas of focus. While the “One-Man Army” meme is fun, the current workload and ambitions for the future are not compatible with a single-person operation\n- Establish an active presence in other DeFi DAOs, representing Aave-DAO interests and exploring synergies with other actors in the ecosystem\n\nBy securing this budget, the Aave Chan Initiative will be in a sustainable position to continue to provide value to the Aave ecosystem.\n\n## **Next Steps**\n\nIf the TEMP CHECK is successful and the community supports our proposal, we will move forward with a formal ARFC submission detailing the proposal's specifics such as technical implementation of the proposal.\nWe commit to maintaining transparency throughout the process and regularly updating the community on our progress.\n\nThank you for considering our proposal. We appreciate your support and look forward to working together to drive the success of the Aave protocol.",

        "body": "---\n\n### Title: [ARFC] Expansion of \"Orbit\" - A DAO Funded Delegate Platform Initiative\n### Author: Marc Zeller @marczeller - Aave Chan Initiative\n### Date: 2023-09-07\n\n---\n\n## Summary:\n\nThis ARFC proposes the expansion of the [\"Orbit\" delegate platform initiative](https://governance.aave.com/t/introducing-orbit-a-delegate-platform-funding-initiative-by-aci/13241), transitioning it from being funded by the Aave-Chan Initiative (ACI) to being funded by the Aave DAO. The goal is to enhance the sustainability and independence of the program, ensuring continued support for active delegates in the Aave community.\n\n## Motivation:\n\nThe pilot phase of Orbit, funded by ACI, has been a success in its first quarter. Recognizing its positive impact, there's a need to expand and generalize the program, ensuring its longevity and alignment with the broader Aave community goals.\n\n## Specification:\n\nThe proposed funding for the Orbit initiative remains at $5,000 per month, with payments to be made in GHO stablecoin. Orbit operates on a quarterly basis, with eligibility criteria defined for each quarter.\n\nFor the upcoming quarter, the eligibility criteria will mirror that of the [[ARFC] Quarterly Gas Rebate Distribution - August 2023](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-quarterly-gas-rebate-distribution-august-2023/14680). In subsequent quarters, a threshold of voting power and diversity of delegation will be introduced to ensure the program's integrity and to prevent potential abuse. To fund the Orbit initiative, stablecoins from the Aave DAO treasury will be used to purchase GHO on secondary markets, which is expected to have a minor positive effect on the GHO peg.\n\n### Eligible Delegates:\n\n| Delegate Name | Address | Participation Rate |\n|---------------|---------|-------------------|\n| StableLab | 0xea172676e4105e92cc52dbf45fd93b274ec96676 | 100.0% |\n| ACI | 0x329c54289ff5d6b7b7dae13592c6b1eda1543ed4 | 94.67% |\n| Wintermute | 0xb933aee47c438f22de0747d57fc239fe37878dd1 | 93.33% |\n| Keyrock | 0x1855f41b8a86e701e33199de7c25d3e3830698ba | 93.33% |\n| LBS Blockchain | 0xb83b3e9c8e3393889afb272d354a7a3bd1fbcf5c | 86.67% |\n| HKUST | 0xe4594a66d9507ffc0d4335cc240bd61c1173e666 | 78.67% |\n| Michigan | 0x13bdae8c5f0fc40231f0e6a4ad70196f59138548 | 73.33% |\n| NewTokenLogic | 0x2cc1ade245020fc5aae66ad443e1f66e01c54df1 | 32.0%* |\n\n*Note: Tokenlogic transitioned from an old to a new delegate address during last quarter, their cumulative score considering both addresses is matching other delegates scores*\n\n### Recipient Delegates\n\nhere's the list of delegates accepting participation in Orbit. for the next quarter\n\n| Delegate Name | Address | Budget |\n|---------------|---------|-------------------|\n| StableLab | 0xea172676e4105e92cc52dbf45fd93b274ec96676 | 15.000 GHO |\n| Keyrock | 0x1855f41b8a86e701e33199de7c25d3e3830698ba | 15.000 GHO |\n| LBS Blockchain | 0xb83b3e9c8e3393889afb272d354a7a3bd1fbcf5c | 15.000 GHO |\n| HKUST | 0xe4594a66d9507ffc0d4335cc240bd61c1173e666 | 15.000 GHO |\n| Michigan | 0x13bdae8c5f0fc40231f0e6a4ad70196f59138548 | 15.000 GHO |\n|**Total Budget** | **75.000 GHO**|\n\n### Implementation:\n\nIf this ARFC gets governance support, the implementation will consolidate some Aave DAO treasury stablecoin holdings to acquire GHO on secondary markets. Subsequently, a new set of streams of 15,000 GHO will be created to the eligible delegates' addresses for a period of 90 days.\n\n## Disclaimer:\nThe Aave Chan Initiative is not affiliated with or paid by any third parties to publish this ARFC.\n\n## Next Steps:\n\n1. Gather community feedback on this ARFC.\n2. If consensus is reached, escalate this proposal to the ARFC Snapshot stage.\n3. If ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, escalate to AIP stage.\n\n## Copyright:\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

        "body": "Title: [TEMP CHECK] Aave V3 Deployment on Linea Testnet\n\n@fig – Flipside Crypto & @DAOstrat.C - Consensys / Linea\n\nDate: 06-23-2023\n\nContact:\n\nGovernance@Consensys.net\n\n-----\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nThis Temperature Check seeks the community’s input on the opportunity to deploy Aave V3 on Linea Testnet and move to Mainnet right after all pre-conditions and dependencies are met on Linea Mainnet. Linea seeks to support Aave’s multichain future while establishing Aave as a leading market on a promising zkEVM with a robust distribution network.\n\n## Background\n\n### About Linea\n\nLinea is a scalable L2 on top of Ethereum powered by a zkEVM tech stack incubated by Consensys, resulting from over 20 months of R&D from Consensys's research team. This team has a track record of successful projects in the zk space, including the GNARK library and active involvement in the Merge. Moreover, Linea is well-connected with developers in the broader ecosystem through existing relationships with MetaMask, Infura, and Truffle. The tech stack that powers Linea aims to support a wide ecosystem extending Ethereum Mainnet capabilities. It intends to align its onboarding and distribution with these products to serve developers, protocols, and builders better.\n\nLinea aims to become a Type 2 zkEVM and achieve EVM-equivalence, processing native EVM bytecode for proving and verification. This approach allows for the execution of Solidity smart contracts without needing modifications or re-audit and compatibility at the RPC level with widely adopted middleware and toolsets, providing developers with a familiar environment to build using well-established tools and infrastructure. Linea’s technical value proposition includes the following:\n\n1. ***EVM Equivalence*** - The network avoids transpilers or custom compilers on bytecode, meaning the Ethereum L1 solidity code requires no modification. This significantly reduces deployment costs (no need to re-audit the code) and the risk of bugs and hacks by taking the compiled bytecode directly from Solidity.\n\n2. ***Commitment to Decentralization*** - The Linea team has publicly discussed their intent to decentralize the network within the first 12 months of operation. This includes a state-of-the-art decentralized prover and sequencer structure. Research into these topics is currently underway at Consensys.\n\n3. ***Continual strive for innovation*** - Our priority is pushing the boundaries of the Web3 space while maintaining the highest security and full EVM compatibility. Notably, Linea fully supports EIP-4337 (Account Abstraction), and, in collaboration with key stakeholders, the network already utilizes a single-entry-point contract and hosts top-tier bundlers and paymasters services. Much effort will also be provided to foster human-driven activity by incentivizing projects that leverage attestations and identity ownership.\n\nLinea’s testnet has handled over 2 million transactions under private beta and over 33 million transactions under public beta. Many of these transactions are users of the ongoing Voyage quest, a crucial initiative designed to help stress-test the network. The network has also shown unprecedented developer activity, with over 4.3 M unique addresses that have deployed more than 1.8M contracts, showcasing a vibrant and engaged developer community.\n\nMore than 100 global partners and protocols are committed to launching on Linea mainnet.\n\n![|548.3761663043992x346.38966281791863](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/3SV8rNrgaImVdrUQe477aAfzbcPcw48RlEdxvDjsvBorhicWCEH4IglX-VCtNXSMkqGuaT-VvN1YTyu5BBeFKF7TsHy2fei3rWcfOaTf4HhLw5OrompyE1_BlJtu7iztEVGInOpz_efMakkVy38CJwo)\n\n### Vortex - Lattice-Based SNARKs\n\nLinea's exciting feature is its ability to consolidate transactions and submit proofs to the Ethereum main net using a novel prover mechanism with impressive performance and efficiency. This process increases throughput and reduces transaction fees while maintaining the inherent security of the Ethereum network.\n\nVortex, a cryptographic primitive developed at Consensys, is designed to boost Linea's performance. It employs a new type of zkProof known as a recursive aggregation proof based on Ring-SIS, a fundamental concept in lattice-based cryptography. This proofing system enables transaction batching, which enhances the network's throughput and reduces fees. Linea also uses zk circuits for computations, which aids in secure and efficient calculations.\n\n![Vortex|534x294.4](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/HTqoK2NzqeDBXGLj0MT2wieswaN4Fmj_6kGRmJoy8YX1YSPUllMiVMyr-qfbSjWxIAmQsb2rO2qPH2vgNo53eHdGNgNWaDhRs1WBT3eSTETFpi54dWDZqsKMVk9vPfoI3Va_kYY3JbpsT5uhgXGTwhw)\n\n## Motivation\n\n### Market Adoption\n\nLinea allows Aave to leverage the Consensys product suite distribution instantly. Linea prioritizes User Experience (UX), aiming to eliminate barriers for MetaMask's impressive community of 30M MAUs. By securing native support in the default MetaMask network dropdown list, Linea enhances user convenience and fully supports all MetaMask curated experiences. These include On/Off Ramp, MetaBridge, MetaMask Swaps, the Portfolio dApp, and the MetaMask SDK, presenting numerous opportunities for incorporating the Aave protocol.\n\n![|567.7854671280277x358.33572179744243](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ZXbCk4Wp55U6KmwfWtLo0c-s_TYgR7N2fGQeNGYFUGGS10dJcExeO4J1yi4y7nl5bs3ihs0GxXnMzNEg7FknnQvdsuS0e2iV6LuVu4hU0o1uiVAv8PA6Jzs-INGplFb98wUvxKCILlEZmBRsTQuP7JE)\n\nThe symbiotic relationship between Linea and Consensys products, specifically MetaMask, presents clear benefits. MetaMask is pivotal to bootstrapping Linea's activity through simple onboarding, while Linea plays a significant role in supporting MetaMask's future evolution.\n\n### Key Aave Benefits\n\nSome key benefits to Aave regarding the testnet and mainnet deployments include:\n\n1. **Establishment of Aave markets and $GHO on Linea** - Linea's integration with the ConsenSys product suite provides Aave access to a vast and well-established user base that will facilitate distribution and onboarding for the Linea network. This enables smoother distribution and adoption of Aave markets and $GHO. The strategic alignment bolsters Aave's market reach and stimulates fresh opportunities for user engagement, ultimately contributing to Aave's growth and visibility.\n\n2. **Being a Linea Launch Partner** - Consensys is organizing a significant promotion for the Linea mainnet expected in July. This includes marketing initiatives, partner highlights, IRL, and online presence. Aave benefits from these efforts through its testnet deployment and subsequent mainnet approval.\n\n### Aave <> Linea Values Alignment\n\nAAVE and Linea are committed to advancing decentralized systems and fostering innovation in the DeFi space. Both products prioritize growth and development of next-generation applications, with AAVE encouraging innovation in DeFi, and Linea enabling developers and enterprises worldwide to build modern financial infrastructure. Moreover, AAVE's focus on community engagement and investment in startups that add value to the ecosystem echoes Linea and ConsenSys' mission to serve millions of users and support a robust developer community.\n\n### Existing Collaboration Efforts\n\nThe Linea Team successfully conducted a \"First Class Linea Citizen\" campaign, seamlessly incorporating sybil protection into quest activities. This initiative resulted from a collaborative effort between Linea, Aave, and the Lens team to integrate the Lens tech stack into the Linea network.\n\nCreating Lineaster (Lens stack) on the testnet yielded impressive results, with over 257K Lens handles established, accompanied by more than 192K posts, 130K follow actions, and 10K comments. While not directly related to Aave, these results showcase the successful collaborative efforts between Aave-related entities and the Linea team.\n\n### Bridge Security\n\nThe Linea team operates and maintains a canonical Open Messaging Service (OMS), allowing messages to pass to and from Ethereum & Linea. The Ethereum network verifies smart contracts on the L1 that enforce a valid state on Linea. The canonical OMS leverages our zk prover to maintain verifiability.\n\nMoreover, the design implements a trustless relayer and leverages the rollup to maintain state/security. There are plans to secure the bridge (relayer) through decentralization; however, the priority remains on decentralizing the prover and sequencer.\n\nFor a technical walk-through of the cross-chain messaging functionality, please see [Linea Documentation](https://docs.linea.build/developers/use-message-bridge#l1-to-l2).\n\n## Specification [Technical Considerations]\n\nThis proposal presents Aave governance with the opportunity to deploy Aave V3 on the Linea testnet before its mainnet launch.\n\n**Oracles** - While the network is not currently integrated with Chainlink, the integration is expected to be completed shortly after the mainnet. In the meantime, for the testnet phase, Linea will collaborate with Aave to find suitable alternatives. It's important to note that Linea already operates with several Oracle providers, including Redstone and Umbrella.\n\n**Implementation** - The authors of this proposal are committed to working closely with the relevant parties to determine the most suitable asset and market factors for the mainnet proposal. Given that this pertains to a testnet deployment, the asset and market factors will be managed directly through Linea, ensuring an organized and effective execution.\n\n**Governance** - This proposal represents a collaborative effort between the Aave community (specifically Flipside) and Consensys/Linea. This proposal was not sponsored in any way. This ensures transparent, fair, and comprehensive governance procedures that align with the interests of all involved parties.\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nLinea nor Consensys has not compensated Flipside to create this proposal and Flipside is doing this because we believe that the deployment would be in the best interest of the Aave.\n\nAll information provided above is from public sources or from the Linea team directly.\n\nThis TEMP CHECK has been prepared solely to facilitate community discussion.\n\n## Next Steps\n\nFollowing a standard 7-day discussion period, Flipside will work with the community to trigger a Snapshot for a vote for testnet deployment. The Linea team will handle all technical deployment activities. Linea will also engage with necessary parties to complete all required work.\n\nFrom here, we will openly communicate progress with the community and the intended progression when all technical dependencies are met. These activities ensure that Aave can be a Linea launch partner in July.",

        "body": "**Title:** Aave Treasury Proposal: Onboard with Centrifuge Prime to invest in RWA\n\n**Author:** @Khan \n\n**Date:** Sep 12, 2023\n\n---\n\n### **Summary**\n\nThis proposal brings on Centrifuge as a service provider to the Aave DAO to setup a legal structure to support RWA investments, develop RWA specific management and governance processes, and allocate $1M of the Aave Treasury’s stablecoin holdings to a liquid US T-Bill fund on Centrifuge, as a proof of concept investment.\n\nThis is a first step towards a long term effort for Aave to develop and launch an RWA Facilitator that will back GHO with Real World Assets. With this proposal Aave can earn yield on idle stablecoins, establish long-term RWA infrastructure for the protocol, and allow the Aave DAO to begin building internal familiarity and expertise in the RWA industry.\n\nThe proposal minimizes upfront cost and completely recoups the initial investment within 6-12mo and starts earning yield for Aave within the first 3mo. It locks up no long term capital and leaves the DAO in full control over the treasury allocation.\n\nThe main results of this proposal:\n1. Aave will onboard to Centrifuge Prime to establish the legal and technical infrastructure for the Aave protocol to invest in RWAs.\n1. Through Prime, the Aave Treasury will allocate $1M of USDC to the Anemoy LTF, a short-duration US treasury bill pool on Centrifuge.\n\n### **Motivation**\n\nAave has long been a contributor and supporter of RWA initiatives. Since the first announcement of GHO, the Aave community has consistently expressed its interest in expanding into this area. Treasury Management at Aave has historically been focused on strategic crypto assets, ignoring the returns and liquidity available in offchain markets for various reasons.\n\nToday, with roughly 17% of the treasury in stablecoins (~13m USD), the Aave DAO is overlooking the 5% available interest in the risk-free rate of overnight financing of US treasury assets. This can offer $250,000 of recurring revenue a year at just 5m USD of investment. These markets can immediately become some of the highest earning revenue streams for the DAO.\n\nBeyond just economics, this proposal would allow the Aave DAO to establish and begin developing the internal RWA expertise necessary to engage with these markets. Centrifuge Prime is purpose-built for DeFi native organizations, offering the critical services and infrastructure necessary to onboard a diverse portfolio of RWA through a single interface.\n\nCentrifuge has a long track record of working with DAOs to bring RWA on as collateral, and pioneered the first Aave deployment into RWA with the joint development of the RWA Market. Onboarding Aave to Centrifuge Prime for liquid investment strategies is an optimal approach for scaling RWA with the Aave community. It will develop the legal and technical infrastructure necessary to interface with RWAs safely and efficiently, while allowing the Aave community to get comfortable and familiar with the processes and thinking around RWA. This will put Aave in a significantly improved position to be able to leverage RWA collateral for GHO in the long term, either to improve liquidity or develop additional revenue streams.\n\n### **Specification**\n\n#### **Setting up the Aave DAO Legal Conduit**\nThis proposal instructs Centrifuge to initiate the setup of a legal structure for the benefit of the Aave DAO that will be ratified and deployed by a subsequent Aave token holder vote.\n\nThe process for establishing the legal framework is as follows: The Centrifuge contributor team will retain external legal counsel in the Cayman Islands to represent the Aave DAOs interests. The legal structure itself will be established per the previously discussed legal framework developed by Centrifuge. The defining documents and legal agreement team will be created to incorporate specific processes around the DAOs interaction with the foundation company. The results of this work will be presented to the Aave DAO, an analysis from the external counsel will be provided, and the community will have time to process, provide feedback, and otherwise request changes in the legal structure. The structure will only be implemented and executed with DAO approval, likely via Snapshot or other requisite process as requested by the community.\n\nThe legal structure will be integrated with DAO governance through a process defined in the legal documents, is capable of investing and holding assets on behalf of the DAO, and ultimately allow the Aave DAO full legal recourse to their investments. The legal counsel, while required under local Cayman law, is retained for the purposes of having an independent legal party to protect Aave’s interest.\n\nThe structure defines the actions the foundation can take, such as initiating investments or redemptions. Any action can be made only with approval from the DAO and providing a DAO approved “resolution” to the Foundation entity described above instructing the Foundation to act in accordance with the resolution. The specific details of this process will be developed alongside the Aave community.\n\nThis framework is based on our extensive experience in MakerDAO setting up similar structures 1. There, the same structure is used to support a >$1.2B debt ceiling, with >600m+ actively deployed.\n\nMore information on the fund, the legal framework, and the processes described here can be found in the [on going FAQ discussion here.](https://governance.aave.com/t/centrifuge-rwa-proposal-discussion-and-q-a/14681)\n\n#### **Initial pilot investment in Anemoy Liquid Treasury Fund**\n\nOnce the legal structure has been defined and implemented, a specific DAO resolution will be presented to the DAO that instructs the Foundation to perform a 1M investment into the Anemoy LTF and transfers 1M USDC from the DAOs treasury into the Anemoy pool onchain.\nCentrifuge will work with Aave to do an initial test investment and then a partial redemption to test out the complete rails.\n\n#### **Scaling beyond the first transaction**\n\nIt is best for Aave to deploy into RWAs slowly. This proposal creates an initial deployment into the Anemoy Liquid Treasury Fund of $1M (pending DAO approval at the time investment). It is up to the community to initiate further investments, but we recommend keeping RWA allocations at a fixed cap of the overall Aave balance sheet until the community is more comfortable.\n\nFrom there on, further investment and redemption actions are in full control of the Aave DAO. The process can easily be integrated to support portfolio and allocation decisions made through a more formal treasury management process, either manually or programmatically. Centrifuge is committed to supporting these efforts for the duration of this proposal’s stream.\n\nOutside of US treasuries, the Centrifuge Prime setup would also allow the Aave DAO to allocate into the following asset classes in the future:\n\n| Bucket| Description | Target Return | Liquidity\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|Liquid | Lowest risk while maintaining US Treasuries, MMF, AA+ rated short term bonds| 5-6% | Daily\n| Preservation | Investments in senior secured loans such as real estate, corporate bonds etc. | 6-8% | 3-6 months\n| Acceleration | Trade finance, non-bank originators, emerging markets | 8-20% | 3-24mo |\n\n#### **Summary Process**\nIn summary, the following process will be executed through this proposal:\n1. Acquire Caymans Legal Counsel\n1. Conduct initial legal research and analysis alongside counsel, share to forum\n1. Post proposed legal documents and legal arrangement to forum, host community call, gather and implement community feedback. Arrangement will include explicit processes for management of the foundation company (i.e. investments and redemptions).\n1. DAO approval of legal implementation\n1. Foundation company onboards to Anemoy LTF\n1. DAO proposal request for 1m of USDC investment into Anemoy LTF\n\n\n**Estimated Timeline & Project Phases**\n\n\n| Activity | Description | Est. Time |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|Legal setup | Creation of Foundation Company, passing of DAO resolutions to start deployment into RWAs | 1-2 months\n| Initial Deployment | DAO instructs Foundation to deploy $1M into a US Treasuries Fund and transfers $1M in USDC Stablecoins into the Anemoy LTF | 2-3mo\n| Scaling up / Ongoing Operation | DAO can vote on increase allocation to Prime and direct investments towards a variety of liquid lower yielding and more longer term investments at any time | After 3mo\n\n#### **Fees**\nWhile there are some legal setup costs that have to be covered by the DAO upfront we limit these as much as possible.\n\nEven at a conservative deployment of just $2M and a portfolio return equal to current US Treasury yields Aave should break-even within the first 6mo and start generating revenue for the DAO thereafter.\n\nThe legal work will be useful far beyond this initial proposal and can be the basis on which Aave onboards RWAs into GHO.\n\n**Fees**\n| Fee | Amount | Details |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Legal Setup | up to 50,000 USDC | To be paid immediately into a Safe controlled by Centrifuge to pay for lawyers and Cayman service providers to set up a Cayman foundation company to the benefit of the Aave DAO, any unused budget will be returned to the Aave treasury.\n|Portfolio Fee | 0.35% p.a. on assets in Prime up to $50M, 0.2% $50-100M, 0.1% >$100M | Paid on an ongoing basis to Centrifuge for maintaining the portfolio\n|Aave Reward | 500 stkAave streamed over 2 years into the Centrifuge treasury, starting with the first 1M UDSC Deployment into Centrifuge Prime |To cover costs of resource and facilitation time for the development of the infrastructure and processes. Centrifuge DAO intends for this to create better alignment with strong skin in the game incentives for success.\n\n### **Summary of changes & discussion with the community since the Temp Check**\n* In discussion:\n    * Provided more details on the legal framework\n    * Provided more details on the Anemoy LTF\n    * Hosted individual and group calls with active delegates and voting participants to answer questions and provide further context\n    * Hosted a public Twitter Space\n* In this ARFC:\n    * Modified the proposal to focus primarily on an initial 1m RWA investment, with further investments explicitly out of scope\n    * Specified Aave Reward to be paid out only upon deployment of the initial investment\n    * Further explanation of legal constructs\n    * Further explanation on use of funds\n    * Defined a more detailed and explicit process for the establishment of the legal framework\n    * Defined a more detailed and explicit process for the initial 1m investment\n    * Breakout of proposal delivery steps and phase\n### **Additional Resources**\n* [Temp Check Proposal](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-aave-treasury-proposal-for-rwa-allocation/14381)\n* [Further Discussion and Q&A](https://governance.aave.com/t/centrifuge-rwa-proposal-discussion-and-q-a/14681)\n* [Centrifuge Prime Announcement](https://medium.com/centrifuge/introducing-centrifuge-prime-real-yields-real-defi-b97a0e767f18)\n* [A Discussion on a GHO Real World Asset Facilitator](https://governance.aave.com/t/a-discussion-on-a-gho-real-world-asset-facilitator/11908/5)\n### **Disclaimer:**\nThis proposal is written by a member of the k/factory team, a core contributor to the Centrifuge protocol.\n### **Next Steps:**\nUpon approval, Centrifuge will work with the DAO to implement and execute the AIP.\n### **Copyright:**\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.",
