It is the largest LST protocol and the 3rd highest TVL protocol on the Metis network. artMETIS is a liquid wrapper of the staked METIS on Artemis and accrues the staking rewards directly. Therefore, 1 artMETIS can always be redeemed to more than 1 METIS.\n\nartMETIS liquidity is concentrated in artMETIS/METIS pair on Hercules, allowing for swap of 100 artMETIS to METIS with less than 0.5% slippage. The pool TVL currently has $3.43M and is available [here](https://app.hercules.exchange/pools/0xfd1F58C4c05d8Ed5040eE9bA7eDb5Cc5bf53930E).\n\nartMETIS can also be utilized as collateral on [Shoebill](https://metis-metis.shoebill.finance/#/) METIS market, enabling users to borrow assets and access liquidity by leveraging their artMETIS holdings. artMETIS is the top supply asset on Shoebill with over $3 million TVL.\n\n### Benefits of listing artMETIS\n\nWe believe that listing artMETIS will bring significant benefits to all parties involved and is a strategic decision that aligns with the goals of Aave.\n\n- Increased liquidity. The addition of artMETIS introduces an opportunity for users to borrow and lend LSTs.\n- Market expansion and user adoption. The listing of artMETIS has the potential to attract new users to the Aave platform.\n- Leveraged lending is a crucial use case for lending platforms. It not only brings more TVL and users to the platform but also significantly incentivizes genuine lending activity. This, in turn, generates more fee revenue for the project.\n- AAVE's artMETIS assets will receive an additional weekly incentive of $5000-$10000 in oMETIS (Option Metis), along with an extra 1X ART Points. These points will be eligible for future Artemis airdrops.\n\n### Chain to be deployed/listed\n\nartMETIS will be listed on Aave V3 Metis market with the following specifications.\n\nTicker: artMETIS\n\nContract Address: [0x2583A2538272f31e9A15dD12A432B8C96Ab4821d](https://andromeda-explorer.metis.io/address/0x2583A2538272f31e9A15dD12A432B8C96Ab4821d)\n\nChainlink Oracle: 0x96C4A48Abdf781e9c931cfA92EC0167Ba219ad8E\n\nRisk Parameters will be provided at ARFC stage by Risk Service Providers.\n\n### Proof of Liquidity (POL) and Deposit Commitments:\n\nThe Metis Foundation has shown strong commitment to supporting Artemis by committing 10k METIS and 10k artMETIS tokens to provide liquidity on Hercules DEX.\n\nFurthermore, the launch of Metis sequencers has sparked interest from institutional investors who are looking to invest and stake the METIS token. Artemis, as a leading liquid staking protocol for METIS, has actively engaged with these investors and successfully onboarded them to stake their METIS tokens with Artemis.\n\nArtemis has implemented a points system that incentivizes the initial liquidity bootstrap and user activity on various platforms. By supplying and borrowing artMETIS tokens on Aave, users can earn additional points and become eligible for the Artemis token airdrop.\n\nIn recognition of Artemis's efforts, the Metis Foundation has provided official grants to support the development of DeFi use cases for artMETIS. Part of this grant will be allocated to incentivize users on Aave.\n\nIn summary, the commitment of the Metis Foundation to provide initial liquidity, collaborations with external parties to bootstrap liquidity, implementation of liquidity mining programs, support for staking and yield farming opportunities, and the provision of grants to incentivize the user activity on Aave all contribute to a strong proof of liquidity and deposit commitments. These factors demonstrate the significant value and potential growth that the listing of artMETIS can bring to the Aave ecosystem.\n\n### **Useful Links:**\n\nWebsite:\n\nhttps://artemisfinance.io/\n\nX:\n\nhttps://x.com/Artemisfinance\n\nDocuments:\n\nhttps://docs.artemisfinance.io/\n\nAudit Report:\n\nhttps://docs.artemisfinance.io/audit\n\nDefillama:\n\nhttps://defillama.com/protocol/artemis-finance\n\n### Disclaimer:\n\nThis proposal is powered by Skywards.

        "body": "---\nTitle: [ARFC] Onboard ggAVAX to Aave V3 on Avalanche \nDate: 2024-04-29\nAuthor: ACI (Aave-chan Initiative)\n---\n\n## Summary:\n\nThe current proposal is set to add ggAVAX, a liquid staking AVAX token issued by the Gogopool protocol, to the AAVE V3 Avalanche market.\n\n### Motivation\n\nGoGoPool is one of the largest Avalanche DeFi protocols. It is ranked number 6 on the Avalanche C-Chain in terms of TVL chain and currently controls more than 500k AVAX (~$23M at current market prices).\n\nWe believe there is currently very large underserved demand for borrowing AVAX against ggAVAX, as ggAVAX is the highest-yielding LST on Avalanche. The APYs currently range between 7% and 8%, which is on the order of 33% more yield than any existing competitors on Avalanche. \n\nBeing the highest-yielding LST on Avalanche makes ggAVAX perfect for being a collateral asset, especially for those who seek leveraged exposure to native AVAX yields.\n\n \n![dd93fbd27bc1aac727035529eb5ff6253f57edc8.png](ipfs://bafkreibcfworgked4rc5maanvobvklqy6rmwchfk7rjyoswvyd2chpzsbu)\n    \n\n\nThis yield is achieved through a mix of no protocol fees, running validators instead of utilizing delegation mechanisms, and generating MEV yield from positive market interactions (see dashboard for more details: [Flipside](https://flipsidecrypto.xyz/GoGoPool/ggp-protocol-stats-PitGzK)). \n\nThere is currently more than ~80k AVAX in the ggAVAX-AVAX pools across Balancer and Wombat, making it the most liquid Avalanche LST relative to its size.\n\n \n![8867ec44b2d0dc326eaf4b928b7d7c889eb5f113.png](ipfs://bafkreig3f2xualvcqedjubvgg66tj3jwfkccocvm53l5dc5xtmmo6r5px4)\n    \n\n\nBesides the deep on-chain liquidity, ggAVAX allows users to redeem ggAVAX for underlying AVAX at an internal rate and with no fees. These redemptions are instant as long as there is enough AVAX in the ggAVAX smart contract to facilitate them.\n\nGoGoPool is backed by the Avalanche Foundation and industry-leading investors. In 2022, It raised $7.5M in two rounds [led by Framework Ventures and Coinfund and](https://www.theblock.co/post/166498/gogopool-raises-5-million-to-provide-decentralized-staking-on-avalanche?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social) with participation from Silverstone Ventures, Fintech Collective, and Avalaunch. \n\nThe protocol has been [audited by Zellic](https://github.com/Zellic/publications/blob/master/GoGoPool%20-%20Zellic%20Audit%20Report.pdf) and [Kudelski Security](https://assets-global.website-files.com/62f90a8443126c2ee50f4c4e/643ee88bf91b375b39ba2613_Kudelski_multisig_labs_report_1.1.pdf) with an additional [Code4rena](https://docs.gogopool.com/audits/code4rena-audit) audit contest. It also has an ongoing [bug bounty program with Immunefi](https://immunefi.com/bounty/gogopool/).\n\n### Benefits of listing ggAVAX\n\nListing of ggAVAX on AAVE would create additional demand for borrowing AVAX (in E-Mode) and other assets. Since ggAVAX generates consistently higher yields than other LSTs, borrowers can tolerate higher interest payments, leading to AVAX utilisation and revenue for the DAO.\n\nCurrently, AVAX utilisation sits well below the Optimal Utilisation Rate. More than $30M in borrow demand is required to bring utilisation from 43% to 65%. Listing a new high-yielding LST as collateral will help create this additional borrowing demand, resulting in higher utilisation rates, higher APRs for AVAX lenders and higher income for the  AAVE Ecosystem Reserve. \n\n### Chain to be deployed/listed\n\nAave V3 on Avalanche.\n\n### Technical Details\n\nWith the recent implementation of [Price Cap Adapters (CAPO)](https://app.aave.com/governance/v3/proposal/?proposalId=51), ggAVAX can be listed using an internal rate oracle without relying only on the AVAX/USD ChainLink price feed. This is the same approach that AAVE currently uses for sAVAX, wstETH, cbETH, weETH and other LSTs (and LRTs)\n\nggAVAX’s CAPO, however, might require a max growth ratio higher than the 10.1% currently set for sAVAX to account for a generally higher level of yield.\n\nWe welcome any questions about ggAVAX architecture and protocol structure and look forward to working on this with the DAO.\n\n### Specification\n\n|Parameter|Value|\n|---|---|\n|Isolation Mode|No|\n|Borrowable|No|\n|Collateral Enabled|Yes|\n|Supply Cap (ggAVAX)|70,000|\n|Borrow Cap (ggAVAX)|NA|\n|Debt Ceiling|NA|\n|LTV|30.00%|\n|LT|40.00%|\n|Liquidation Bonus|10.00%|\n|Liquidation Protocol Fee|10.00%|\n|Variable Base|0.0%|\n|Variable Slope1|NA|\n|Variable Slope2|NA|\n|Uoptimal|NA|\n|Reserve Factor|NA|\n|Stable Borrowing|Disabled|\n|Flashloanable|Yes|\n|Siloed Borrowing|No|\n|Borrowed in Isolation|No|\n|Emode|No|\n\n\n### Proof of Liquidity (POL)  and Deposit Commitments\n\nGoGoPool has earmarked 10k GGP tokens (worth +100K USD at average 90-day prices) for incentivising ggAVAX deposits into AAVE over the first three months of the listing to help bootstrap the market adoption and attract leverage takers.\n\nAfter the listing is complete, we plan to work tightly with Avalanche ecosystem partners to integrate the market into their products. This can include autocompounding vaults, composite strategies and auto-leverage vaults. \n\nThese and other integrations would help drive usage to the ggAVAX market specifically and AAVE in general. Note that we have already had preliminary talks with a number of protocols on this subject.\n\n### Useful Links\n\n[Website](https://www.gogopool.com/) \n\n[Github](https://github.com/multisig-labs/)\n\n[Flipside](https://flipsidecrypto.xyz/GoGoPool/ggp-protocol-stats-PitGzK) \n\n[Twitter](https://twitter.com/gogopool_)\n\n[Docs](https://docs.gogopool.com/)\n\n### Disclaimer\n\nThis proposal is powered by Skywards.

Users wishing to utilize their Bitcoin on Ethereum can use the tBTC decentralized bridge to deposit their Bitcoin into the system and get a minted tBTC token in their Ethereum wallet.\n\nHaving recently acquired a Chainlink oracle, tBTC enables Aave users to have access to the only wrapped Bitcoin, which can be permissionlessly minted and redeemed, where the BTC that backs it is not held by a central intermediary, but is instead held by a decentralized network of nodes using threshold cryptography. This implies a fully decentralized and permissionless lending and borrowing experience for BTC (i.e. bridge native BTC to tBTC and borrow via Aave).\n\ntBTC was created by a decentralized effort of contributors at the Threshold Network DAO, and extensively utilizes the Threshold Network’s threshold cryptography to create a secure BTC asset. tBTC is a product launched on Threshold Network, on which many other decentralized applications are being built.\n\nThreshold Network DAO was born out of the first on-chain merger between two decentralized protocols, Keep Network and NuCypher early in 2022. The DAO has successfully operated since that time, and supports an active community of contributors that work towards building tBTC liquidity and usability.\n\n### Benefits for Aave:\n\n- Further decentralization and trust minimisation in the Aave stack.\n- A range of lending options for those who wish to earn yield on their BTC.\n- Collaboration with the Threshold Network DAO, opening up the opportunity to incorporate other Threshold products (such as Threshold Access Control and thUSD) into the Aave offering.\n- Preferable yields on tBTC through active incentive participation, boosting Aave protocol use, fees and TVL.\n- Additional incentive allocation originating from Arbitrium’s LTIPP.\n\n## Specification\n\nTicker: TBTC\n\nContract Addresses:\n\nEthereum: 0x18084fba666a33d37592fa2633fd49a74dd93a88\n\nArbitrum: 0x6c84a8f1c29108f47a79964b5fe888d4f4d0de40\n\nOptimism: 0x6c84a8f1c29108F47a79964b5Fe888D4f4D0dE40\n\nChainlink Oracle:\n\nEthereum: 0x8350b7De6a6a2C1368E7D4Bd968190e13E354297\n\nArbitrum: 0xE808488e8627F6531bA79a13A9E0271B39abEb1C\n\nOptimism: 0x5a61374950D4BFa5a3D4f2CA36FC1d23A92b6f21\n\n### Risk parameters\n Parameter | Value |\n| --- | --- |\n| Isolation Mode | No |\n| Borrowable | Yes |\n| Collateral Enabled | Yes |\n| Supply Cap (tBTC) | 550 |\n| Borrow Cap (tBTC) | 275 |\n| Debt Ceiling | - |\n| LTV | 73.00% |\n| LT | 78.00% |\n| Liquidation Bonus | 7.50% |\n| Liquidation Protocol Fee | 10.00% |\n| Variable Base | 0.0% |\n| Variable Slope1 | 4.00% |\n| Variable Slope2 | 300.00% |\n| Uoptimal | 45.00% |\n| Reserve Factor | 20.00% |\n| Stable Borrowing | Disabled |\n| Flashloanable | Yes |\n| Siloed Borrowing | No |\n| Borrowed in Isolation | No |\n\n**CAPO**\n| Price Cap |\n| --- |\n| 4% |\n\n### Emission schedule\n\ntBTC is one-to-one backed with real Bitcoin, meaning that there isn’t an emissions schedule, but a mint and redeem function that adjusts the supply of tBTC based on native BTC coming into and out of the system.\n\n### Risks\n\nFor tBTC, wallets are created periodically based on governance. In order for the wallet to move funds, it produces signatures using a Threshold Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm, requiring 51-of-100 Signers to cooperate. The 100 signers on each wallet are chosen with our Sortition Pool, and the randomness is provided by the Random Beacon. More can be found here - [Wallet Generation  Threshold Docs](https://docs.threshold.network/applications/tbtc-v2/wallet-generation)\n\nThe Threshold Council multisig is a 6/9 Gnosis Safe multisig with 9 unique signers that form the Threshold Network Council. The Council has limited upgrade privileges over the smart contracts. However, those privileges do not include any custodial power over deposited BTC:\n\nCouncil Multisig Ethereum Address: 0x9F6e831c8F8939DC0C830C6e492e7cEf4f9C2F5f\n\n### Useful Links:\n\n[Project](https://www.threshold.network/)\n\n[Minting dashboard](https://dashboard.threshold.network/tBTC/mint)\n\n[GitHub](https://github.com/keep-network/tbtc-v2)\n\n[Docs](https://docs.threshold.network/applications/tbtc-v2)\n\n[Audit](https://threshold.network/about#audits)\n\n[Immunfi Bug Bounty](https://immunefi.com/bounty/thresholdnetwork/)\n\n[Llama Risk Report Collateral Risk Assessment Threshold BTC tBTC - HackMD](https://hackmd.io/@LlamaRisk/tBTC)\n\n[Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/thetnetwork)\n\n[Discord](https://wdiscord.gg/threshold)\n\n[Dune](https://dune.com/threshold/tbtc https://dune.com/sensecapital/tbtc-liquidity)\n\n## Disclaimer:\n\nThis proposal is powered by Skywards.

        "body": "---\n**Title:** [ARFC] Onboarding of weETH to Aave v3 on Ethereum\n**Author:** Ether.fi & ACI ( Aave Chan Initiative)\n**Date:** 2024-02-27\n\n---\n### **Summary:**\n\nThe current ARFC seeks to add [Ether.fi](http://Ether.fi) Liquid Restaking Token weETH to Aave V3 Ethereum, after the successful [TEMP CHECK](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-onboarding-weeth-to-aave-v3-ethereum/16546) and [TEMP CHECK Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0xffe122a2fb0b34e713b7bb8e74e943b35c6cb298bafc4e50c464b62167e3246e).\n\nThe intention behind this initiative is to enhance the diversity of assets on Aave and bolster liquidity within the ecosystem.\n\n### Motivation:\n\neETH is an LRT that allows users to stake their ETH, accrue staking rewards, and receive additional rewards through native restaking on EigenLayer. As of February 3rd, approximately 290,310 ETH ($670M) in TVL has been deposited into the [ether.fi 1](http://ether.fi/) protocol, and XX has been natively restaked in EigenLayer.\n\n[Ether.fi](http://ether.fi/) stands as the pioneering decentralized and non-custodial delegated staking protocol featuring an LRT (eETH). A notable feature of [ether.fi](http://ether.fi/) is the control it provides stakers over their keys. The team behind the protocol is guided by the following principles:\n\n1. Decentralization is the foremost objective. [Ether.fi](http://ether.fi/) is unwavering in its commitment to maintain the protocol's non-custodial and decentralized nature, ensuring that stakers always have control over their ETH.\n2. [Ether.fi](http://ether.fi/) operates as a legitimate business with a sustainable revenue model, with the team dedicated to its long-term success. There is no place for deceptive or unsustainable financial practices.\n3. [Ether.fi](http://ether.fi/) is committed to always acting in the best interest of the Ethereum community. In the event of any missteps, the team at [ether.fi](http://ether.fi/) will take responsibility and swiftly rectify the situation.\n\nRisks:\n\n[ether.fi](http://ether.fi/)’s LRT eETH is 100% redeemable. Users who deposit ETH into the protocol can withdraw their stake at any time. The holdings are publicly auditable on-chain and the protocol retains healthy reserves to offset any losses.\n\n## Proof of Liquidity and Deposit Commitments:\n\nAnyone who deposits weETH into Aave will accumulate [ether.fi](http://ether.fi/)  and EigenLayer points to be used for future incentives.\n\nUsers are given eETH on a 1:1 basis with a minimum deposit of 0.001 ETH. \n\n[ether.fi](http://ether.fi/) is also the first LSP to natively restake on EigenLayer — a move that helps improve network efficiency and provides stakers with additional rewards for their network contributions. [ether.fi](http://ether.fi/) has also launched a series of partnerships with DeFi protocols to incentivize users and drive liquidity (weETH) to various platforms.\n\n### Specification\n\n### Risk Parameters\n\nweETH: [0xCd5fE23C85820F7B72D0926FC9b05b43E359b7ee](https://etherscan.io/token/0xcd5fe23c85820f7b72d0926fc9b05b43e359b7ee)\n\n| Risk Parameters | Value |\n| --- | --- |\n| Isolation Mode | No |\n| Borrowable | Yes |\n| Collateral Enabled | Yes |\n| Supply Cap (weETH) | 8000 |\n| Borrow Cap (weETH) | 800 |\n| Debt Ceiling | - |\n| LTV | 72.50% |\n| LT | 75.00% |\n| Liquidation Bonus | 7.50% |\n| Liquidation Protocol Fee | 10.00% |\n| Variable Base | 0.0% |\n| Variable Slope1 | 7.00% |\n| Variable Slope2 | 300.00% |\n| Uoptimal | 45.00% |\n| Reserve Factor | 15.00% |\n| Stable Borrowing | Disabled |\n| Flashloanable | Yes |\n| Siloed Borrowing | No |\n| Borrowed in Isolation | No |\n| E-Mode Category | ETH-correlated |\n\n### **Useful Links**\n\n[Ether.fi](https://www.ether.fi/)\n\n[TEMP CHECK](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-onboarding-weeth-to-aave-v3-ethereum/16546)\n\n[TEMP CHECK Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0xffe122a2fb0b34e713b7bb8e74e943b35c6cb298bafc4e50c464b62167e3246e)\n\n### Disclaimer\n\nThis proposal is powered by Skywards.
