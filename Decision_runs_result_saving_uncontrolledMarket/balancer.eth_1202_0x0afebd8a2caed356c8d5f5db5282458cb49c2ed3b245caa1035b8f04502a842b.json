        "body": "### PR with Payload\nhttps://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/1267\n\n### Summary\n\nThis is a proposal to enable one uncapped Balancer gauge for a sUSDe/GYD E-CLP on Ethereum. \n\nWe propose to only enable protocol fees of 50% once rewards start. The entire protocol fees will accrue to Balancer, while Gyroscope will not take any cut at this point.\n\n### References/Useful links\n\n* [Documentation of E-CLPs](https://docs.gyro.finance/gyroscope-protocol/concentrated-liquidity-pools/e-clps)\n* [Website](https://gyro.finance/)\n* [Github](https://github.com/gyrostable)\n* [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/2vnqnS7wE6)\n* [X](https://twitter.com/GyroStable)\n\n---\n\n### Protocol description\n\n* sUSDe accrues rewards and can be obtained by staking USDe. USDe is a \"delta-neutral synthetic dollar\" issued by [Ethena](https://ethena.fi/).\n* GYD is a USD denominated stablecoin, issued by the [Gyroscope protocol](https://gyro.finance/).\n\n---\n\n### Motivation\n\nGyroscope is further expanding its liquidity network around GYD by adding a direct route to sUSDe.\n\n---\n\n### Specifications\n\n#### Governance\n\nThe Gyroscope Protocol will be governed by a DAO and relevant stakeholder with the full launch on Ethereum. For now, the FTL Labs multi-sig can pause the pool, change the swap fee and set the protocol fee. As a custom pool by Gyroscope, the E-CLP will be controlled by Gyroscope governance upon its launch.\n\n#### Oracles\n\n* ‘rateProvider0’: sUSDe rate provider on Ethereum: [0x3A244e6B3cfed21593a5E5B347B593C0B48C7dA1](https://etherscan.io/address/0x3a244e6b3cfed21593a5e5b347b593c0b48c7da1)\nand relevant [review](https://github.com/balancer/code-review/blob/main/rate-providers/sUSDERateProviderMainnet.md).\n* ‘rateProvider1’: GYD rate provider on Ethereum: 0x00\n\n#### Audits\n\nAudit reports by Nethermind, Trail of Bits, and Runtime Verification can be accessed here (the E-CLP is called the “CEMM” in these reports). In addition, the E-CLP code has been live in production on Polygon since November 2022.\n\n#### Centralization vectors\n\nNo centralization vectors. The FTL Labs team’s multi-sig can - currently - pause the pool, change the swap fee and set the protocol fee.\n\n#### Market History\n\n* The Gyroscope Protocol is live on Ethereum since EOY23, with E-CLPs on several other chains. Details available [here ](https://dune.com/gyro_finance/gyroscope-e-clps).\n* This is the first sUSDe/ GYD pool.\n\n## Value\n\nAs per “Motivation”.\n\n---\n\n#### Contracts\n\n* E-CLP: [0x8d93b853849b9884e2bb413444ec23eb5366ee91](https://etherscan.io/address/0x8d93b853849b9884e2bb413444ec23eb5366ee91)\n* Gauge: [0x146b6030E6d6a6398B918E9854652a71C9537180](https://etherscan.io/address/0x146b6030E6d6a6398B918E9854652a71C9537180)",

        "body": "PR With Payload\nhttps://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/1359\n\n**Summary**\n> This is a proposal to enable one uncapped Balancer gauge on Ethereum for a wstETH/GYD E-CLP. \n\n**References/Useful links**\n\n> Links\n> * [Documentation of E-CLPs](https://docs.gyro.finance/gyroscope-protocol/concentrated-liquidity-pools/e-clps)\n> * [Website](https://gyro.finance/)\n> * [Github](https://github.com/gyrostable)\n> * [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/2vnqnS7wE6)\n> * [X](https://twitter.com/GyroStable)\n\n**Protocol Description**\n\n>* GYD is a USD denominated stablecoin, issued by [Gyroscope](https://gyro.finance/).\n>* wstETH is a static wrapper of stETH. stETH is a yield bearing token that represents staked ether in [Lido](https://help.lido.fi/en/articles/5230610-what-is-steth).\n\n\n**Motivation**\n\n> Gyroscope is launching further strategic pools.\n\n**Specification**\n \n>1. **Governance:** The Gyroscope Protocol will be governed by a DAO and relevant stakeholder with the full launch on Ethereum. For now, the FTL Labs multi-sig can pause the pool, change the swap fee and set the protocol fee. As a custom pool by Gyroscope, the E-CLP will be controlled by Gyroscope governance upon its launch.\n>\n>\n>2. **Oracles:** \n> * ‘rateProvider0’: wstETH rate provider on Ethereum: [0x72D07D7DcA67b8A406aD1Ec34ce969c90bFEE768](https://etherscan.io/address/0x72D07D7DcA67b8A406aD1Ec34ce969c90bFEE768)\nand relevant [review ](https://github.com/balancer/code-review/blob/main/rate-providers/wstethRateProvider.md).\n> *  ‘rateProvider1’: GYD rate provider on Ethereum: [0xD43F5a722e8e7355D790adda4642f392Dfb820a1](https://etherscan.io/address/0xD43F5a722e8e7355D790adda4642f392Dfb820a1).\n>\n>3. **Audits:** Audit reports by Nethermind, Trail of Bits, and Runtime Verification can be accessed here (the E-CLP is called the “CEMM” in these reports). In addition, the E-CLP code has been live in production since November 2022.\n>\n>4. **Centralization vectors:** No centralization vectors. The FTL Labs team’s multi-sig can - currently - pause the pool, change the swap fee and set the protocol fee.\n>\n>5. **Market History:** This is the first wstETH/GYD E-CLP on Ethereum.\n>\n>6. **Value:** This pool is intended to be the primary source of liquidity for the token(s). \n\n#### Contracts\n\n> * E-CLP: [0xC8cF54b0b70899Ea846B70361e62F3F5B22b1f4B](https://etherscan.io/address/0xC8cF54b0b70899Ea846B70361e62F3F5B22b1f4B)\n>* Gauge: [0xCda69C40176B98bB1773109d1fEa91e12F478451](https://etherscan.io/address/0xCda69C40176B98bB1773109d1fEa91e12F478451)\n\n\n#### Specification\n\n\n>Transaction: The Balancer Maxi LM Multisig `eth:0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd` and call the `addGauge` function with the following arguments:\n>\n>gauge(address): `0xCda69C40176B98bB1773109d1fEa91e12F478451`\n>gaugeType(string): `Ethereum`",
