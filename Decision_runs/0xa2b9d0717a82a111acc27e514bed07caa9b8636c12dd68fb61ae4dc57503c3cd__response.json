Built from the ground up, it delivers zero fees, lightning-fast transactions, and the robust security that stablecoins like USD₮ require. The network offers a performant location to the deploy the Aave protocol, and the Plasma team are planning to support Aave’s launch on the network. ## Specification Risk Parameters will be provided by Risk Service Providers during the ARFC stage and ARFC will be updated accordingly. > Proposal has been updated with latest Risk Parameters 2025-09-05 # Specification | **Parameter** | Value | Value | Value | **Value** | Value | Value | Value | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |  …\n\nVoting timeline analysis (no final tally):\n{\n  \"early_lead_hits\": [\n    35,\n    1,\n    0\n  ],\n  \"lead_hits_by_quartile\": [\n    [\n      35,\n      1,\n      0\n    ],\n    [\n      40,\n      0,\n      0\n    ],\n    [\n      19,\n      0,\n      0\n    ],\n    [\n      8,\n      0,\n      0\n    ]\n  ],\n  \"lead_hits_total\": [\n    102,\n    1,\n    0\n  ],\n  \"lead_ratio_by_quartile\": [\n    [\n      0.972222,\n      0.027778,\n      0.0\n    ],\n    [\n      1.0,\n      0.0,\n      0.0\n    ],\n    [\n      1.0,\n      0.0,\n      0.0\n    ],\n    [\n      1.0,\n …",
