Adding XAUt to Aave v3 would:\n\n1. Diversify the protocol's offerings with a historically stable store of value\n2. Enable users to use gold-backed tokens as collateral or for lending, creating new DeFi use cases\n3. Allow users a hedge against market volatility through exposure to physical gold\n4. Attract traditional finance users who are familiar with gold as an asset class\n\nThe addition of XAUt aligns with Aave's goal of expanding DeFi accessibility while maintaining strong risk management practices through the use of established, well-backed assets.\n\n### **Specification**\n\nTicker: XAUt\n\nContract address: \n\nRisk Parameters will be provided by Risk Services Providers at the earliest possible and ARFC will be updated with that feedback.\n\n### **Disclosure**\n\nACI (Aave Chan Initiative) is not afiliated with Tether and has not received compensation for creating this proposal.\n\n### **Next Steps**\n\n1. If consensus is reached on this [TEMP CHECK], escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n2. If the Snapshot outcome is YAE, this proposal will be escalated to ARFC stage.\n3. Publication of a standard ARFC, collect community & service providers feedback before escalating proposal to ARFC snapshot stage.\n4. If the ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, publish an AIP vote for final confirmation and enforcement of the proposal.\n\n### **Copyright**",

USDtb can be used the same way a holder would use any other dollar, whether to send and receive payments, acquire and trade assets, or to simply hold dollars.\n\nUnlike actual dollars, USDtb is a blockchain-based token, which enables faster and cheaper spending than the traditional fiat banking system. Unlike many digital assets, USDtb is fully backed by institutional-grade tokenized U.S. treasury fund products (alongside a stablecoin reserve designed to facilitate rapid redemptions) to support stability. Initially, USDtb will be backed by BlackRockâ€™s USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund Token, BUIDL.\n\nBy onboarding USDtb, deeper borrow liquidity will be generated to allow sUSDe leverage at an attractive borrow rate. We believe this will help revitalise and accelerate growth in sUSDe activity on the Core Instance.\n\nBacked by BUIDL issued by Blackrock, one of the largest asset managers in the world we believe this asset aligns well with Aaveâ€™s history of providing liquidity to the highest quality assets in DeFi and should attract significant deposits.\n\n### Specification\n\n- Onboard to Core Instance\n- Borrow enabled\n- Collateral disabled\n- L1 token contract address: 0xC139190F447e929f090Edeb554D95AbB8b18aC1C\n\nMore details will be shared on ARFC.\n\n### Proof of Liquidity and Deposit Commitments\n\n- Ethena will deposit a significant amount of USDtb.\n\n### **Useful Links:**\n\n- Docs: https://docs.usdtb.money/\n- Transparency dashboard: https://usdtb.money/transparency\n\n### Disclaimer:\n\nThis proposal is powered by Skywards. The Aave Chan Initiative is not directly affiliated with USDtb and did not receive compensation for creation this proposal.\n\n### Next Steps\n\n1. If consensus is reached on this [TEMP CHECK], escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n2. If the Snapshot outcome is YAE, this proposal will be escalated to ARFC stage\n3. Publication of a standard ARFC, collect community & service providers feedback before escalating proposal to ARFC snapshot stage\n4. If the ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, publish an AIP vote for final confirmation and enforcement of the proposal\n\n### Copyright:\n\nCopyright and related rights waived under [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)",

EURC is Circleâ€™s EUR-backed stablecoin, enhancing liquidity and expanding the platformâ€™s appeal to European users. Original proposal was [**[TEMP CHECK] Add EURC to BASE Aave V3**](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-add-eurc-to-base-aave-v3/20423) but has been reformatted to be governance compliant. It has also passed [TEMP CHECK Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/s:aave.eth/proposal/0x4ead0ee7c538878f1584b20f12ee99e62fb7e08517042b9820836cd9fe7375c7) .\n\n### **Motivation/Background:**\n\nEURC is a fully backed stablecoin pegged to the Euro, issued by Circle, the same entity behind USDC. It is a reliable and transparent Euro-denominated asset gaining adoption across DeFi protocols.\n\n- **Utility and Role:** EURC facilitates Euro-based transactions in DeFi, allowing for a stable store of value and an efficient medium of exchange within the ecosystem.\n- **Backers:** Circle is a trusted issuer with a track record of regulatory compliance, providing confidence in EURCâ€™s stability.\n- **Performance:** EURC has demonstrated consistent performance and adoption within the broader DeFi space such as Morpho (3M), Alien(4M) and Aerodome (3M).\n- **Euro Liquidity:** EURC will offer Aave users access to Euro-denominated liquidity, appealing to the European market.\n- **Broader User Base:** Listing EURC could attract new users from Europe, diversifying Aaveâ€™s stablecoin offerings.\n- **Increased Liquidity:** The addition of EURC can enhance liquidity across Aaveâ€™s markets, improving lending, borrowing, and trading experiences.\n\n### **Chain to be Deployed/Listed:**\n\n- **Chain:** Base\n- **LTV:** Proposed initial Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio is 75%, consistent with other stablecoins.\n- **Parameters: Updated based on Risk Service Providers feedback 2025-01-23\n\n| **Parameter** | **Value** |\n| --- | --- |\n| Isolation Mode | No |\n| Borrowable | Yes |\n| Collateral Enabled | Yes |\n| Supply Cap | 4,200,000 |\n| Borrow Cap | 3,800,000 |\n| Debt Ceiling | - |\n| LTV | 75.00% |\n| LT | 78.00% |\n| Liquidation Bonus | 5.00% |\n| Liquidation Protocol Fee | 10.00% |\n| Variable Base | 0% |\n| Variable Slope1 | 12% |\n| Variable Slope2 | 40% |\n| Uoptimal | 90% |\n| Reserve Factor | 10% |\n| Stable Borrowing | Disabled |\n| Flashloanable | Yes |\n| Borrowable in Isolation | No |\n| E-Mode Category | - |\n\n### Useful Links\n\nProject: [Circle | USDC & Web3 Services for a new financial system](https://www.circle.com/en/)\n\nDocumentation: [EURC | A Euro-Backed Stablecoin](https://www.circle.com/en/eurc)\n\nBase Contract: 0x60a3e35cc302bfa44cb288bc5a4f316fdb1adb42\n\nBase Chainlink Oracle: [EURC / USD Price Feed | Chainlink](https://data.chain.link/feeds/base/base/eurc-usd)\n\n[**[TEMP CHECK] Add EURC to BASE Aave V3 Instance**](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-add-eurc-to-base-aave-v3-instance/20626) \n\n[TEMP CHECK Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/s:aave.eth/proposal/0x4ead0ee7c538878f1584b20f12ee99e62fb7e08517042b9820836cd9fe7375c7) \n\n### Disclaimer\n\nThis proposal is powered by Skywards.

Holders of *tETH* earn real yield in excess of Ethereumâ€™s Proof-of-Stake (PoS) rewards through interest rate arbitrage while still being able to use *tETH* for DeFi activities. *tETH* is also foundational to supporting the implementation of Decentralized Offered Rates (DOR).\n\n# **Motivation**\n\nAssets like tETH are designed to unify fragmented interest rate markets and optimize yield generation. Users contribute ETH and receive tETH, redeemable for their initial ETH plus additional yield. This yield comes from a dynamic strategy that balances staking rewards and interest rate arbitrage on lending protocols. For tETH, this ensures baseline yields equivalent to native ETH staking while capturing additional returns from rate inefficiencies. These assets are composable across DeFi, enabling broader usability.\n\nBy onboarding tETH to Aave V3 Prime Instance, we can:\n\n- **Enhance capital efficiency**: Users can borrow against tETH, unlocking liquidity while continuing to earn restaking rewards.\n- **Increase protocol revenue**: More borrowing activity leads to higher interest income for Aave.\n- **Expand Aaveâ€™s influence in restaking finance**: Positioning Aave as a central lending hub for LRTs.\n\n# **Specification**\n\nRisk Parameters will be updated by Risk Service Providers at ARFC stage, and ARFC will be updated accordingly. \n\n## Useful links\n\nhttps://www.treehouse.finance/\n\nhttps://docs.treehouse.finance/protocol/teth/introduction\n\n# Disclaimer\n\nThis proposal is directly powered by ACI (Aave Chan Initiative).
