The deployment is supported by risk and technical service providers LlamaRisk and ChaosLabs, who acknowledge the network is in early stages but highlight promising ecosystem developments and risk parameter proposals. Historical similar proposals on interest rate automation and onboarding assets on new chains have passed with strong support and mostly positive TVL impacts.",
