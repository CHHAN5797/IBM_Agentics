        "body": "### PR with Payload\nhttps://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/683\n\n**Summary:**\nThe [ether.fi](https://www.ether.fi/) team proposes a Balancer Boosted Gauge for a weETH-rETH pool on Ethereum mainnet, with a 10% emissions cap. The goal is to move from the current weETH-WETH pool to this one over time because of the 100% yield bearing nature in the new pairing. The proposal below is based on the original proposal of [BIP-492](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-492-enable-weeth-weth-gauge-ethereum/5353).\n\n**Protocol Description:**\n\n[Ether.fi](http://ether.fi/) is a decentralized, non-custodial liquid staking protocol built on Ethereum, allowing users to stake their ETH and participate in the DeFi ecosystem without losing liquidity. The protocols eETH is a liquid restaking token (weETH is the non-rebasing equivalent), serving as a representation of ETH staked on the Beacon Chain, which rebases daily to reflect the associated staking rewards. Users can deposit ETH into the liquidity pool to mint eETH, hold eETH to accrue rewards, and use eETH within DeFi or swap it back to ETH at any time via the liquidity pool. The protocol currently employs a permissioned validator set, however this will transition to permisionless based on the protocol roadmap.\n\nETH staked through the [ether.fi ](http://ether.fi/) protocol liquidity pool accrues normal Ethereum staking rewards, and will also be natively restaked with EigenLayer. Currently when users wish to restake their LST’s they lock their tokens, which breaks composability in DeFi. Staking with eETH on [ether.fi ](http://ether.fi/) automatically natively restakes that ETH to EigenLayer and accrues normal staking rewards while allowing users to keep composability on their eETH in other DeFi protocols. No other liquid staking protocol has this capability.\n\nThe eETH contract has been live since June 2023 and has approx. 10,000 ETH held within in - this ETH was accumulated before eETH was officially launched and available for end users to hold directly. Being a liquid representation of staked Ethereum, the price of the token is aligned to the price of ETH.\n\nThrough these mechanisms, eETH acts as a conduit for individuals to engage in Ethereum’s staking & restaking process with the added liquidity, making it easier for them to enter and exit staking positions while also benefiting from boosted rewards.\n\n**Motivation:**\n\n[Ether.fi](http://ether.fi/) is looking to seed a weETH/rETH pool on balancer to serve as a primary source of liquidity for eETH. Incentivising a Balancer pool could significantly boost the liquidity of the LRT. Higher liquidity ensures that traders and investors can easily enter or exit positions, which is essential for the overall usability and attractiveness of the LRT token within the DeFi ecosystem. To ensure success, [ether.fi ](http://ether.fi/) is committed to enhancing the value of the veBAL ecosystem by promoting pool liquidity through Hidden Hand voting incentives\n\n**Specifications:**\n\n1. **Governance:** - Currently, the protocol utilises a multi signature wallet, with the signatories being doxxed [ether.fi ](http://ether.fi/) executives. This will change with the evolution of the protocol, moving to decentralized governance with a DAO and a governance token in approx. 3-6 months.\n2. **Oracles:** - The Protocol relies on an oracle for withdrawals and beacon state, however, the reliance on an oracle for beacon state is set to go away in an upcoming Ethereum upgrade. The Oracle is based on the hash consensus mechanism and run by the committee members. Initially, the [ether.fi ](http://ether.fi/) team will be the only ones to operate the Oracle nodes, however the protocol grows, it will add more external parties to join the committee. \n- The rate provder for weETH is the same contract as the token and has been reviewed by the integrations team. It was deemed SAFE [here](https://github.com/threerocks-defi/code-review/blob/main/rate-providers/WeETH.md). \n3. **Audits:** - Audit reports for the [ether.fi ](http://ether.fi/) protocol are found on the GitBook page - https://etherfi.gitbook.io/etherfi/security/audits. The audits have been carried out by reputable firms such as Certik, Zellic, Nethermind, Omniscia and Solidified to ensure the security of the protocol. An audit competition was also recently completed through Hats Finance.\n4. **Centralization vectors:** - The centralization vectors primarily relate to the Oracle until it becomes decentralized, in line with the protocol roadmap. The price (staking rewards for rebasing) and the validator management (spinning up new validators and exiting them for liquidation) are also currently centralized for the early stages of the protocol to ensure mobility. As mentioned above, the signatories currently consist of the doxxed executive team at [Ether.fi](http://ether.fi/), however this will be upgraded with the implementation of the [ether.fi ](http://ether.fi/) DAO and governance.\n5. **Market History:** eETH is a brand new Liquid restaking token, therefore there is not much in the way of market history as Balancer will serve as the first pool to support wrapped eETH.\nweETH/rETH pool on Balancer: [0x05ff47AFADa98a98982113758878F9A8B9FddA0a](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0x05ff47afada98a98982113758878f9a8b9fdda0a000000000000000000000645)\nGauge: [0xC859BF9d7B8C557bBd229565124c2C09269F3aEF](https://etherscan.io/address/0xC859BF9d7B8C557bBd229565124c2C09269F3aEF)\n6. **Value:** - The weETH/rETH pool on Balancer is intended to serve as a primary liquidity source for the token. The pairing of eETH with rETH will maintain the originally intended smooth trading experience, while yielding more rewards for the liquidity providers. \n\n**Specification**:\n\nThe Balancer Maxi LM Multisig eth:`0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd` and call the addGauge function with the following arguments:\ngauge(address): `0xC859BF9d7B8C557bBd229565124c2C09269F3aEF`\ngaugeType(string): `Ethereum`",

After over a year of development and testing, the V3 upgrade is now live on Mainnet. StakeWise V3 is the (Gnosis) Safe of ETH staking, a free public good that aims to fully democratize the staking ecosystem and greatly improve the decentralisation of staked capital. Any entity can offer trustless, non-custodial staking-as-a-service via an open marketplace that gives stakers the ability to delegate to their preferred operators/staking solutions. For more details about StakeWise V3, please refer to the [StakeWise V3 Announcement](https://stakewise.medium.com/stakewise-v3-announcement-9e4fe73abdf2).\n\nStakeWise V3 features a liquid staking token, osETH, that any staker can mint to access DeFi. osETH minting is optional and can be done on-demand, for times when a liquid staking token is needed. The liquidity and integrations for osETH are provided by StakeWise DAO, creating a ready-made liquid staking ecosystem for any operator to plug into. The osETH token has in-built slashing protection due to its overcollateralisation and accrues yield from a highly diverse set of node operators. osETH is a new token that is launching with StakeWise V3 and, consequently, there is no historical price data to refer to.\n\nThe protocol is governed by StakeWise DAO, a [community-owned](https://docs.stakewise.io/governance/stakewise-dao#tokenomics) DAO with all voting rights falling to holders of SWISE, the StakeWise governance token.\n\n## Motivation\n\nosETH will be the main LST for StakeWise moving forward and the osETH-ETH Balancer pool will be the primary liquidity venue. A gauge is necessary to help bootstrap the pool’s TVL.\n\n## Specifications\n\n**1. Governance** \nThe StakeWise DAO is [community owned](https://docs.stakewise.io/governance/stakewise-dao#tokenomics) with all voting rights falling to holders of SWISE, the StakeWise governance token. The majority of the protocol’s smart contracts are immutable (incl. osETH). Contracts that are upgradable require a successful DAO vote followed by the approval of a Vault admin/owner to ensure users of the protocol retain full control over contract upgradeability.\n\n**2. Oracles** \nStakeWise relies on an Oracle network to accurately report validator balances to the protocol smart contracts. StakeWise has 11 leading commercial operators all acting under SLAs to ensure the Network runs efficiently (more information can be found [here](https://docs-v3.stakewise.io/protocol-overview-in-depth/oracles)).\n\n**3. Audits** \nHalborn and Sigma Prime ([reports are here](https://github.com/stakewise/v3-core/tree/main/audits)), alongside a public audit competition hosted by [Hats Finance](https://twitter.com/HatsFinance/status/1712166174459347001).\n\n**4. Centralization vectors**\nNo, both the StakeWise DAO and the Oracle network are decentralised.\n\n**5. Market History**\nNone, osETH is a newly deployed token.\n[Balancer pool link](https://app.balancer.fi/#/1/pool/0xdacf5fa19b1f720111609043ac67a9818262850c000000000000000000000635)\n[Gauge link](https://etherscan.io/address/0xc592c33e51A764B94DB0702D8BAf4035eD577aED)\n\n**6. Value**\nThis new Balancer pool will be the primary source of liquidity for the token.\n\n**Note:** The owner of the Pool is set to Balancer DAO and the Yield Protocol Fee has been disabled on this pool, thus not making it eligible for Core Pool status.\n\n**Specification**:\n\nThe Balancer Maxi LM Multisig eth:`0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd` and call the addGauge function with the following arguments:\ngauge(address):`0xc592c33e51A764B94DB0702D8BAf4035eD577aED`\ngaugeType(string): `Ethereum`",

This approach ensures a user-friendly DeFi experience where participants deposit ETH into the liquidity pool, mint ezETH, accumulate rewards, and seamlessly engage in other DeFi activities. Renzo is on a trajectory toward a permissionless validator set, emphasizing composability in DeFi.\n\n**Motivation:**\n\nRenzo is seeking to establish the [ezETH/WETH 50/50 pool] on Balancer to further enrich liquidity for ezETH. This move aims to enhance the trading experience across the Ethereum ecosystem, making it more accessible for users while generating additional value to the Renzo community.\n\n**Specifications:**\n \n**Governance:**\nRenzo currently operates with a multi-signature wallet, featuring doxxed founding contributors. The protocol is planning to decentralize strategy management to ezPoints holders and transition to decentralized governance in the future.\n\n**Oracles:**\nRenzo uses ChainLink oracles to price assets (besides ETH) held in the protocol, and in the future, ChainLink will also be used to price assets withdrawn from Renzo.\n\n**Audits:**\nRenzo smart contracts have been audited by Halborn. All of Renzo’s smart contracts are open source.Audits can be found here: [https://github.com/HalbornSecurity/PublicReports/blob/master/Solidity Smart Contract Audits/Renzo_Protocol_EVM_Contracts_Smart_Contract_Security_Assessment_Report_Halborn_Final.pdf](https://github.com/HalbornSecurity/PublicReports/blob/master/Solidity%20Smart%20Contract%20Audits/Renzo_Protocol_EVM_Contracts_Smart_Contract_Security_Assessment_Report_Halborn_Final.pd)\n\n**Centralization vectors:**\nCentralization vectors currently revolve around the Oracle, validator management via Figment, upgradeability via proxy multisig contract, and front end hosting,\n\nOvertime, our goal is to migrate Renzo to utilize decentralized infrastructure.\n\n**Market History:**\nFrom 0 to 100, Renzo launched on EigenLayer Mainnet 1-month ago and has witnessed explosive growth. TVL is nearing +$90M USD, with +33k ETH restaked, and over +4,500 unique depositors.\n\nRenzo’s remarkable growth and strong community backing underscore its prominence servicing users with liquid restaking on EigenLayer. The ezETH/WETH pool on Balancer will mark its inaugural support on a DEX.\n \n \n![veBAL gauge.png](ipfs://bafkreihp6ndnucaokydajbmb5dma6skebx4wffdbcmfotxyrjzrxpf5zaa)\n    \n\n**Value:**\n\nRenzo recently closed a successful seed round in December 2023, raising $3.2 million in equity with a 1:1 Token Warrant. The post-round valuation stands at an impressive $25 million, showcasing strong support for Renzo’s innovative liquid restaking protocol.\n\nRenzo strives to be the most secure and efficient liquid restaking token across DeFi and on Ethereum L2’s. Renzo is currently focused on diversification efforts to increase the number of node operators on EigenLayer, increasing decentralization and improving security for Actively Validated Services (AVS). Renzo is also working on supporting various LSTs deposits through the platform and building partnerships/integrations across aggregators, DEXs, bridges, Oracle providers, L2s, and other DeFi projects. \n\nAbove all, Renzo is committed to building the most successful liquid restaking ecosystem on EigenLayer, delivering rewarding experiences for all restakers and holders of ezETH.\n\n- [Add Pool Gauge Info] https://etherscan.io/address/0xa8B309a75f0D64ED632d45A003c68A30e59A1D8b\n- Rate Provider Review https://github.com/balancer/code-review/pull/4/files\n- The Balancer Maxi LM Multisig eth:0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860 will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at 0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd and call the addGauge function with the following arguments:\n- gauge(address):0xa8B309a75f0D64ED632d45A003c68A30e59A1D8b\n- gaugeType(string): Ethereum\n\nAdditionally, this pool is requesting core pool status as per BIP-457",

        "body": "### PR with Payload\nhttps://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/529\n\n**Summary:**\n>Tranches has been hosting qETH liquidity on Balancer for quite some time now. Adopting the bbaWETH boosted pools until recently has been a fruitful endeavor, but the best choice now is to qETH/WETH. This pool’s liquidity will serve as a basis for qETH liquidity and minimize risk overall. This will be considered a core pool, earn Balancer-related revenues, and support the LSD hub narrative.\n\n**References/Useful links:**\n\n> Link to:\n    • Website:https://tranchess.com/ \n• Documentation: https://docs.tranchess.com/ \n• Github Page: https://github.com/tranchess\n• Communities: [Twitter](https://twitter.com/tranchess), [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/tKxAq78VBr), [Telegram](https://discord.com/invite/tKxAq78VBr)\n\n\n**Protocol Description:**\n\n> Tranchess is a structured liquid staking and asset tracking protocol initially launched on BNB Chain in June 2021. It launched its BNB liquid staking fund in January 2022 with its own validator node and remains as one of the top 21 validator nodes and leading protocol on the BNB Chain.\n\n>Tranchess’  structure comprises one main token, known as the QUEEN token, and two tranches, BISHOP and ROOK. QUEEN tracks the underlying asset’s price and earns enhanced yield with yield farming and liquid staking features. QUEEN can be split evenly into two sub-tranches, BISHOP and ROOK. BISHOP is a stablecoin-like token that earns a steady interest by lending its underlying position to ROOK while sharing some of the liquid staking earnings. ROOK is a token with a built-in leveraged position to the underlying asset on top of its liquid staking earning base without the risk of forced liquidation.\n\n>Tranchess currently runs three asset-tracking pools: BTC, ETH and BNB on the BNB Chain, and and the ETH liquid staking pool on Ethereum. qETH is the liquid-staked ETH from the Tranchess Beacon chain staking system. For the convenience of future collaboration with other Ethereum protocols, qETH is designed so that the staking rewards of staked ETH is reflected as a change in the fair value of qETH, instead of a change in the number of qETH tokens. The qETH token amount will only change if users stake/unstake additional ETH with Tranchess. The proposed pool, qETH/WETH, allows users to swap between qETH and WETH, giving users the flexibility of swapping between qETH and WETH without going through the withdrawal process. Additionally, it serves as a basis for further incentivization activities such as the HiddenHand.\n\n\n**Motivation:**\n\n> The qETH/WETH pool is the cornerstone of the Tranchess ETH liquid staking product on Ethereum. Currently, the BNB liquid staking fund of Tranchess earns a total yield between 8.3% ~ 22.8%, a combination of Tranchess staking earning of CHESS (Tranchess governance token) and PoS staking. With the ETH liquid staking fund, Tranchess aims to provide a similar enhanced yield for users on Ethereum, and the qETH/WETH pool is an essential feature to a smooth user experience.\n\n>After several iterations of veBAL gauges, this goes back to the basics and incentivizes users to participate and would help quickly build up the liquidity of the pool at the beginning stage for a smoother swapping experience. The pool would naturally grow with the protocol, and we expect to facilitate the incentivization with Hidden Hand and the Balancer bribing narrative.\n\n\n**Specifications:**\n \n1. **Governance:** Tranchess’ governance token is CHESS, which users earn by staking with the Tranchess platform. CHESS holders can vote on various governance items, such as the staking earning split between BISHOP and ROOK, the weekly CHESS emission split among different funds, and can collect a weekly rebate of the protocol fees. CHESS holders also vote through Tranchess’s snapshot on proposals that are discussed and raised on the [Tranchess Forum](https://forum.tranchess.com/). Tranchess initiated its [Tranchess Community Counsel program](https://tranchess.medium.com/tranchess-community-council-tcc-408dfb1f5332) in April 2023 on further DAO exploration.\n\n2. **Oracles:** Tranchess adopts Chainlink as the price oracle.\n\n3. **Audits:** Tranchess has done multiple audits since launching as we continuously develop and improve the protocol. The most recent audit report can be found [here ](https://github.com/peckshield/publications/blob/master/audit_reports/PeckShield-Audit-Report-TranchessV2.1-v1.0.pdf). Additionally, Tranchess runs a [bug bounty program](https://immunefi.com/bounty/tranchess/) with Immunefi.\n\n4. **Centralization vectors:** \nThe token is not upgradeable or pausable.\nThe owner has limited minting capabilities and cannot blacklist the contract.\nTranchess ETH liquid staking is a decentralized ETH liquid staking product collectively run by the Tranchess dev team and node operators.\n\n5. **Market History:** \nLink to the [coingecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/queeneth)\n \n6. **Value:** The qETH/WETH pool would be the primary source of liquidity for Tranchess ETH liquid staking fund, a first stop that all Tranchess users would visit when staking with Tranchess. The pool organically grows with Tranchess ETH liquid staking volume, contributing to the Balancer community.\n\nPlease see full Three Rocks rate provider review [here](https://github.com/threerocks-defi/code-review/blob/main/rate-providers/QueenRateProvider.md).\n\nLink to the pool: [0x40C806394d03d350420d13CD7d1DE1C806f34956](https://etherscan.io/address/0x40C806394d03d350420d13CD7d1DE1C806f34956)\n\nLink to the gauge with 2% emissions cap: [0x6A58e7C904eCF991A3183d28FC73bE90732B7a30](https://etherscan.io/address/0x6A58e7C904eCF991A3183d28FC73bE90732B7a30)\n\n**Specifications**:\n\nThe Balancer Maxi LM Multisig `eth:0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd` and call the addGauge function with the following arguments:\ngauge(address): `0x6A58e7C904eCF991A3183d28FC73bE90732B7a30`\ngaugeType(string): `Ethereum`",
