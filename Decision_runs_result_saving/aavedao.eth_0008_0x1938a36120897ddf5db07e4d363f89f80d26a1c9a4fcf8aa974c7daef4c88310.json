        "body": "## Abstract\n\nThis document presents a formal framework for dynamically calibrating the core parameters of the Correlated Asset Price Oracle (CAPO) system, namely `maxYearlyRatioGrowthPercent` and `snapshotRatio`, through autonomous Risk Oracles. These parameters jointly enforce a time-weighted upper bound on the permissible growth of a yield-bearing asset’s exchange rate relative to its base asset, thereby protecting downstream protocols from artificial inflation and oracle manipulation.\n\nRather than relying on static limits or infrequent governance actions, the CAPO system leverages real-time analytics on yield behavior, reward distribution cadence, and market deviations to continuously constrain oracle outputs. The parameter `maxYearlyRatioGrowthPercent` defines the maximum annualized compound growth allowable in the asset’s exchange rate, while `snapshotRatio`, anchored by a past reference timestamp, serves as the historical baseline against which this growth is measured.\n\nImportantly, the effectiveness of CAPO is contingent not only on defensively parameterizing `maxYearlyRatioGrowthPercent`, but also on updating `snapshotRatio` at regular intervals. Without timely snapshots, even well-bounded growth parameters can permit excessive drift between the oracle's upper bound and the asset's true economic behavior. Continuous `snapshotRatio` refreshes are therefore critical to ensuring that CAPO remains tight, responsive, and manipulation-resistant across a diverse range of yield-bearing asset types.\n\nRisk Oracles act as autonomous agents that monitor these dynamics off-chain and reparameterize the CAPO system accordingly, enabling secure, low-overhead integration into protocols that depend on yield-sensitive exchange rates.\n\n## Overview of CAPO and the Importance of Risk Oracles\n\nAs detailed in the original CAPO [framework](https://governance.aave.com/t/chaos-labs-correlated-asset-price-oracle-framework/16605), the system is architected to safeguard lending protocols against oracle-driven inflation vectors and donation-style exploits by imposing a deterministic, time-weighted upper bound on the exchange rate between a yield-bearing derivative (e.g., wstETH) and its base asset (e.g., stETH), capturing the upper envelope of organic yield accrual. This upper bound ensures that, even under adversarial conditions, such as unauthorized control of the price feed via compromised EOAs, centralized oracle dependencies, contract upgrade vulnerabilities, or donation attacks that exploit favorable exchange rate misalignments, the protocol remains protected against artificially inflated valuations that could otherwise be used to extract unbacked borrowing capacity or induce bad debt.\n\nThis enforcement is governed by three key parameters:\n\n- `snapshotRatio`: the reference exchange rate\n- `snapshotTimestamp`: time of reference\n- `maxYearlyRatioGrowthPercent`: the annualized cap on exchange rate growth\n\nThe maximum ratio is determined via:\n\n```python\n function _getMaxRatio() internal view returns (int256) {\n    return\n      int256(_snapshotRatio + _maxRatioGrowthPerSecond * (block.timestamp - _snapshotTimestamp)\n```\n\nwhere maxRatioGrowthPerSecond = (snapshotRatio * maxYearlyRatioGrowthPercent)/SECONDS_PER_YEAR, effectively transforming a multiplicative derivation into fixed point arithmetic. To enforce temporal smoothing and prevent manipulation via micro-timeframe extrapolation, as discussed [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/chaos-labs-correlated-asset-price-oracle-framework/16605#motivation-behind-minimum_snapshot_delay-5), the `snapshotRatio` ensures the snapshot is taken at a sufficient temporal offset from the current block timestamp.\n\nThe `snapshotRatio` functions as the foundational reference rate from which the upper bound on the exchange rate, denoted `maxRatio`—is derived. The parameter `maxRatioGrowthPerSecond` thus imposes a cap on the permissible rate of change in `maxRatio` relative to the time elapsed between the `snapshotTimestamp` and the current timestamp. This structure inherently positions `snapshotRatio` as the anchor for time-weighted evolution, with `maxRatioGrowthPerSecond` encoding the maximal compound growth over time.\n\nImportantly, this design implies that if `snapshotRatio` is not refreshed at a consistent cadence, the derived `maxRatio` becomes increasingly detached from real-world exchange rate dynamics. Over long intervals, the temporal averaging embedded in the model begins to dilute responsiveness, effectively introducing drift between the enforced upper bound and the actual prevailing rate.\n\nTo illustrate this phenomenon, consider an example where `maxRatioGrowthPerSecond` is set to 9.68%, as wstETH is. If the factual growth in the exchange rate over the elapsed period is only 3.1%, then as the time delta increases, the upper bound `maxRatio` diverges significantly from the true rate. As observed below, the exchange rate can grow as much as 9% before reaching the upper bound during an inflation attack, which represents an equivalent 7 day APY of 450% in order to hit the upper bound. This growing discrepancy stems from the assumption of compounding at 9.68% per second, whereas reality reflects a much more tempered rate, thus highlighting the need for timely `snapshotRatio` updates to maintain effective control and fidelity in rate enforcement.\n\n![1.png](ipfs://bafkreihcahvawqdl2lxatwjkwjyno54srkgosdfaizpiqhwd5lfhlyjala)\n\n\nAssuming the `snapshotRatio` is updated monthly with a 7-day delay, the same `maxYearlyRatioGrowthPercent` constraint results in a substantially tighter upper bound on the exchange rate trajectory and its derived annualized growth. Empirically, the realized exchange rate remains within ~0.7% of the computed maximum exchange rate at all times, demonstrating effective rate bounding. Notably, this occurs even as the implied annualized growth, computed as a function of the local exchange rate delta, ranges between 12% and 37%. This discrepancy illustrates how regular `snapshotRatio` updates act as a mechanism for bounding short-term rate expansions, minimizing artificial inflation in annualized growth metrics induced by infrequent updates or stale snapshots.\n![22.png](ipfs://bafybeihciinb7ljom7njl62ktvepcziv2elbc2uucxrcc2sta3fniee7i4)\n\n## Dynamic Responsiveness to Local Yield Spikes: Automating `maxYearlyRatioGrowthPercent`\n\nIn the general case, updating `maxYearlyRatioGrowthPercent` is a relatively frictionless and statistically grounded process. Most yield-bearing assets, such as those driven by lending interest, validator rewards, or liquidity mining, exhibit deterministic or semi-deterministic return profiles, enabling historical data to reliably inform an optimal cap value in a relatively infrequent manner. The CAPO algorithm leverages this regularity by using observed historical behavior to tune bounds that are both tight and appropriate, minimizing over-constraining during periods of normal growth. However, in assets with more sporadic or bursty yield distributions, where updates occur less frequently and `snapshotTimestamp` values may trail current conditions, large injections of rewards, such as DAO-driven emissions, retroactive drops, or sudden staking incentives, can cause abrupt local spikes. In these cases, the growth rate inferred from such snapshots can become outdated or unrepresentative, lagging behind the true yield trajectory.\n\nUnder the assumption that yield rates are experiencing local upward spikes, such that organic accrual temporarily approaches the configured `maxYearlyRatioGrowthPercent`, the CAPO algorithm, informed by its multidimensional parameter configuration, is designed to adaptively respond. It minimizes false positives by dynamically tightening or relaxing bounds in proportion to observed volatility, thereby reducing unnecessary artificial constraining during periods of legitimate growth. The parameter `maxYearlyRatioGrowthPercent` is computed as follows:\n\n![33.png](ipfs://bafkreia26dur5sa3dteurs7epfwezzkwxzgjcl3hnl337kxnr4ktv3ozsu)\n\n### **Update Decision Rule under Rate Escalation**\n\nGiven the constraint that CAPO parameters can only be updated every 3 days, it is essential to design a conservative yet precise mechanism for deciding when to trigger an update of `maxYearlyRatioGrowthPercent`. The objective is to ensure that if a sudden escalation in staking yield begins, the CAPO mechanism still maintains an enforceable cap on the exchange rate before the next available update window. To achieve this, we introduce a decision rule that relies on short-term yield velocity as a proxy for immediate risk.\n\n![99.png](ipfs://bafkreia26dur5sa3dteurs7epfwezzkwxzgjcl3hnl337kxnr4ktv3ozsu)\n\nIn contrast, under the assumption that observed rates decrease over time, per the algorithm above, the recommended output is derived as a function of the last 90 days of data, hence updating downward when necessary. In this context, the underlying “decision rule” is structured such that half of the defined maximum relative change serves as the threshold for permissible deviation, effectively acting as the trigger condition for downward rate updates.\n\n### Practical Examples and Backtesting\n\nTo illustrate the behavior and responsiveness of the rate calibration framework under varying market conditions, we present two contrasting case studies, ezETH and wstETH, analyzed through historical reward dynamics, APY trajectories, and parameter updates observed during recent backtesting.\n\nezETH’s reward distribution has historically been highly irregular, characterized by intermittent and uneven emissions. In March, ezETH’s exchange rate experienced a notable upward distortion due to the protocol’s one-time injection and distribution of EIGEN rewards directly into the ezETH contract. This distribution materially inflated the exchange rate by increasing the cumulative rewards per token, effectively front-loading yield accrual. Prior to this event, the system exhibited significant short-term volatility in reward emissions and the associated annualized APY, as reflected in elevated dispersion metrics and an initially calibrated maximum rate of 12.38%.\n\n![44.png](ipfs://bafkreifwfbo46nxkqbwqzymclmr572gihrm4qru7mzian57kp6db32elby)\nPost-spike, the rate-setting algorithm executed a parameter recalibration in response to the updated reward trajectory. The underlying statistical properties, such as recent APY momentum and rate-of-change in cumulative rewards, registered an upward shift, thereby impacting the computed max rate recommendation. Crucially, the required minimum 3-day trailing APY, used as a guardrail to prevent excessive rate increases, converged below the observed realized 3-day APY. As a result, the updated max rate, governed by the 3-day constraint, was deemed optimal and within bounds, thereby increasing the associated maxYearlyGrowthPercent. The system thus exhibited resilience by adapting to the anomalous input while maintaining rate integrity and responsiveness.\n\n![55.png](ipfs://bafkreifir5v7tpch6njsel5p5wrg565fzounfj27nisj6u4p37gavquap4)\n\n\nBy contrast, wstETH exhibits highly deterministic rate growth and a stable state trajectory, which minimizes the need for active updates. The protocol operates under a dynamically constrained cap, continuously adjusted through real-time updates to the `snapshotRatio`. Given the low volatility and predictable accrual pattern, updates to the `maxYearlyRatioGrowthPercent` have been largely unnecessary, with the current value of 4.6% remaining sufficient to accommodate its steady yield progression.\n\n![66.png](ipfs://bafkreia4hddvx5akzcugqufqdjg726mx5lkdsklnsein7lbbnuhjldjtu4)\n\n\nInternally, while the effective recommended rate evolves, the magnitude of change remains within the tolerance defined by the existing `maxYearlyRatioGrowthPercent`, thereby not triggering an update. Specifically, the required 3-day APY has consistently remained below the observed 3-day APY, ensuring that the rate adjustment constraint remains satisfied. It is only toward the later stages of the observation window that we see a decline in the recommended rate, driven by the sustained smoothing of short-term yield signals, reflected in both the capped maximum rate and a concurrent reduction in measured volatility. \n\n![77.png](ipfs://bafkreid3ykkv6cqm6dzhijctdotfmyiyfrxelmztxi6lf4lajl6wrd3ppu)\n\n\n### **Proposed Parameter Constraints for CAPO Risk Oracle Updates**\n\nTo maintain the integrity, predictability, and neutrality of the CAPO system, Risk Oracle parameter updates are subject to explicit constraints that govern their frequency and magnitude. These constraints are designed to ensure that CAPO remains a minimally trusted, credibly neutral mechanism, where bounded reactivity to market conditions does not come at the expense of system stability or over-centralized control.\n\n**`snapshotRatio` Constraint**:\n\nThe `snapshotRatio`, which serves as the historical anchor for computing the time-weighted upper bound on exchange rates, can be updated at most once every 14 days and by no more than 5% relative to the prior value. The underlying algorithm will in practice only update once a month in most settings, representing an approximate upper bound of ~60% APR over a monthly horizon, aligned with aggressive but plausible yield scenarios.\n\nImportantly, snapshotRatio is simply obtained from the relevant smart contract currently utilized to calculate the exchange rate for a given asset, at a given timestamp snapshotTimestamp, which adheres to the associated time-weighted logic expressed [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/chaos-labs-correlated-asset-price-oracle-framework/16605#motivation-behind-minimum_snapshot_delay-5) (generally 7-14 days prior).\n\n**`maxYearlyRatioGrowthPercent` Constraint**:\n\nThe parameter that controls the annualized rate ceiling can be adjusted once every 3 days, with a maximum 10% relative change per update. This strikes a balance between responsiveness to dynamic yield environments and measured, rate-limited evolution of the enforced cap.\n\n| **Parameter** | **Max Relative Change per Update** | **Timelock** |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `snapshotRatio` | 5% | 14 Days |\n| `maxYearlyRatioGrowthPercent` | 10% | 3 Days |\n\n# **Disclaimer**\n\nChaos Labs has not been compensated by any third party for publishing this ARFC.\n\n# **Copyright**\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain)",

        "body": "# Summary\nChaos Labs proposes a **12-month early renewal** of our risk management partnership with the Aave DAO, starting July 13, 2025. This renewal will be a **new and separate engagement stream**, operating **in parallel with the current engagement**, which remains active through November 12, 2025. The early renewal will **not affect the existing engagement** and will continue independently through July 12, 2026.\n\nThis proposal reflects both the expanded scope of work already delivered—including support for new asset classes, implementation of systemic risk mechanisms, and over 1,100 risk parameter updates—and Chaos Labs’ continued commitment to building critical components of Aave’s risk infrastructure.\n\nOur top priority for the upcoming term is the deployment and scaling of the Edge Risk Oracle, which currently secures over $5B in deposits and dynamically manages supply caps, borrow caps, interest rate curves, and PT parameters. Significant functional expansions are underway to further automate and strengthen the protocol’s risk systems.\n\nWe are seeking DAO alignment on this strategic direction and resource allocation to ensure the sustained delivery, scalability, and decentralization of Aave’s risk management infrastructure.\n\n## Background & Context\n\nChaos Labs was appointed by the Aave DAO in November 2022 as its dedicated risk partner and is currently operating under a 12-month engagement that began in November 2024. Since the start of this current term, Aave has experienced substantial growth—doubling its TVL from $12B to $24B and generating over $71.5M in protocol revenue. This rapid expansion has been accompanied by a surge in protocol complexity across assets, deployments, and mechanisms.\n\nOver this same period, Aave has integrated or prepared for several major system upgrades: onboarding of Principal Tokens (PTs); deployment of mechanisms such as Smart Value Recapture (SVR); and the upcoming launch of Umbrella, Aave’s insolvency protection layer.\n\nTo meet these evolving needs, Chaos Labs has transitioned from periodic risk reviews to delivering deeply integrated, protocol-native risk automation infrastructure. At the core of this system is our Edge Risk Oracle architecture, which powers automated, governance-bounded updates to supply and borrow caps, interest rate curves, and Principal Token collateral parameters—actively securing over $5B in deposits across Aave markets. In parallel, we’ve expanded our real-time monitoring infrastructure, executed over 1,100 parameter updates via the Risk Stewards, and published targeted research on high-impact risk domains such as Ethereum validator staking penalties, Ethena-related risks, and SVR recapture dynamics.\n\nAs Aave prepares to onboard 10+ additional deployments and expand its asset coverage further, the protocol’s resilience and capital efficiency will depend on the continued development of a modular, data-driven risk layer. This renewal enables Chaos Labs to maintain and scale that infrastructure in lockstep with Aave’s accelerating trajectory.\n\n## Enhanced Scope and Value Delivery Highlights\n\nDespite renewing at flat commercials of **$2M** in November, Chaos Labs has significantly expanded its work's scope, volume, and impact compared to the prior year, delivering substantially more value **without a budget increase**.\n\nOver the past six months of the current engagement, Chaos Labs has provided both tactical execution and strategic risk support, surpassing last year’s outputs across all key metrics:\n\n- **64 asset listing analyses** completed in the past 7 months (vs. 46 in the entire previous year), reflecting a sharp increase in volume and diligence scope.\n- **13 new deployment listings**, with 10 scheduled to go live shortly, significantly expanding protocol reach and impact.\n- **226 supply cap, 203 borrow cap, and 572 interest rate curve updates** executed through the Risk Stewards, scaling operational coverage.\n- **260 total forum posts** spanning proposal authorship, parameter reviews, research, and real-time risk insights, reinforcing Chaos Labs’ governance leadership.\n\n![image - 2025-06-12T210246.737.png](ipfs://bafkreiefqlamz46t2mv2g67iq3yw22knonzuttnvdyn5ivz5el6sn4cqnu)\n\nThe quality and depth of asset listings have significantly evolved, centered on the fundamental characteristics of each asset and its interaction with Aave’s core mechanisms. Listings incorporate understanding how the asset functions within its native protocol, aligning risk parameters with issuer-specific designs such as redemption logic, staking mechanics, or rebase behavior at a technical level. These are paired with simulation-backed stress testing, modeling systemic interactions, market shocks, and protocol-specific failure modes to ensure resilient integration.\n\nFor contrast:\n\n- Earlier listing: [oSETH onboarding](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-onboard-oseth-to-aave-v3-on-ethereum/16913/8?u=chaoslabs)\n- Current standard: [USR onboarding](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-add-usr-to-aave-v3-core-instance/21444/2?u=chaoslabs)\n\n### Edge Risk Oracle Infrastructure\n\nChaos Labs has not only deployed a suite of Risk Oracles across the protocol—we have also designed the quantitative methodologies, triggers, and governance guardrails that underpin them.

Building on our existing deployments, the following areas are targeted for upcoming integration:\n\n- **Expansion of Supply & Borrow Cap Oracles** to all Aave V3 instances, ensuring consistent and utilization-optimized cap management across deployments.\n- **Deployment of Interest Rate Curve Oracles** across stablecoin and high-volume collateral markets, enabling real-time dynamic pricing to optimize protocol welfare and maintain competitive market conditions.\n- **Ongoing Principal Token (PT) Risk Oracle coverage**, ensuring that all new PT listings are automatically supported with live collateral parameter adjustments, while maintaining existing integrations.\n- **Automated Kill Switch Integration** for LSTs, LRTs, Ethena-related, and other yield-bearing derivatives, disabling supply or borrow functionality under adverse events such as validator slashing, depegs, or liquidity collapse.\n- **Reserve Factor Risk Oracle**, to dynamically optimize DAO revenue through automated reserve factor tuning, aligned with Umbrella’s framework and responsive to shifting market dynamics and liquidity flows.\n\nAll updates will continue to be bound by governance-approved parameters and transparently tracked through public dashboards. This upcoming roadmap represents a significant step toward full-spectrum oracle-driven risk automation across the Aave ecosystem.\n\n### SVR & Real-Time Monitoring Infrastructure\n\nChaos Labs will continue to operate and enhance Aave’s real-time risk and monitoring infrastructure, which serves as the backbone of protocol-level visibility and operational responsiveness.\n\nWe will expand monitoring dashboards to support all future deployments, incorporating detailed liquidation performance analytics across collateral types and borrower segments. This includes real-time tracking of oracle deviations, recapture efficiency, and execution quality, enabling the DAO to evaluate the effectiveness of MEV recapture and broader liquidation outcomes.\n\nBeyond SVR, our infrastructure will maintain wallet-level exposure analysis, surfacing risks related to position concentration, correlated collateral dependencies, and liquidation clustering potential. These insights will be paired with risk alerting systems, flagging real-time anomalies such as overutilized assets, depleted liquidity, or extreme funding dislocations.\n\nWe will also continue to publish live Oracle performance logs and full update histories for all automated parameter changes, including caps, LTVs, interest rates, and more. This ensures ongoing transparency, accountability, and governance alignment across all Chaos-managed automation layers within the Aave protocol.\n\n### Aave Umbrella: Deployment, Maintenance, Monitoring & Parameterization\n\nChaos Labs is leading the risk management and parameter calibration efforts for Aave Umbrella, a native insolvency protection mechanism that introduces a tranche structure to absorb bad debt under stress scenarios. Umbrella will enhance Aave’s systemic resilience by enabling structured risk-sharing and coordinated protection across markets and deployments.\n\nDuring this engagement, we will focus on operationalizing Umbrella across active and upcoming deployments. This includes simulation-backed design of exposure caps, freeze conditions, and incentive structures tailored to the unique risk profile of each reserve.\n\nWe will provide ongoing support and insights to the Aave Finance Committee in calibrating key parameters such as:\n\n- **`maxEmissionPerYear`**, which reflects the incremental yield required to compensate users for staking into Umbrella. Its calibration will account for factors including foregone collateral utility, prevailing interest rate environments, cooldown risk, and systemic exposure.\n- **`Target Liquidity`**, representing the optimal reserve coverage needed to mitigate tail risks, derived using a quantitative Value-at-Risk (VaR) framework. This ensures efficient sizing of Umbrella participation across volatile and composable markets.\n\nTo support transparency and community alignment, we are also launching a dedicated Umbrella Dashboard, providing real-time analytics and visualizations on reserve coverage, parameterization status, and system-wide protection metrics.\n\nUmbrella will serve as a key component of Aave’s systemic risk architecture, offering structured insolvency protection and capital efficiency across an increasingly complex multi-deployment environment.\n\n### Asset Listings & Adaptive Risk Management\n\nAs Aave continues to expand across new networks, asset types, and market structures, the protocol requires a more agile, simulation-driven risk framework capable of responding to a constantly evolving landscape. Chaos Labs will continue to lead risk onboarding and configuration for new assets and deployments, adapting to novel pricing mechanisms and composable integrations as they emerge.\n\nRather than relying solely on fixed parameter templates, our approach is dynamic and context-specific. We evaluate each asset and market instance on its own terms, factoring in liquidity, volatility, composability, and systemic impact. As Aave’s complexity increases, we ensure that risk management scales accordingly, applying both proactive simulations and real-time monitoring to inform governance-aligned recommendations.\n\nAll adjustments are implemented through the Risk Steward framework, enabling timely and bounded execution. Each action is paired with transparent rationale and tradeoff analysis, ensuring the community remains informed and aligned as the protocol grows in depth and reach.\n\n### GHO Risk Management\n\nChaos Labs will continue managing GHO risk through parameter tuning, peg monitoring, and facilitator oversight. With the launch of sGHO and the Aave Savings Rate (ASR), we are developing a comprehensive quantitative model to optimize ASR parameters—AMP, Premium, and Index Rate—ensuring yields remain competitive, sustainable, and resistant to arbitrage.\n\nWe will benchmark sGHO against comparable stablecoins, monitor user behavior, and propose adjustments as needed. All insights will be surfaced via our GHO Risk Dashboard, covering peg health, ASR dynamics, and facilitator activity in real time.\n\nIn parallel, we will maintain and expand monitoring of the GHO peg across centralized and decentralized exchanges, analyzing liquidity, volume, and spread behavior under various market conditions. We will continue onboarding support for new GHO facilitators, offering simulations and stress-testing of credit allocation models, collateral design, and associated systemic risk.\n\n### Incident Response & DAO Support\n\nAs Aave’s risk partner, Chaos Labs will remain on call to respond to major market events or protocol-level disruptions. These events may include oracle failures or feed manipulation, validator slashing incidents that impact collateral values, asset-specific volatility (e.g., USDe or stETH depegs), and coordinated liquidation events during systemic stress. With the ongoing integration of the Edge Risk Oracle infrastructure, many of these scenarios can now be proactively addressed through automated parameter adjustments and killswitch logic, reducing manual intervention and minimizing the risk of cascading failures.\n\nOur incident response protocol includes rapid modeling of potential impact, simulation of mitigation paths, coordination with DAO stakeholders and Guardians, and publication of real-time risk updates with proposed governance actions. We will also produce post-incident reports that evaluate event triggers, parameter effectiveness, and potential upgrades to future protections.\n\nOur role as an embedded operational risk steward ensures that Aave can respond with speed, confidence, and clarity when it matters most.\n\n## Community Engagement & Governance\n\nChaos Labs will:\n\n- Publish monthly updates summarizing progress, simulations, Oracle activity, and dashboard enhancements, which can be observed in [this](https://governance.aave.com/t/chaos-labs-monthly-community-update/11174/27?u=chaoslabs) thread.\n- Remain active on the Aave Governance Forum with posts, feedback, and proposal authorship\n- Maintain weekly syncs with delegates and contributors\n- Share dashboards, documentation, and analysis artifacts for community insight\n\n## Early Renewal Commercial Terms\n\nTo ensure continuity and align long-term commitments, we propose executing an early renewal agreement, effective **July 13, 2025, with a 12-month term** running through July 12, 2026.\n\n**This renewal will run concurrently with the existing contract until November 12, 2025, after which it will continue as the sole active agreement through its conclusion on July 12, 2026.**\n\nThis proposal reflects both the **expanded scope of work already delivered**—including support for new asset classes, implementation of systemic risk mechanisms, and over **1,100 risk parameter updates**—and Chaos Labs’ continued commitment to building critical components of Aave’s risk infrastructure.\n\n**Early Renewal Summary:**\n\n- **Renewal Term:** July 13, 2025 – July 12, 2026\n- **Duration:** 12 Months\n- **Annual Contract Value:** $3,000,000 USD\n    - 85% - $2,550,000 USD in aEthLidoGHO\n    - 15% - $450,000 USD in AAVE\n        - AAVE price (and corresponding amount of tokens allocated to Chaos) will be determined using a 30-day time-weighted average price (TWAP) based on CoinGecko pricing at the time of Snapshot conclusion.\n- **Payment Method:** Streamed linearly via `createStream()` using `IAaveEcosystemReserveController`\n- **Recipient Address:** `0xbC540e0729B732fb14afA240aA5A047aE9ba7dF0` (Chaos Labs multisig)\n\n## Conflict Disclosures\n\nChaos Labs provides risk services to other DeFi protocols (e.g., Benqi, Gearbox, Venus).

        "body": "# Summary\n\nChaos Labs proposes the implementation of a risk oracle to set optimal interest rate curves for stablecoins within the Aave protocol. We select a *slope1* parameter that would lead to the best attainable protocol welfare, operationalized as constrained gross revenue, based on a dynamic analysis of borrowers' aggregate responses to interest rate changes and total supply fluctuations. The primary components of the oracle architecture comprise:\n\n**Demand models** - a demand model is an object that encapsulates certain assumptions about the behavior of protocol borrowers and specifies an approach to estimating the numeric parameters that pin down this behavior \n\n**Demand model estimation** - given a demand model, parameters characterizing borrower behavior can be determined using aggregate market data, with the model's accuracy evaluated out of sample \n\n**Model selection** - the oracle pipeline estimates multiple demand models and evaluates their performance on out of sample historical data, so that the best model can be selected to drive the protocol optimization model  \n\n**Protocol optimization** - using the best demand model available to predict borrower response to interest rate changes, we determine the best slope parameter to maximize protocol welfare, subject to certain guardrails\n\nThe demand and protocol welfare models underlying the oracle transform aggregate market observables directly into a slope parameter recommendation, subject to programmable constraints implementing safety guardrails. As a concrete example, the constraints ensure that deviation from current parameter is appropriately restricted and that counterfactual demand induced by the optimal slope parameter does not breach utilization limits at any time.\n\n## Model flow\n\n![image.jpg](ipfs://bafkreidrpyy5wlryn6lzggou6if5ed6g26l7o3dpmahpxge5k2ei2axfwe)\n\n## Motivation\n\nRisk management requires setting parameters in a manner that safeguards the protocol against extreme events. Existing workflows that lead to particular recommendations for changes to protocol configuration, such as the shape of the interest rate curve, are driven by this consideration. We are proposing an oracle that would supplement this workflow, taking some of the critical elements of a risk configuration as a given and optimizing the protocol for an objective distinct from “minimizing bad debt accrual during periods of extreme volatility.” Here, we still treat risk management as the primary consideration, accepting some elements of the existing protocol configuration as an explicit constraint, while attempting to achieve constrained optimal protocol welfare.\n\nThe current approach for updating interest rates, utilizing the risk steward contract, allows for a maximum adjustment to the slope1 parameter of 100 bps every three days. However, this method requires considerable operational effort, as it involves manually creating a series of transactions to modify the interest rate curve across more than 60 stablecoin markets on 16 deployments, with a process akin to the one presented in [Supply and Borrow Cap Risk Oracle Activation](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-supply-and-borrow-cap-risk-oracle-activation/20834). This process becomes especially inefficient during repricing events, where the manual overhead and fundamental constraints hamper the ability to respond dynamically to changes in demand.\n\nAs Aave is the largest DeFi lending protocol, especially in terms of aggregate stablecoin liquidity, it effectively boasts the title of the primary market when deducing the market-priced interest rate on-chain. It is therefore essential to adopt a generalized, transparent, and robust methodology grounded in aggregate demand models—mathematically simple yet capable of generating meaningful predictions about future borrower behavior to optimize its configuration accordingly. By using multiple models and selecting the best ones dynamically, we ensure that the methodology is flexible enough to capture the evolving characteristics of demand for stablecoins, taking advantage of variation in supply to estimate demand model parameters. This approach does not rely on interest rate variation or any assumptions on the origin of existing interest rate curve parameters, making it robust to feedback loops.\n\n# Data\n\nWe model the demand, or total borrowing, as aggregate demand curves, or mathematical functions relating the prevailing market interest rate to demand. The particular shape of any such curve encodes the behavior of protocol borrowers in response to changes we make to the interest rate curve parameters. Each type of demand curve is defined by some parameters, which we can estimate using aggregate market data. The aggregate market data feeding into the model estimation component tracks total borrowing, supply and other market characteristics, such as the current interest rate curve settings, for supported chains, tokens and markets at a ~10-15 minute cadence. All estimation and protocol optimization utilize the observations at each update, although our analysis will use some quantities aggregated to daily or hourly levels, for the reader's convenience.\n\n# Demand\n\n## Demand models\n\nConceptually, a demand model should be thought of as a triple consisting of a **demand function**, **estimation objective** and **loss function**. The demand function captures the aggregate change to total borrowing in response to a change in the interest rate curve. The estimation objective and loss function determine how the demand curve is fit to historical data.  \n\nThe demand functions represent downward sloping aggregate demand, with some scale parameter *A*, characterizing the overall level of demand, and a parameter *σ* characterizing the elasticity, or the relative magnitude of the demand response to a change in interest rates.\n\nOur demand functions are\n\n**isoelastic** - *Ax^σ*, the elasticity parameter fixes the price elasticity at all points along the curve\n\n**exponential** - *Ae^(-σx)*\n\n**linear** - *A + σx*, the elasticity parameter is the slope of the line\n\nEstimation objectives represent the deviation that the estimation program attempts to minimize according to some loss function\n\n**price** - deviation from observed price, given the estimated demand and implied price\n\n**demand** - deviation from observed demand\n\nFinally, the loss functions are\n\n**L1** - minimizes the sum of absolute deviations, relatively insensitive to outliers\n\n**L2** - minimizes the sum of squared residuals\n\nConsequently, we estimate a total of up to 12 different demand models for each run of the estimation and protocol welfare optimization pipeline, selecting the best one to serve as the representation of demand response for the protocol welfare optimization program.\n\n## Estimation\n\n### Model estimation strategy\n\nIn order to use a demand model for predicting counterfactual borrower response to adjustment in the interest rate curve parameters, we must recover the values of the scale and elasticity parameters from historical data. The demand model parameters for a particular function are estimated using non-linear regressions, minimizing the selected loss relative to the target determined by the objective. The particular choice of loss function determines the influence of outliers in the estimation. Minimizing loss can be thought of as finding a function in a particular class (e.g., isoelastic demand curves) that is “closest” to the observed data, with “closeness” measured by the chosen loss function. This “closest” function is identified, within its class, by the values of its parameters.\n\nWe do not compute standard errors or other explicitly statistical constructs, as we are concerned primarily with prediction rather than statistical inference. To elaborate on this further, the purpose of a typical *econometric* exercise of this nature, as might be performed by a practitioner of demand modeling in academia or economic consulting, is to determine the values of the demand function parameters in the service of making a point concerning a theoretical claim (e.g., that the demand should be either elastic, or inelastic). The predictions of a theoretical model of demand are assessed based on a fixed dataset, and subjected to a number of tests (e.g., for normality of the noise, model selection, etc.) to winnow the models down to a particular function, which is then usually estimated using a linear regression. \n\nOur approach, while taking inspiration from standard economic models of demand, tackles the problem within a simple machine learning framework. We care most about the quality of our short-term predictions of demand response, rather than falsifying the predictions of some theoretical model. Consequently, we simply estimate the characteristics of demand on some window of data, and then predict its behavior on a disjoint time window of data to assess the quality of a particular model, that is, its out of sample fit. \n\nIn both the statistical and the machine learning approaches to modeling data-generating processes, overfitting is often a major concern. In the case of statistical models, overfitting results in poor estimation of model parameters and standard errors, while in the machine learning framework, it leads to poor out-of-sample fit. However, we restrict our models to fairly rigid functional forms, making overfitting essentially impossible.\n\nThe [Appendix](https://www.notion.so/Appendix-1d057ab37ebf80ae8c50ed4816248f49?pvs=21) presents a detailed example of model definition and estimation for an isoelastic demand function with a price objective and an L2 loss function, with an explanation of how predictions are done on each prediction window.\n\n### Retrospective predictive fit\n\nThe estimating regressions are performed on a series of partially overlapping windows of data for each model, with predictions, used in model performance evaluation, made for some time frame following the estimation window. The predicted demand is then reconstructed for the entire period of interest to assess predictive fit. In the online estimation-prediction-optimization oracle workflow, we use the most recent window alone, but for subsequent analysis we will be using multiple windows.\n\n![image (1).jpg](ipfs://bafkreibzemagcw3m233i7nsdm7ur5lekak2phvsxbquu24w2o3uyqrhteq)\n\n### Evaluation\n\nThe performance of different demand models within the prediction windows is assessed using a predictive fit measure, such as R^2, MASE (Mean Absolute Scaled Deviation) or a normalized sum of residuals. The latter measure most closely tracks “visual” fit, particularly in time-aggregated series, but is insensitive to variance. The best performing model is selected to serve as the basis for the protocol welfare optimization program.\n\n## Demand model selection\n\nAny individual model cannot be relied upon to serve as the basis for protocol welfare optimization in all timeframes. This is because, ultimately, aggregate demand is an abstraction over individual behavior of many different participants in the protocol, each with unique risk preferences, token holdings and outside options for deployment of liquidity. Over time, all of these participant characteristics evolve. Additionally, some participants may enter and exit the protocol over time. This implies that having a fixed demand function representing aggregate demand across time is unlikely to correctly reflect the aggregate behavior of the participants. We operationalize the notion of “correctness” by retrospective predictive fit, that is, the degree to which out of sample prediction matches the actually observed behavior in the past.\n\nSelecting a model on each of our moving prediction windows dynamically, we can significantly improve upon the performance of any given model. In fact, given the simplicity of our estimation approach, the predictive fit of the best-in-each-prediction-window model is surprisingly good. In the chart below, tracing demand and predicted demand from September 2024 to February 2025 for Aave’s Ethereum-core market, every window’s predicted demand is derived from the best-performing (according to the normalized sum of residuals measure) model for that window. Each window has an estimation timeframe of 7 days and a prediction timeframe of 3 days. \n\n![image (2).jpg](ipfs://bafybeie2kl6g6kyodyqne7hqst2xayhcjv5vexr3jtahdizn6tozmcyoma)\n\n# Protocol welfare model\n\n## Utilization-constrained protocol revenue as protocol welfare\n\nThere are several principles that guide our selection of aggregate protocol revenue as a measure of protocol welfare\n\n- Every user with a healthy position is necessarily a supplier in an over-collateralized protocol\n- Given the inherently risky nature of crypto markets, we can assume that the participants are, at least, risk-neutral\n- User preference is always to make more money from the participation protocol for any fixed quantity of tokens supplied\n\nNevertheless, because crypto markets are punctuated by short periods of extreme volatility and severe price corrections, we have to explicitly guard against supply depletion to preclude even transient insolvencies from damaging public perceptions of the protocol's security.\n\nFollowing the principles and the considerations above, we define platform welfare as *utilization-constrained aggregate supplier revenue*. In formal terms, we will treat aggregate protocol revenue as the objective of an optimization program, while measures of maximal allowable utilization derived from analyses focused on extreme events are taken as a constraint on the counterfactual demand at the constrained optimal *slope1*.\n\n## Protocol optimization program\n\nEffectively optimizing protocol welfare requires that the demand response to changes in the interest rate curve closely reflect the characteristics of underlying demand. Otherwise, the optimal interest rate curve parameter settings are optimal in name only, since the response of the borrowers to parameter changes cannot be effectively predicted.\n\nWe will assume that supply is a fixed quantity at every observation time. In principle, the supply side (which is, as we point out above, *also the demand side*) should be responsive to the prices we set. While it is possible, in principle, to formulate a more complex problem that considers both demand and supply response, we only consider the former, for tractability. Below, we present a minimal example of a protocol optimization program.\n\nLet us introduce some symbolic quantities\n\n![image 3.png](ipfs://bafybeibc6gef3dbffadk5iodbnymhu7zu4ghgpr2xh7jumask5j26mfv44)\n\nWe can now formulate a candidate optimization program for protocol welfare, normalizing both supply and demand by the total supply for illustration, so that we do not need to consider utilization separately from demand\n\n![image 4.png](ipfs://bafkreifa2egvpi6ofkp7tyzmt4lzy6jv5543odex3sxfyfqxwgqhafuxbe)\n\nThe program aims to maximize revenue from interest accrual, subject to a realized utilization constraint, which requires that the demand response not result in utilization above some threshold for every single datapoint. This is an example of an essential guardrail, which ensures that the optimal solution respects a safeguard that we do not directly encode into the protocol objective.\n\n## Protocol optimization analysis\n\nWe perform the optimization of the *slope1* parameter with responsive demand, using our prior demand model parameter estimates for this purpose, recomputing the counterfactual demand at each step in the optimization. To help us understand the operation and output of the protocol optimization model, we will examine the evolution of interest rate curves and the impact of relaxing the realized utilization constraint.\n\nWe illustrate the retrospective operation of our protocol optimization model using 2 months of data for USDC and USDT stablecoins within the Ethereum-core market for Aave V3. The timeframe ranges from 2024-12-24 to 2025-02-23. We let the slope parameter range over [0.01, 0.3], however, we impose a realized utilization constraint that guarantees that at no observation time does the counterfactual utilization demand at the optimum exceed a given threshold. As before, the estimation window size is 7 days and the prediction window size is 3 days. We restrict the model set to the 4 isoelastic demand function models for illustration, as other models can lead to greater variability in optimal slope values on this dataset.\n\n### Counterfactual Interest Rate Curve Parameters Evolution\n\nThe final output of a successful simulation model run is a new *slope1* parameter, effectively defining a new interest rate curve as a function of utilization, which then evolves over time as the estimation and prediction windows move forward, as seen below for a realized utilization constraint of 91.5%, just slightly below the kink.\n\nOver the timeframe under consideration, the total supply of both USDC and USDT is rising, but the demand is declining, leading to declining protocol revenues and low utilization.\n\n![image 5.jpg](ipfs://bafybeifgjxvcrfraljr7cu2xokof2fzczynbctnvw4mekemymkfulfietu)\n\nThe historical response to this was a gradual lowering of interest rates by decreasing the *slope1* parameter, however, utilization continued to decline. Our protocol optimization model would have led to more aggressive downward adjustment. \n\n![image 6.jpg](ipfs://bafkreien4lxxer67eapinl2fzyeatypycdsmsgryd6awjrjtprnrnoq2oe)\n\nGiven our demand model estimates, this would have kept utilization close to the specified realized utilization constraint and much higher than what was achieved by the historical policy.\n\n![image 7.jpg](ipfs://bafybeiaeltubmjypl6r5hejoddh2gzjfyw7idvy3oc2rfg2v4ziud3vfbi)\n\nHigher utilization would have offset the lower interest rates, leading to greater revenue for the protocol.\n\n![image 8.jpg](ipfs://bafybeigovmbchdnucrhljra66lbsi4vhexpycifbi7k5aqun3vhecnbx2u)\n\n# Model operation and community feedback\n\nOur approach relies on a necessarily reductive economic model of aggregate demand, which cannot incorporate all of the dynamic factors that influence real DeFi markets. The design, and specifically its underlying tooling, is a plug-and-play framework for benchmarking different protocol objectives, demand models and constraints, such as interest rate curve restrictions imposed by utilization incentive programs. This lets us leverage existing community expertise to iterate towards a better simulation model and maximal protocol welfare.\n\n## Triggers & limits\n\nThe proposed interest rate oracle leverages Edge Infrastructure to automate interest rate adjustments within set guardrails. Our methodology relies on accurate demand models to produce meaningful parameter recommendations. This means that indicators of demand behavior deviating from the last model used for protocol optimization should trigger a simulation run to refresh the demand models and produce a new parameter recommendation. A measure of deviation in observed demand can be given as\n\n![11.png](ipfs://bafkreic7ijnqkg522szkquy5sgdwugbivxhxfb6iwraq7ukrrwmbmttpsi)\n\nAdditional triggers include breaches of specific guardrails, as well as time-triggers for regular updates.\n\n- Excessive total borrowing deviation trigger\n    - Deviation from total borrowing implies that the underlying demand model requires a refresh\n    - Allows short-term average deviation to be greater than long-term average deviations, as the latter is a stronger indicator of the demand model going stale\n        - Short-term, 10 minutes to 1 hour (highest allowed aggregate deviation)\n        - Medium-term, 1 hour to 24 hours\n        - Long-term, 24 hours to 1 month (lowest allowed aggregate deviation)\n- Utilization exceeding thresholds trigger\n    - Excessive utilization breaches a constraint we explicitly impose on the model\n    - Excessive utilization measures are operationalized as an aggregate function of time and distances from the threshold, evaluated over a defined interval\n- Manual triggers\n    - Scheduled background back-testing and stress-testing simulations raise alerts to notify the risk management team of potentially advantageous updates even in the absence of significant deviations\n    - Observed utilization approaching the realized utilization threshold, an explicit model constraint, raises an alert to notify the risk management team of the need to review demand and interest rate behavior\n\nThe updates, similarly to those for the supply and borrow cap oracle, are limited in frequency and magnitude. Initially, frequency of regular updates and magnitude limits shall be set to 72 hours and 50 basis points respectively.\n\n# Appendix\n\n## Isoelastic demand with a price objective and an L2 loss function\n\n### Variables\n\n![image 9.png](ipfs://bafkreib6gev6nqoxvkbk2rk234enaxcabw3bviicqs4zwxj2reg7yfu7oa)\n\n### Functional form\n\nAssume that demand in each period has a [constant price elasticity](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/2ybrzctusv), or isoelastic, form\n\n![image|695x76](upload://wapFGM17GcAApqVXvkzIyc6AoTL.png)\n\nThe elasticity parameter *σ* determines the % change in demand given a % change in price, at all prices along the curve. The scaling parameter *A* is the level of fully inelastic demand. The observable quantities, supply and demand, are interpreted to be USD. Price is assumed to be periodic interest rate as a decimal. Note that the choice of price scaling (e.g., periodic rate, APR, or $ cost to borrow a $1) is consequential to elasticity estimates, unless it is multiplicative. \n\nGiven the assumption of constant price elasticity for the demand, it follows that, in each period, demand, supply and price must satisfy the following equation\n\n![image|709x77](upload://sGFPTpz3HzxybilevIQs298Ejhl.png)\n\nThe price mapping is assumed to be continuous and monotonically increasing in utilization *ut = Dt / St*, though in the particular markets belonging to the Aave platform that we will be dealing with, they take a specific piece-wise linear form\n\n![image|701x121](upload://zJpUzpP1cXOvpn5aG3zdxeO7cEN.png)\n\n### Estimation of demand parameters\n\nWe take a simple machine learning style approach to determining the demand function parameters, numerically solving the following optimization program\n\n![image|708x93](upload://2VVpxkwn11Lu94cBDxZKLL9YqZH.png)\n\nThe solution minimizes the Euclidean distance between demand implied by the constant elasticity form and observed demand vectors, or the “sum of squared residuals,” as it is usually known in econometrics.\n\nAlternatively, the optimization program could be reformulated to minimize distance to the observed price vector\n\n![image|703x111](upload://xMMNqProG21qHv8pKcYyb5VglDb.png)\n\nThese optimization programs should be equivalent under our assumptions. That is, if we were to observe some data generating process arising from random variation of a flat supply curve, generating the observables *(D, P)t*, the solutions to the programs would be the same. However, in practice we do not observe such a process. We also encounter issues with numerical optimization algorithms, making the choice of a particular formulation consequential and encouraging the use of multiple models in practice.\n\n### Prediction of future demand\n\nBecause of the mechanical linkage between utilization and interest rate, observed demand and prices are positively correlated. However, we are estimating the parameters of a demand curve that is expected to be downward sloping (i.e., “holding everything else equal,” demand should decrease as prices increase).\n\nTaking into account the linkage through the interest rate curve, in each time period we can predict future demand by numerically solving the following equation \n\n![image|703x66](upload://n07pmZr3vftzQtrSBzVq3ewxodt.png)",

The scope of contribution will span the following areas of the DAO’s finances:\n\n* Treasury Management;\n* Strategic Assets’ Liquidity; and\n* Safety Module.\n\nThe combined karpatkey and TokenLogic team presents an unparalleled offering of specialized skills and proven technical expertise, with a network that spans most of DeFi.\n\n# Motivation\n\n## Treasury Management\n\nAave is the leading cross-chain lending protocol by all relevant KPIs i.e. TVL, supplied; and borrowed assets. With the latest version (v3) present on 10 networks, Aave Protocol currently generates revenue across ten networks and 18 deployments (v1, v2 incl. Centrifuge and ARC, v3 incl. Spark), consolidating a cross-chain treasury that’s currently worth around $130M.\n\n![|576x335](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/63TVEW32fnDI7_Dg3E5Mzw1XnQJd8284sa4VJ_XfrFWfVLsiEH4lX134c-X5StL4qo7L5QZOQaId-a8MQURHy2Ml3eeDfuSe8DdXRwDF-wK9cMJm26NLZjw9Ys6PZRYCT3YeUl7m49HJo_5C_tt9NeI \"Chart\")\n\nIn spite of having a significantly sized treasury, the Aave DAO faces mainly three challenges with its current treasury composition and operational practice.\n\n### Portfolio Volatility\n\nA significant portion of the treasury is held in the DAO’s native token (AAVE) which currently has limited DeFi utility and introduces volatility in the overall treasury value. The following chart illustrates the treasury allocation across various crypto assets.\n\n![|522x304](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/MAvZlV6jGMF6UfYcfO54H761nqHULxFYABWN0b-et8UjKGF1T9ZhzphJZqwlT6r8RcvQ2q9ovKLmLddvKRSiwwUhsAtlFoYpJCimdbzf6bUI0JkRsxkfed0HGSfwvh646x_mVaJlLVIA1Lc9ZltgwKA \"Chart\")\n\n### Asset Dispersion\n\nTreasury funds are dispersed around multiple collector contracts deployed in different blockchains. These funds are a direct result of how the protocol captures value and are mostly denominated in aTokens (~61) according to market activity, which requires constant rebalancing to meet expense requirements. This activity has historically been carried out through the governance processes, lacking comprehensive and up-to-date data on portfolio composition and rationale for asset allocation.![|688x384](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/TOGbL74wUrt6nMH83_jLP5kdJMQqX0Bnm4F0Qy3b605oaEz6z0xO1A3qw8ysj1hZdjzqm8MlSLP8hlesdTy3CegW3JEErznwfRdUX1YzgJS2ni8Cdb0btuuJE35VvcQi1KJVMB-Z3w7bVaSGVtlvn7U)\n\nThe DAO has only recently gained the ability to move funds between Polygon and Ethereum, while all other Treasuries are isolated, often leading to missed opportunities for leveraging the DAO’s funds. These opportunities are crucial for enhancing and capitalizing on synergies within the Aave ecosystem, including GHO management and the Safety Module.\n\n### Runway\n\nAccording to the latest [forecasted expenses](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-aave-funding-update/), the DAO’s 12-month budget is over $19M.\n\n|Category|Budget $k|Duration (mths)|Annualized Budget|\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|Security¹|$1,500|6|$3,000|\n|[Risk Management](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-aave-funding-update/15194/8)|$1,600|12|$1,600|\n|Bug Bounty|$1,000|12|$1,000|\n|Gov.

Certora only.\n2. AGD figures based on discussions with the team.\n\nWhile there are ongoing plans to secure part of this amount of stablecoins, most of it is allocated in high utilization Aave lending markets. Although reckoning the strategic rationale, holding most of the assets in the DAO’s own protocol exposes the portfolio to excessive risk in a volatility event scenario e.g. exploit.\n\n![|669x363](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/Aq6xqeeq_hr2ObgV9PFBiQrn6BFRk718dJywySHO4U7jRyUXSsMDyl7CdMhdf1cGOht1143KdBZy4mEagWkrum9CBeapl2HnDnSFfRbFNaPB4-3pZH0veEu8nMoo2cAw3-uohJYNq8s8zKUn-J45spg \"Chart\")\n\nWith the aim to support the protocol’s self-sustainability, treasury management should aim to reduce long tail asset exposure, ensure a 12-month financial runway and a stablecoins allocation that balances servicing Aave users and the DAO’s capital preservation.\n\n## GHO Development\n\nAave developed [GHO](https://docs.gho.xyz/concepts/overview) as a stablecoin native to the ecosystem and controlled by Aave Governance that enables a new level of transparency and censorship resistance. Technically, [GHO](https://etherscan.io/address/0x40d16fc0246ad3160ccc09b8d0d3a2cd28ae6c2f#readContract) is a collateral-backed stablecoin minted by users who lock up collateral assets in Aave's v3 protocol. The protocol uses smart contracts to manage the issuance and burning of the token through allow-listed entities called [Facilitators](https://docs.gho.xyz/concepts/how-gho-works/gho-facilitators), whose capacity to mint GHO (bucket) is enabled by Aave’s governance.\n\nAiming to enable committed AAVE token holders to capture additional value, GHO’s [debt strategy](https://etherscan.io/address/0x4C38Ec4D1D2068540DfC11DFa4de41F733DDF812#readContract) introduces an innovative concept of [rate discount](https://etherscan.io/address/0x4C38Ec4D1D2068540DfC11DFa4de41F733DDF812#readContract) by staking AAVE.\n\nWith an [on-chain vote executed in July](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/aave/proposal/268?chart=0), Aave launched GHO with two Facilitators (Aave itself and GHO FlashMinter), a borrowing rate of 1.5%, and a discount rate of 30% for AAVE stakers. Since then, the borrowing rate has been [increased to 4.72%](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0x9789e054e29f63da5713368be2dd0b4006f4564ef5e48c9d5e994ec20e932e35).\n\n![|690x391](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/7UXzX05dWaMixQmE4B-lkjHuv4-fu2jIFs8bn03_gLYG8hjpIm2mPHK4uhWVcyetMgZPUlWekoavWr1pfc43F15YuXkIZPy1r1K71mtU6WxdBl4rdzw4zMiABAUsHgRDP4d-BdkW_E-EcFgA1qArif0)\n\n![|691x345](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/qdTC5Jy9o8-ciz62oGpAZDGq2KOMK7V2h1S8PL-G6oawfXSJMz02eQSaeIofbcvmatQBOGogKZSyVDeLZCHpbSLDRsiCATHipR5EGO0lzc4jwoaiB3VpInOtUgiypK9UTy6mIflJpvlS6yaAmcn4pHE)\n\nAs demonstrated by GHO’s price chart, the most immediate challenge the Aave community is facing is the persistent trading of GHO at a discount practically since deployment. This trend has been influenced by higher stablecoin-enabled market rates like MakerDAO's Dai Savings Rate (DSR), creating a rate arbitrage opportunity. This cycle of borrowing and selling GHO harms GHO holders as it generates selling pressure, leading to a loss of value and eroding trust in GHO's stability. It also encourages a speculative pattern among GHO minters motivated to borrow and dump the asset, followed by repurchasing at a lower price, further driving down its value.\n\nFor the long-term health and success of GHO, two more enduring aspects require the community’s attention:\n\n### Peg Mechanisms\n\nThere's a crucial need for robust peg mechanisms tailored specifically for GHO that go beyond tactical borrow rate adjustments. Such mechanisms should be designed to help maintain GHO's value relative to its peg, irrespective of broader market movements or temporary arbitrage opportunities. Effective peg maintenance strategies will provide the dual benefits of protecting GHO's value in turbulent market conditions and reinforcing its utility as a stable and reliable medium of exchange within the DeFi ecosystem, thus addressing the core issue of price stability head-on.\n\n### Demand\n\nThe second one is generating organic demand that leads to an increased supply, mainly demand vectors external to the platform, but also including growth rooted in value-generating activities within the DeFi ecosystem. Without these value-generating flows, GHO faces the risk of remaining underutilized, hampering both its adoption and functionality as a stablecoin meant to facilitate economic activity.\n\n![|654x345](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/0K9JhuF5N6ScUkxYuGisZNp4S0IQ0qfc1ZvnW59aTIzisXhXB-4w5PX_2pzyTKs9sOlZkPikzm2IPx-uC_B366JsFOyHrmVqFYdLfmef0fBEaXquwkH-f48RAzVfmM9AqARhdcJ_EIQn7IrxaMv2fU0)\n\nCurrently, external demand for GHO has predominantly centered around its exchange for USD tokens and liquidity provision. While providing liquidity has been the sole avenue for yield generation, there has been a noticeable decrease in the allocated GHO liquidity recently.\n\n## Safety Module\n\nThe Aave Safety Module (SM) provides the DAO with an insurance-like fund expected to repay users of lost funds resulting from Aave’s smart contract exposure. The current composition of the insurance fund is overweight AAVE to the point where there exists a negative feedback loop between potential Bad Debt exposure and the AAVE token price.\n\n![|657x294](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/Haaciw-Es4QZS2QZBueQ1g1ar-L_e_Lp6MRd1neEqlzndAy5gha5PLUtYYo1QKy_k80ZGSP-cEGf-rVYbRrqZ3L0W_m6kcN3EZBcW2ciXFr5FZnQR-jPlKBHKgzQ20dOmlAVksGqlflbCk-At3Uq4d4)\n\nIf a Short Fall event was to occur, speculators could frontrun the AAVE auction, potentially even trigger liquidations on Aave Protocol, and cause the auction to occur at a lower than otherwise AAVE price. This unintentional feedback loop can be partially mitigated by modifying the safety module fund with the introduction of additional assets over time.\n\nFurthermore, the previously outlined negative feedback loop involving AAVE's price, liquidations, and bad debt results in a high cost for utilizing AAVE tokens. Consequently, it is necessary to reevaluate the incentivization of liquidity in the Safety Module, aiming for a more efficient allocation of DAO funds.\n\n![|693x410](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/675CMMvT7wcInW2NSWdJ11ByiOKa-aC627ziLQQ_WSVR_nRljGEgKdaxRZbS5RRiAQ5MSVuYC-_Vu2_5fSiWBLtmxBuENsf2GJnBVqkOnTdgH4BabaF680wEQkHSWK2OxkO87lQs9ncUOhb8yQEcyPk)\n\nThe daily cost of sustaining the SM is estimated to be approximately 100k USD per day at the prevailing AAVE distribution rate and market price. If all the AAVE and B-80AAVE-20wETH can be auctioned off at spot prices, the insurance funds coverage ranges from 1.7% to 3.2% of TVL over the last 18 months. For each $1 of coverage provided, the Aave DAO is paying approximately 31 cents each year. With a reduction in AAVE rewards, as proposed [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-treasury-management-amend-safety-module-aave-emissions/14936), the costs of sustaining the insurance fund will be reduced.\n\n## Why Partnering?\n\nAll of the topics mentioned above are deeply connected. Most of the assets contained in the treasury derive their value partly from their liquidity and the protocol’s security; the Safety Module’s effectiveness relies on attracting external capital through LP incentives; and GHO’s peg mechanism is dependant on liquidity, which could be incentivized using the treasury’s holdings.\n\nThere hasn’t been a holistic approach to these core activities of Aave DAO’s financials so far, which ultimately has led to [uncoordinated](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-enhancing-aave-daos-liquidity-incentive-strategy-on-balancer/15061/11?u=karpatkey) and inefficient decision-making processes.\n\nTokenLogic and karpatkey are partnering to provide Aave DAO with a comprehensive financial service solution. This partnership leverages:\n\n* Over three years of experience in advancing the Aave Protocol through a pivotal role in feature development and product adoption; and\n* A distinguished history of contributing to the most respected DAOs in the industry through specialized financial services.\n\nThe combined expertise of our teams is deeply rooted in the Aave ecosystem and extends across its community.\n\n### TokenLogic\n\nWe are a proactive team that puts our partners' needs first. Our developers are already actively contributing to the Aave Protocol, 23 AIPs to date. We believe in Aave’s incremental improvement process and building solutions that enable the DAO to manage its finances efficiently whilst minimizing external dependencies.\n\nOur dedication was demonstrated when we presented a proposal to improve the Aave DAO’s runway and built a preliminary frontend for the community. Our analysis will continue to showcase the interactive and transparent theme of the GHO Analytics platform. The refined scope primarily focuses on Treasury Management, GHO Liquidity/adoption and the Safety Module.\n\n### karpatkey\n\nkarpatkey is a DeFi-native organization specializing in professional DAO finance through industry-leading research and tooling since 2020. We’ve been working with [GnosisDAO](https://forum.gnosis.io/t/karpatkeys-weekly-report-on-gnosisdao-farms/6219), [Balancer](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/karpatkey-s-weekly-report-on-balancerdao-farms/4386), [ENS](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/endowment-weekly-reports/16665), [CoW Protocol](https://forum.cow.fi/t/cow-treasury-report-for-march-2023/1624https://forum.cow.fi/t/cow-treasury-report-for-march-2023/1624), and [Lido](https://snapshot.org/#/lido-snapshot.eth/proposal/0xac31f800288c68e32d1eb3cea7a525022faae3eb3bf805d1b3d248cda5375a13) on financial planning, operations, and strategy, diversifying their treasuries into sustainable portfolios of DeFi investments designed to support DAOs in executing their missions. Check out our [values](https://www.karpatkey.com/contents/karpatkey-values) to understand a bit more about our guiding and decision-making principles.\n\nAs DAO treasury developers, we contributed to some of the most reputable DeFi protocols in our industry. We supported the adoption of xDAI across Gnosis Chain, [paving the way](https://x.com/GnosisDAO/status/1673343419232526340) for the deployment of sDAI that [boosted chain TVL](https://x.com/DLNewsInfo/status/1714990022598787118) and consolidated a stablecoin hub with the integrations like Angle and Spark. Our extensive experience provided us with advanced practical knowledge on DeFi primitives like stableswap and concentrated liquidity AMMs, liquidity, and voting incentives, veTokenomics, leverage and lending platforms, and integrations with top protocols.\n\nIn addition to being an active [Aave delegate](https://governance.aave.com/t/karpatkey-delegate-platform/14417) with more than 90 governance votes since August 7th, we’ve contributed to the [development of an Aave fork](https://forum.gnosis.io/t/karpatkey-2022-year-in-review-for-gnosis/6431#lending-protocols-5) project and historically deployed, borrowed, and staked a combined $26.51M worth of LP positions in both Aave V2 and V3.\n\nWe now believe we can meaningfully contribute to solidifying Aave’s position as the leading DeFi lending protocol, not only through domain expertise but mostly through pushing positive-sum initiatives with the DAOs we work with.\n\n# Specification\n\nThis proposal outlines a collaborative framework between TokenLogic and karpatkey to manage the Aave DAO's treasury. Both parties will work in unison to ensure any future proposals within the agreed scope are jointly developed and endorsed.\n\n## Architecture for Asset Management Tooling\n\nWe aim to define and implement a robust architecture for asset management. At a high level, this architecture will enable non-custodial asset management, incorporating role-based access controls preapproved by the community that will enable treasury diversification and yield optimization. This system will ensure the Aave DAO retains full control over fund retrieval and permission management, facilitated through Aave’s \"shortExecutor\". All designs will be aligned with Aave best practices, and will encompass required steps to update existing infrastructure (e.g. SAM).\n\nAs the architecture for treasury management is being developed, the TokenLogic and karpatkey partnership will diligently progress with the necessary treasury operations, aligning them with the needs of the DAO and the stipulations of this proposal. All activities will be conducted in accordance with the established AIP model to avoid any disruptions.\n\n## Financial Security\n\nA key objective is to secure sufficient funds to ensure a one-year runway, aligning with the DAO's known budget and anticipated expenses as shared above. This approach guarantees financial stability and an operational continuity for Aave DAO.\n\nKey components of this objective will include:\n\n* Bridging Aave funds from other blockchains to consolidate them in Ethereum;\n* Migrating primary stablecoin funds from Aave v2 to Aave v3 for improved experience in using aTokens as payments; and\n* Swapping secondary stablecoins in mainnet prioritizing GHO.\n\nDo note, Financial statements have been omitted in order to present a cost conscious, high-impact solution within the current budget. If the Aave DAO wishes to explore having financial statements as part of a broader proposal, we can later expand the funding to include the additional scope.\n\nAs it currently stands, all necessary preparation for incorporating financial statements as part of the earlier TokenLogic proposal has been paused due to overall Aave budget considerations.\n\n## Formation of the Aave Liquidity Committee\n\nThis expanded committee will oversee the management of liquidity incentives and Aave-owned liquidity in alignment with Aave’s strategic asset goals. One of the main focus areas will be supporting GHO’s token price recovery. Key initiatives include:\n\n* Foster concentrated liquidity profiles that support GHO's price movement towards re-pegging, while maintaining its utility across a full range AMMs.\n  * Utilize Maverick's design to automate liquidity concentration as prices evolve, while reducing the friction caused by liquidity fragmentation in concentrated boosted pools.\n  * Optimize incentives on Uniswap v3 for concentrated liquidity, tailored across three categories: fees, GHO, and other USD token liquidity. Prioritize USD liquidity, particularly when GHO is off-peg.\n  * Continuously review and adjust incentives on platforms that yield the best results.\n  * Initial focus is on skewed liquidity distribution to support regaining the peg. However, it is paramount to ensure existing liquidity providers find sufficient utility on their GHO funds (through sustainable strategies that make use of Aave's AURA holding) to mitigate selling pressure.\n* Post-Repeg Strategy for GHO, explore sustainable approaches that preserve the token's value and expand its functional role within the ecosystem:\n  * Implement optimized liquidity strategies through Maverick and Merkl to achieve balanced liquidity and deeper market depth.\n  * Enhance GHO's extrinsic demand by incentivizing stableswap pools, such as Balancer's GHO pools, leveraging Aave’s capacity for a significant TVL increase.\n  * Work with Gyroscope to deploy liquidity pools that align with Balancer's architecture, using their advanced bonding curve model for concentrated liquidity AMMs. This strategic integration will use Aave-owned AURA to enhance GHO's price stability.\n  * Deploy and incentivize markets beyond USD-pegged assets, including ETH, ETH LSTs, EUR, and Real World Assets (RWAs). This diversification will open up new investment avenues and attract liquidity providers with varying risk appetites.\n  * Collaborate closely with Aave and specialized risk service providers to support the deployment and configuration of the GHO Stability Module (GSM). This coordination will focus on fine-tuning critical parameters, taking into account prevailing market conditions. Our objective is to integrate the GSM with managed capacity, potentially even before GHO achieves full re-pegging, as a strategic mechanism to foster price stability.\n* To optimize the utilization of surplus votes resulting from incentivized liquidity, we propose to leverage excess voting power effectively, transforming it in",

The protocol's TVL and net profit growth have largely outpaced market conditions thanks to the coordinated efforts of service providers appointed by DAO governance.\nThe Aave protocol is also the clear leader on every network Aave has deployed to, and when given a choice, DeFi users leverage Aave over alternatives.\nThis has allowed the Aave DAO not only to \"cover its own bills\" but also has built [a large treasury of ETH and stablecoins](https://aave.tokenlogic.xyz/treasury).\n\n \n![treasury.jpeg](ipfs://bafkreihrskqratcejxrmldlzopv4lj42esks3cgel2kugnd3ijzlt4leui)\n    \n\nAdditionally, during the past couple of quarters, the DAO explored revenue sharing with the Merit program, which is essentially a redistribution of the protocol's net stablecoin excess revenue to the GHO minters and stakers to support aligned behaviors and the growth of GHO. Alongside Merit, the Ahab program, which is funded by protocol net ETH & ETH-correlated assets, is mobilized to attract strategic liquidity in Aave markets, supporting protocol growth in the main & new markets.\n\nWith the ACI, we consider the DAO now ready to explore a further step in the protocol's maturity and would like to submit for governance consideration a clear path for protocol net excess revenue redistribution to the key actors of the Aave ecosystem, creating new positive dynamics and novel synergies within the industry.\n\nThis journey is designed in several incremental steps. This proposal seeks feedback on the journey as a whole as a “TEMP CHECK” and approval to begin the first step via a potential “ARFC”.\n\nTo ensure the DAO's long-term sustainability, new steps will be escalated when the protocol reaches specific growth and net excess revenue milestones.\n\n## Umbrella: A Proposed Safety Module Paradigm Shift\n\nThe Safety Module is a crucial line of defense for the Aave protocol. In case of a shortfall event, and if liquidators do not complete their tasks, the Safety Module is designed to assume the excess debt on behalf of users to avoid or at least mitigate bad debt events.\n\nFortunately, the Safety Module has never been needed for the Aave protocol. The few excess debt events in Aave protocol history have been addressed by governance through the mobilization of \"cash\" DAO treasury funds.\n\nHowever, the current model is inefficient as it relies on secondary liquidity to liquidate Safety Module assets to obtain excess debt assets and clear debt.\n\nWith both GHO and StkAAVE, the primary issue with the Safety Module is that the current $424M hosted in the Safety Module cannot effectively clear $424M of excess debt. This is because:\n\n1. The value of AAVE would be negatively impacted due to slippage.\n2. The GHO peg is unlikely to withstand the mobilization of almost two-thirds of its current supply.\n\nWhile it is highly improbable to encounter an excess debt event of this magnitude (precedent was less than 1% of this amount), the entire model has room for optimization.\n\nTherefore, Umbrella proposes:\n\n1. Segregation of coverage\n2. Elimination of reliance on secondary liquidity\n\nFrom now on, the Safety Module activation should focus on slippage-free debt burn coverage.\n\nUmbrella allows the deployment of aTokens Safety Modules that are more cost efficient and provides better protection to Aave users; This proposal seeks approval on a multi-step journey toward Umbrella Activation and redefines the Role & benefits of the AAVE assets & tokenomics in the Aave ecosystem.\n\n## Umbrella Coverage Adoption Journey\n\nAs an initial and immediate step:\n\nWe propose segregating StkGHO and StkAAVE Safety Module coverages to distinguish protections and improve StkGHO Safety Module efficiency, which would protect the GHO stablecoin.\n\nWith this upgrade, the StkGHO Safety Module is meant to only protect users from GHO debt and is mobilized to clear GHO excess debt only.\n\nGHO is a young stablecoin with limited secondary liquidity. In the current stage of GHO maturity, mobilizing GHO to protect other assets' debt will mean the death of the GHO peg and trust in GHO for limited resources gained.\n\nHowever, in the context of GHO debt protection only, StkGHO is a perfect tool. In case of a shortfall event, GHO can be seized in the Safety Module and used to clear excess debt by burning GHO. This action is absolutely slippage-free and will not impact the GHO peg.\n\nSafety Module users will suffer a below 1 StkGHO <> GHO exchange rate, but it's a risk they willingly accepted by staking.\n\nExample: If there's 100M GHO in the Safety Module and the protocol suffers a $3M excess debt GHO shortfall event, via an AIP, 3M GHO will be seized from the Safety Module to clear the debt. As a result, the StkGHO/GHO exchange rate will drop to 0.97, leading to a socialized net haircut of 3% for all Safety Module stakers (around 6 weeks of the current reward rate).\n\nThis paradigm shift will make GHO the safest and most trustworthy stablecoin in the ecosystem with currently both an average overcollateralization ratio of 2.5 and ~65% of the supply that can be mobilized to clear any form of excess debt without impacting the GHO peg.\n\nThis will de facto make Ethereum StkGHO the first Safety Module adopting the Umbrella standard.\n\nThese changes come at the cost of temporarily reduced overall V3 protection, but as discussed earlier, GHO is not mature enough to be a suitable asset to protect other debts than GHO at this moment. The reduced protection will be covered by the introduction of new Safety Modules in further steps.\n\nWe propose adopting the following:\n\n### Umbrella coverage adoption Journey doctrine:\n\n1. The Legacy Safety Module coverage is set to all live networks Aave V3 debt until replaced.\n2. The Legacy StkGHO SM protects GHO debt exclusively. This safety module becomes the prime candidate for becoming the first Umbrella safety module instance via upgrade.\n3. The Umbrella Ethereum Safety Modules will not automatically cover Aave V3 deployments; coverage must be opt-in by governance vote.\n4. Mid-term: segregate risk further by deploying network-specific Umbrella Safety Modules financed by protocol \"local\" net excess revenue.\n\n\n### StkGHO Migration and upgrade Journey\n\nGHO is growing and is meant to be a profitable product of the Aave protocol. At ~150/175M GHO, GHO is expected to be net profitable for the protocol, with revenue outpacing system subsidies.\n\nCurrently, GHO has a dual reward system with rewards in AAVE sourced from the ecosystem reserve and Merit airdrops sourced from protocol net profits.\n\nWe propose, in resonance with previous governance decisions, to slowly cut rewards of the StkGHO safety module in favor of a potential Umbrella StkGHO safety module.\n\nThe Merit programs yielded great results in terms of growth, peg preservation, and user behavior optimization. We propose to maintain the Merit program in its current form.\n\nThis will keep a dual reward system for StkGHO: a \"base yield\" paid continuously in GHO to stakers and an \"Airdrop\" yield via Merit that can be optimized to reward more users with net positive behavior for the protocol, maintaining \"boosts\" of most wanted behavior but ensuring a sustainable \"base yield\" for this part of the Safety Module. Both of these rewards are financed by Aave protocol net revenue.\n\nIn practical terms, The Legacy GHO safety module has whitelisted AAVE emissions until Oct 2024 and benefit from Merit, we propose to slowly incentivize user migration to the Umbrella stkGHO by letting the AAVE distribution slowly expire and changing the Merit reward focus on Umbrella on the next Merit round post-publication.\n\nThis will slightly increase cost and efficiency by having a few weeks off incentives on both StkGHO safety module but gains on users experience allowing them to migrate at their own pace justifies it.\n\n## A new role for Aave beyond the Legacy Safety module, AAVENomics update.\n\nAAVE is the center of gravity of the Aave protocol. It is the governance asset of the DAO, allowing true control and ownership of the Aave protocol to a degree not achieved in any other protocol in our industry. But as a Safety Module asset, it's simply not efficient enough. AAVE is not a debt token in the Aave protocol and is not as liquid as ETH and major stablecoins.\n\n### End the \"Seize and Sell\" Doctrine\n\nThe \"seize and sell\" doctrine is dangerous as it's inefficient due to slippage, creates the need to subsidize strong secondary liquidity (StkBPT Safety Module), and causes great price pressure on the asset in case of mobilizing the Safety Module. This reduces the cost of acquiring a large amount of AAVE and taking effective control and ownership of the protocol. With historically 15-30% of the Aave supply in the Safety Module and considering the average governance participation, this risk must be seriously considered.\n\nAdditionally, the relatively low maximum slashing of 30% of the AAVE Safety Module means the protocol is allocating funds that are mostly not even mobilizable to protect the protocol.\n\nLastly, the AAVE Safety Module is not sustainable as it is subsidized by the ecosystem reserve that will eventually run out of funds.\n\nWe propose the AAVE Safety Module to not be included in the Umbrella update, StkAAVE will evolve into a staking role acting as a liquidity sink and a way to collect rewards generated from the protocol revenue and other protocol benefits.\n\n### StkBPT Redefinition\n\nThe Aave DAO has spent large amounts of resources incentivizing AAVE's secondary liquidity to maintain the current Safety Module paradigm.\n\nWhile the secondary liquidity of AAVE is important, it should not be a focus of the Safety Module.\n\nThe DAO earned experience with secondary liquidity management with the Aave Liquidity Committee (ALC) program, yielding great results on GHO peg and growth.\n\nWe propose not including StkBPT from the Umbrella Safety Modules and appoint the ALC to manage AAVE secondary liquidity. We also propose the introduction of a \"Buy & Distribute\" program funded by the protocol's excess revenue, With a budget defined by Aave Finance service providers and management by the ALC.\n\nThe ALC and Aave Finance service providers will continue their journey of decentralization and automatization of these processes, contributing to a future with the human element as removed as possible from these actions.\n\nThis will increase the Safety Module's budget efficiency, make the subsidy of secondary liquidity sustainable, and allow more granular liquidity management. It is expected to optimize the funds needed to maintain the expected outcome.\n\nIn this new system, Liquidity will still be incentivized, but we expect a large optimization in the cost and management of this secondary liquidity.\n\n### Introduction of Anti-GHO\n\nCreating a GHO borrow rate discount was a good idea to align AAVE holders and GHO minters, but the discount mechanism is not efficient in terms of protocol accounting and can be optimized.\n\nWe propose, based on discussions with several service providers, particularly Bgd Labs, the removal of the GHO borrow rate discount and the introduction of a new “anti-GHO” token generated by StkAAVE holders minting GHO.\n\nThe users linearly accumulate anti-GHO, which is claimable at the user's will. Anti-GHO generation is proportionate to the interest accumulated by all GHO borrowers.\n\nAnti-GHO is a non-transferable ERC-20 linked to a couple of special-purpose GHO facilitators that can be used in two ways:\n\n1. Burn Anti-gho to mint GHO used to repay their own GHO debt \"for free.\"\n \n![burn anti gho mint.png](ipfs://bafkreifvldjg2ivjc3x7li4hmv4v4bde5xii6p6vwnlm6cdh62zgtlwv5m)\n    \n\n2. Mint GHO to be deposited on the user’s behalf in the GHO Safety Module and distribute StkGHO to the user.\n\n \n![holders stkaave.jpeg](ipfs://bafkreibylsxdbvqvwllrvmkd3x6b7e6dqcvuo6tnbevzz5g7jppb2hjp7a)\n    \n\n\nBoth special-purpose facilitators' \"debt\" will be regularly \"cleared\" by mobilizing GHO from the Aave Collector via Aave treasury regular AIPs to repay, ensuring no long-term unbacked GHO in the protocol.\n\nThis new system is more efficient, increases the alignment of AAVE stakers with GHO borrowers, and officially introduces revenue sharing of part of the Aave protocol revenue to some AAVE stakers, acting as the initial step of a more ambitious excess revenue-sharing strategy.\n\n### Closing the LEND chapter\n\nNearly 4 Years ago, After the launch of Aave V1, the Aave protocol proposed the initial AAVEnomics migrating the legacy asset LEND into the current AAVE token.\nAfter a significant amount of time passed and witnessing the lack of activity of the legacy asset, we take this proposal as an opportunity to close the LEND chapter.\n\nWe consider that 4 years and the amount of time that will pass for these proposals, publications, approvals, implementations, and execution to offer ample and fair notice to legacy users to migrate to AAVE, we propose to deactivate the legacy migrator contract and transfer the remaining balance to the Ecosystem reserve to be mobilized for Aave Stakers and protocol growth.\n\n## Activate Umbrella Atokens Safety Module, initiate “Buy and Distribute” AAVENomics\n\nThe Aave protocol is seen as the industry standard in terms of resilience and safety, making Safety Modules of Aave a popular option for protecting protocol users despite the risks.\n\nAdditionally, ~80% of the Aave protocol users deposit in the protocol but do not have Aave debt. Their use case of the protocol is to seek yield on liquidity provided. These users consider the Aave protocol safe enough to keep their assets inside the protocol contracts for the long term.\n\nThe paradigm shift to \"seize and burn\" instead of the current \"seize and sell\" increases the Safety Module efficiency significantly. The natural progression of this strategy is to mobilize users who consider the Aave protocol safe enough to hold their assets and do not seek to create debt to consider renouncing their Safety Module protection, their borrowing power and short-term aToken liquidity (cooldown period) in exchange for extra yield.\n\nThis is done by adding a Atoken category to the Umbrella Safety Module. In case of a shortfall event, these tokens are seized and used to burn debt, just as the StkGHO Umbrella Safety Module will function.\n\nMost of the Aave protocol debt is in wETH and stablecoins.\n\nTherefore, we are gathering feedback on the initiation of Umbrella Atoken Safety Modules with awETH and aUSDC.\n\nThis allows for covering most of the debt in the protocol if these assets need to be mobilized.\nBecause debt can be repaid in aTokens in Aave V3, the available secondary liquidity of these aTokens is not relevant in excess debt clearing.\n\nTo cover debt labeled in other assets, USDC and ETH are the most liquid assets in the ecosystem, making slippage considerations a low issue, especially with a focused scope of Safety Module coverage introduced earlier.\n\naTokens Safety Modules are proposed to be primarily rewarded in their respective aTokens, financed by their respective Reserve Factor collection on their assets and correlated assets.\n\nUmbrella multi-reward support allows for more mid-term synergies for “Re-Staking”, which will be explored further in this TEMP CHECK.\n\nDetails and budgets of these Umbrella Atokens Safety modules should be discussed at the ARFC stage with feedback from both Risk & Finance teams.\n\nWe’re confident this will allow a factually superior coverage of the Aave V3 protocol at a fraction of the current costs.\n\n### Activate a \"Buy & Distribute\" Program\n\nWith the new efficient Umbrella safety modules, it is expected that the protocol revenue surplus will increase. With sustainability reached milestones, this net excess revenue should be mobilized and redirected to token stakers currently funded via the ecosystem rewards contract.\n\nIn terms of rewards, the ecosystem rewards will eventually run out of funds. That being said, we propose that StkAAVE remains compensated in AAVE tokens as stakers are already aligned with the asset. To achieve this, a \"Buy & Distribute\" program is introduced to acquire AAVE assets on secondary markets from protocol revenue and distribute them to the ecosystem reserve. This upgrades the current AAVE safety module in a new “Staking Module”, not part of Umbrella.\n\nThere's little to no difference in user experience from the current situation, but in terms of protocol sustainability, it's a paradigm shift. This new system also introduces a constant demand side for the AAVE asset on secondary markets.\n\nIt is proposed that this program be funded with the net excess revenue of the protocol.\n\nRewards rates will be defined according to protocol net excess revenue and will reflect the actual financial results of the protocols, with periods of higher rewards to potential periods with zero yield.\n\nWe propose that the Aave Finance service providers manage the \"Buy & Distribute\" program via treasury AIPs to increase efficiency in the short term. We believe this process also needs to be part of the Journey of decentralization, and we expect the Aave Finance service providers to contribute to a future with the human element as removed as possible from this program \n\nFor an easier understanding of the new AAVEnomics vision, please consider the following visual representation:\n\n \n![visual representation.jpeg](ipfs://bafybeigfqm7tms5yc2homzrgar6ikt6bbplco4cejmqg5i7jqngalmm2eq)\n    \n\n## “Re-Staking” Umbrella Beyond Aave\n\nAave's Safety track record speaks for itself; while Aave had several excess debt events, the DAO never had to mobilize the legacy Safety module. With the Umbrella upgrade, we expect the efficient coverage to increase significantly compared to the current situation, from a theoretical $100m to likely billions of mid-terms.\n\nThe Aave DAO can mobilize and monetize this coverage beyond the Aave protocol. The Aave DAO service providers are risk experts who can give valuable coverage recommendations to the Aave governance.\n\nThe Umbrella multi-token incentives controller allows for rewards in several tokens, and we believe this cost-efficient coverage of already existing significant liquidity will be of high interest for third-party protocols and networks, as shown by the high interest of the “Restaking” DeFi vertical.\n\nWhile the journey to maturity on this vertical is still long, the ACI wanted to share this mid-term vision to the community of a potential new journey for protocol revenue and Umbrella Stakers Yield.\n\n## Specification\n\n### Milestones and Trigger Conditions\n\nWhile the Aave protocol's net excess revenues are at an all-time high, it would be reckless to implement significant new budget spending without considering the protocol's long-term sustainability.\nFrom a user experience perspective, a too-ambitious distribution schedule being forced to halt due to more adverse revenue collection conditions will lead to massive and unwanted frustration.\nThe Aave DAO has always been a conservative actor and has always prioritized long-term sustainability over short-term yield.\n\nWe suggest considering the following elements as key data points to execute changes in Safety Modules in steps:\n\n- Aave Collector net holdings\n- Service providers' recurring budget\n- Merit and ALC program recurring budgets\n- GHO supply\n- GHO 30-day average revenue\n- Protocol 30-day average revenue\n\nThe ACI Proposes this vision to be implemented in 3 differents ARFCs to be sequentially proposed alongside reaching set milestones, we welcome governance feedback on this implementation Journey.\n\n## Initial ARFC Doctrine Adoption and Deployment of First Umbrella Safety Module: StkGHO\n\nAdoption of the Following Doctrine:\n\n1.
