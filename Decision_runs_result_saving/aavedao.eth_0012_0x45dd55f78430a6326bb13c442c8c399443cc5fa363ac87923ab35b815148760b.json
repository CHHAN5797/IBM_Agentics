        "body": "## [ARFC] Onboard Pendle PT tokens to Aave V3 Core Instance\n\n## Author: ACI\n\n## Date: 2025-01-07\n\n### **Summary**\n\nThis ARFC proposes to onboard Pendle PT tokens to Aave V3 Core Instance. \n\n### **Motivation**\n\nPendle allows users to split yield bearing tokens into principal (PT) and yield (YT) components. This opens the door to trading yield for the growing number of yield bearing tokens, and gives users additional options for  yield farming strategies. A notable feature of the PT tokens is that at the maturity date, the value of the PT equals the value of the underlying asset and can be redeemed for the underlying. This means PT tokens, which can be bought at a discount within Pendle pools, represent the fixed rate part of a Pendle asset pair. \n\nPendle has seen extremely high growth this year, with current TVL of circa $4.5 billion. Along with this growth has come the desire for yield traders to borrow against their Pendle PT tokens. This represents a multi-billion dollar growth opportunity for Aave, without a large increase in risk if PT  tokens are onboarded for already listed assets such as sUSDe.\n\nWe propose listing an initial PT token as a test use case to see user demand and work through the full integration of a PT token: \n\n- PT-sUSDE-29MAY2025\n\nIn future we propose listing sUSDe and USDe PT tokens for new maturities as required.\n\n### **Specification**\n\nPT-sUSDE-29MAY2025: [0xb7de5dfcb74d25c2f21841fbd6230355c50d9308](https://etherscan.io/address/0xb7de5dfcb74d25c2f21841fbd6230355c50d9308)\n\n### Risk Parameters\n\nRisk parameters will be provided by Risk Service Providers in the ARFC and will be updated accordingly.\n\n### **Useful Links**\n\nhttps://docs.pendle.finance/ProtocolMechanics/YieldTokenization/PT\n\n[**[TEMP CHECK] Onboard Pendle PT tokens to Aave V3 Core Instance**](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-onboard-pendle-pt-tokens-to-aave-v3-core-instance/20131) \n\n[**[TEMP CHECK Snapshot] Onboard Pendle PT tokens to Aave V3 Core Instance**](https://snapshot.box/#/s:aave.eth/proposal/0x857fea8a5adadd066965f3107f1578a3cce94ec59bf45f46565fa22cfaac9d67)\n\n### Disclaimer\n\nACI is not directly affiliated with Pendle and did not receive compensation for creation this proposal. Some ACI employees may hold Pendle tokens.\n\n### **Next Steps**\n\n1. Publish ARFC to gather community and Service Providers feedback.\n2. Escalate the proposal to ARFC snapshot stage if feedback is positive.\n3. If the ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, publish an AIP vote for final confirmation and enforcement of the proposal.\n\n### Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived under [CCO](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)",

It’s unique in that it meets the security and compliance standards needed to serve both individual and institutional participants, and LsETH has recently gained traction with the Ethereum Treasury Company market. \n\nOver the past two months TVL has rapidly increased as the Crypto Treasury Company sector has gained traction, with TVL currently sitting around $1.3bn. We believe this sector will continue to see growth and present a set of new users to introduce to Aave.\n\n## **Chain to be deployed/listed**\n\nAave v3 Core instance on Ethereum mainnet.\n\n### **Proof of Liquidity and Deposit Commitments**\n\n- $200m of lsETH deposits are committed in the first 3 months after onboarding.\n- 0.25-1% of token is committed to Aave incentives post-TGE.\n\n## Specification\n\nToken Contract: 0x8c1bed5b9a0928467c9b1341da1d7bd5e10b6549\n\n### Risk Parameters:\n\nInitial Risk Parameters will be provided by Risk service providers during the ARFC phase.\n\n## **Useful Links**\n\nDune dashboard: https://dune.com/liquidcollective/liquidcollective\n\nDocs: https://docs.liquidcollective.io/v1/\n\n## **Disclaimer**\n\nThe Aave Chan Initiative is not directly affiliated with Liquid Collective and did not receive compensation for creating this proposal.\n\n## **Next Steps**\n\n1. Period of discussion on this TEMP CHECK.\n2. TEMP CHECK Snapshot vote for this proposal.\n3. If TEMP CHECK is a YAE, publish a standard ARFC, collect community & service providers feedback before escalating proposal to ARFC snapshot stage.\n4. If the ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, publish an AIP vote for final confirmation and enforcement of the proposal.\n\n## **Copyright**\n\nCopyright and related rights waived under [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

        "body": "[TEMP CHECK] Deploy Aave v3 on Tron\nAuthor: ACI\nDate: 2025-04-18\nSimple Summary\nThis Temp Check seeks the community’s input on the deployment of Aave V3 on Tron Mainnet.\n\nBackground\nTron is the second ranking EVM blockchain in terms of bridged TVL after Ethereum with circa $73bn of value bridged. Almost $69bn of this is stablecoins. We believe that it is time for Aave to deploy on Tron to access this liquidity and allow Tron users to access Aave to earn yield on their stablecoins and borrow against collateral.\n\nMotivation\nAave has deployed on multiple promising new L1 and L2 EVM networks and is often one of the largest protocols on these networks. Tron stands out as a significant opportunity which Aave has previously overlooked, we believe it is time for that to change. It is time for Aave to deploy on the second largest EVM blockchain and allow Aave users the opportunity to access the $69bn of stablecoins and $73bn of bridged value on Tron. This represents a significant opportunity for Aave to grow TVL, revenue, and access a brand new market from which Aave is conspicuously absent.\n\nProof of Liquidity (POL) and Deposit Commitments\nThe Tron DAO has committed to deposit funds at deployment of the instance to bootstrap liquidity.\n\nMore details will be shared at ARFC stage.\n\nSpecification\nRisk Parameters will be provided by Service Providers and this section will be updated at ARFC stage if proposal moves forward, after successful TEMP CHECK Snapshot.\n\nDisclaimer\nThis proposal is powered by Skywards. The ACI is not directly affiliated with Tron and did not receive any compensation for creating this proposal.\n\nNext Steps\nIf consensus is reached on this [TEMP CHECK], this proposal will be escalated to the Snapshot stage.\nIf the Snapshot outcome is YAE, this proposal will be escalated to ARFC stage.\nPublication of a standard ARFC, collect community & service providers feedback before escalating proposal to ARFC snapshot stage.\nIf the ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, publish an AIP vote for final confirmation and enforcement of the proposal.\nCopyright\nCopyright and related rights waived under CC0",
