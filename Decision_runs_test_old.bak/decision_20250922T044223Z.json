      "body": "## Summary\n\nLlamaRisk supports the deployment of GHO on Ink. With GHO successfully scaling across L2s, further expansion of its availability is a logical next step. Our analysis indicates that GHO is well-positioned for additional cross-chain deployments, particularly on Ink, where it has the potential to become the primary stablecoin under current market conditions. As for GSMs supporting GHO peg stability, we do not recommend deploying the (stata)USDC.e GSM due to the limited [USDC.e market supply of 2.43M](https://explorer.inkonchain.com/token/0xF1815bd50389c46847f0Bda824eC8da914045D14) on Ink.\n\n## Current GHO Scale\n\n![image|1279x633](upload://aHVxoaHkeWwIHGBUN8Y1ClVLBrH.png)\n*Source: GHO Total Supply, [Dune](https://dune.com/queries/2734680/4551181), July 26, 2025*\n\nGHO is available on Ethereum Mainnet, Arbitrum, Base, Lens, and most recently, Avalanche. Its total supply now fluctuates around 315M, marking an all-time high. This represents a YTD growth of over 115% from a supply of 146.7M at the beginning of the year.\n\n## Network-specific Considerations\n\nInk is an L2 built on Optimism’s OP Stack and launched by Kraken. As part of the Superchain, it inherits Ethereum’s security and complies with the SuperchainERC20 standard, enhancing cross-chain interoperability. However, Ink’s DeFi ecosystem remains nascent, as reflected by its relatively low TVL of $9.28M compared to a total value secured [(TVS) of $103.5M](https://l2beat.com/scaling/projects/ink/tvs-breakdown). This disparity suggests that most bridged assets remain idle, with limited participation in DeFi protocols on Ink.\n\n![image|961x336](upload://leyT37AqSR0lFPJUYMtnENoCZCp.png)\n*Source: Ink TVL and Stablecoin Marketcap, [DeFiLlama](https://defillama.com/chain/ink?stablecoinsMcap=true), July 26, 2025*\n\nInk’s stablecoin ecosystem is in its early stages, currently dominated by [USDT0](https://explorer.inkonchain.com/token/0x0200C29006150606B650577BBE7B6248F58470c1), with a market supply of $75M, while the [Stargate-bridged USDC.e](https://explorer.inkonchain.com/token/0xF1815bd50389c46847f0Bda824eC8da914045D14) lags behind with a market cap of $2.43M. This presents a significant growth opportunity for GHO on Ink. The upcoming [launch of a whitelabel Aave instance](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-deploy-a-whitelabel-aave-v3-instance-on-ink/22390) (approved at the ARFC stage, pending AIP) is expected by the team to drive a targeted $1B in TVL to Ink, potentially serving as a strong catalyst for GHO adoption and growth on the network.\n\n### Liquidity Venues\n\n![image|1159x720](upload://dT4I7OyBT9yHNmnQKtvBWUHpcyV.png)\n*Source: Top 5 Velodrome Liquidity Pools on Ink, [Velodrome](https://velodrome.finance/liquidity?filters=Ink), July 26, 2025*\n\nAs of July 26, 2025, the total TVL across DEXs on Ink is approximately $9M, with [Velodrome](https://velodrome.finance/liquidity?filters=Ink) and [InkySwap](https://www.inkyswap.com/pool/view) accounting for the majority with $6M and $2M TVLs, respectively. The current liquidity is insufficient to support large trades with low price impact, and most transaction volume is concentrated on Velodrome. Therefore, securing initial GHO liquidity on Velodrome will be critical in driving early growth. This foundational liquidity can later support further increases in GHO supply and borrow caps on Ink.\n\n### Yield Venues\n\n![image|905x600](upload://qZmcYnFTaiKMSkLTKHld4c3A8kk.png)\n\n*Source: DeFi Projects on Ink by TVL, [DeFiLlama](https://defillama.com/chain/ink), July 26, 2025*\n\nAs seen from the current protocol landscape, stablecoin yield opportunities on Ink are limited. [Shroomy Protocol](https://app.shroomy.io/), an Aave V3 fork, is the only lending market, with just $67K in TVL. Yield aggregators [vfat.io](https://vfat.io/yield?chains=57073&points=no_points-superStacks&farmTypes=volatile-stable-concentrated&protocols=velodrome-uniswap_v4-quickswap-equalizer-shadow-atlantis-ra-pancakeSwap-ramses-uniswap-sushiswap-blackhole-pharaoh-merchantMoe-cleo-nuri-thena-nile-aerodrome-hyperswap-oku) and [TheDeep](https://app.thedeep.ink/explore) have a combined TVL of $230K. [Dinero](https://ink.dinero.xyz/), an ETH liquid staking platform on Ink, issues iETH and currently offers a 4% staking APR. However, the yield environment is expected to improve with the upcoming launch of Ink’s whitelabeled Aave instance. The team is optimistic, projecting $1B in TVL within 90 days of launch. Additionally, Ink’s backing by Kraken could attract significant capital and users, similar to Coinbase’s impact on Base, leveraging Kraken’s existing exchange user base to drive a broader range of assets and yield opportunities over time.\n\n### Facilitators\n\nGHO will be first minted on Mainnet and then bridged to Ink using the CCIP Bridge Facilitator. The initial configuration for the Ink GhoDirectMinter facilitator is set to have a mint cap of 15M GHO.\n\n### GSM\n\nDeploying GSM modules and expanding to new chains is a robust and welcome approach to enhancing GHO stability. However, the current [USDC.e supply on Ink is limited to just 2.43M](https://explorer.inkonchain.com/token/0xF1815bd50389c46847f0Bda824eC8da914045D14), making it vulnerable to significant borrow and supply rate fluctuations if a (stata)USDC.e GSM were deployed. This low supply would also limit the GSM’s effectiveness in stabilizing the GHO peg. Therefore, we recommend holding off on deploying a GSM until the market matures further.\n\n### Recommended Parameters\n\nLlamaRisk supports the parameter specification provided by TokenLogic for GHO, including facilitator mint cap, CCIP configuration, and GHO market parameters.\n\n### Disclaimer\n\nThis review was independently prepared by LlamaRisk, a community-led decentralized organization funded in part by the Aave DAO.

      "body": "## Overview\n\nChaos Labs supports the proposal to deploy GHO on Ink and appoint ACI as the Emissions Manager to oversee GHO rewards and incentives and the use of stataUSDT0 as the primary asset for the GSM on the Ink instance. Our assessment takes into account GHO’s current market position, as well as the proposed risk parameters and infrastructure for its integration with Ink.\n\n## GHO\n\nLaunching GHO on Ink aligns with Aave’s broader strategy for multi‑chain expansion. Having already shown strong growth on Ethereum, Arbitrum, and Base, extending GHO to Ink offers a logical path to drive further adoption and improve accessibility across the wider ecosystem.\n\nOverall, GHO has experienced solid growth over the past three months, with its supply rising from about 240M to 310M. As of this writing, its total market capitalization is roughly $304M.\n\n![Screenshot 2025-07-31 at 4.26.33 PM|2000x686](upload://py49SGXGjbhCtwSHkTeJdg5JOR5.png)\n\nGHO’s expansion to other networks has also shown observable effects. For instance, on Base, GHO has maintained a strong growth trend over the past three months. While there has been a slight decline in the past two weeks, its supply has still grown by 10M compared to May 2025.\n\n![Screenshot 2025-07-31 at 4.30.38 PM|2000x696](upload://AbrWZ3VU3WudMhI91HDMtVMu7U.png)\n\n## Ink\n\nInk is still in its early stages but has already demonstrated strong growth momentum. Since launch, its TVL has been on a steady upward trajectory, rising from around $6M to $10M over the past two months, indicating increasing engagement in DeFi activities on the network.\n\n![Screenshot 2025-07-31 at 4.35.09 PM|2000x641](upload://ywOW95uWGBcOkaGJa31fGdEIDUq.png)\n\n**[Ink TVL Over Time](https://defillama.com/chain/ink)**\n\nAt the same time, its TVS has settled at around $100M and has remained stable over the past three months, with no significant declines or major fluctuations.\n\n![Screenshot 2025-07-31 at 4.43.55 PM|2000x633](upload://qoW3rt196FC2M0ZK8LVIXihzbkA.png)\n\n**[Ink TVS Over Time](https://l2beat.com/scaling/projects/ink/tvs-breakdown)**\n\n### **GSM Implementation**\n\nWe support the implementation of a stataUSDT0.ink GSM, after discussion with the Ink’s team, we expect sufficient supply to be available at launch. With ample supply and market liquidity, stataUSDT0 is expected to be an effective stabilization asset for the GSM, capable of absorbing fluctuations around the GHO peg. Additionally, a large and more liquid USDT0 market will help keep interest rates for borrowing and lending USDT0 more stable and less prone to sudden spikes or drops.\n\n### **Steward Authority Framework**\n\nThe governance framework gives GHO Stewards the authority to adjust parameters within set boundaries, achieving a balance between flexibility and prudent risk management. This structure allows for timely updates to borrow caps, interest rates, supply caps, and GSM parameters within defined limits, enabling the system to respond quickly to changing market conditions while maintaining governance oversight. Experience from previous GHO deployments shows that this approach has been effective in preserving stability during the early launch phase and supporting ongoing growth.\n\n### Parameter Recommendations\n\nWe support the proposed GHO parameters for Ink. Setting the initial supply cap at 5M and the borrow cap at 4.5M provides a balanced approach, limiting risk during the early adoption phase while maintaining sufficient liquidity, which is reasonable given Ink’s current scale.\n\n## **Disclaimer**\n\nChaos Labs has not been compensated by any third party for publishing this recommendation.\n\n## **Copyright**\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain)",
