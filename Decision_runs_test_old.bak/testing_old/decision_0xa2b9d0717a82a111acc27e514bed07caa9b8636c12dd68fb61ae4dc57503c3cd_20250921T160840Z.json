    "summary": "The proposal to deploy Aave V3 on Plasma is supported by strong voting preference and cautious but positive risk assessments from expert providers. Plasma is a new high-performance blockchain optimized for stablecoins with promising early testnet activity. Despite missing TVL and price impact data due to lack of cache, evidence from discussion and votes supports approval.",

      "Plasma offers zero fees, fast transactions, and robust security tailored for stablecoins.",
