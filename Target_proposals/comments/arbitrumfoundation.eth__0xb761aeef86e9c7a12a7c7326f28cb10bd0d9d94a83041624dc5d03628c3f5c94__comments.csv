<li><strong>Abstract</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This proposal seeks a 12 weeks extension (until November 30) of the Pyth Network’s <a href=""https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/pyth-network-ltipp-application-draft/22003"">previously approved LTIPP grant</a>.</p>
<p>Initially, the Pyth Network was allocated 1,000,000 ARB through the LTIPP process. To date, we have utilized approximately 75,042 ARB over the 12-week duration of the program.</p>
<p>We are requesting to retain 174,958 ARB, bringing our total expenditure to 250,000 ARB out of the original 1,000,000, until the new grant programs are established.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Motivation</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>We want to highlight that incentives for infrastructure protocols and public goods, such as the Pyth oracle, typically do not yield immediate results. The impact from making such incentives available to DeFi often unfolds over weeks or even months.</p>
<p>For existing DeFi applications, switching to a new oracle involves significant effort and may require a new audit. Similarly, expanding from other chains to Arbitrum can be more time-consuming than anticipated, as illustrated by the Synthetix case <a href=""https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/synthetix-ltipp-application-final/22023/20"">here</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks to the initial LTIPP program, Arbitrum dApps had the ability to build robust oracle systems covering over 500 assets, including cryptocurrencies, FX, stocks, ETFs, and commodities. This advancement has eliminated outdated on-chain price updates and high costs, reinforcing Arbitrum’s position as a premier layer for DeFi. This progress empowers developers to create cutting-edge applications without constraints. This extension aims to keep the momentum and further empower potential new entrants like Synthetix to deliver a best-in-class protocol.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rationale</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The proposed extension of the Pyth Network’s LTIPP grant is designed to further cultivate a thriving and innovative DeFi ecosystem on Arbitrum. The LTIPP program has already proven its effectiveness, with Pyth price updates on-chain increasing by 2-3 times and peaking at nearly 10 times the previous levels, reaching over 70,000 updates on July 14.</p>
<p>Before the program began, the total value secured by the Pyth oracle on Arbitrum was just over 43,000 ETH. This figure has since risen to 52,500 ETH, reflecting an increase of more than 20%.</p>
<p>Pyth has also enabled over $16.1 billion in trading volume on various Arbitrum decentralized perpetual exchanges during June and July (with August data pending). This  underscores the benefits for applications powered by Pyth Network: protocols using Pyth have experienced, including increased total value locked (TVL), higher trading volumes, and more frequent price updates driven by a growing number of applications utilizing Pyth.</p>
<p>The request for a 12-week extension, with a reduced ARB allocation, is part of our commitment towards responsible resource management commitment to responsible resource management while continuing to support the long-term success of applications built on Arbitrum that leverage Pyth. By covering the gas costs for using the Pyth oracle, the network has enabled more developers to create robust DeFi applications without the burden of high operational expenses.</p>
<p>This strategy strengthens Arbitrum’s position as a premier platform for DeFi innovation, where developers can access over 500 price feeds without financial or technical constraints.</p>
<p>It’s important to understand that the impact of incentives for infastructure protocols and public goods like the Pyth price oracle are not immediate: it often takes weeks or even months to materialize.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it’s important to recognize that the impact of incentives for infrastructure protocols and public goods like the Pyth oracle is not immediate; it often takes weeks or even months to materialize.</p>
<p>This proposal, aims to build on the momentum generated by the initial LTIPP program, ensuring the continued growth and expansion of the Arbitrum ecosystem as new grant strategies are developed and implemented.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Key Terms</strong></li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>On-demand or pull oracle: An oracle network where anyone can permissionlessly trigger price updates on-chain by doing an Arbitrum tx</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>Specifications</strong></li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>13 weeks duration</li>
<li>175,000 ARB</li>
</ol>
<p>The proposed extension duration is similar to that of the previous LTIPP program—12 weeks versus 13 weeks (including retroactive rebates for the end of August). However, the amount of ARB tokens requested for gas rebates has increased from 75,000 ARB to 175,000 ARB.</p>
<p>This increase reflects an anticipated rise in activity and associated costs, estimated at approximately 133%. The launch of Synthetix’s Multi-Collateral Perps on Arbitrum is expected to drive a substantial increase in the number of price updates triggered on-chain. For context, Synthetix currently triggers around 1,000 daily updates on Optimism and between 3,000 and 5,000 daily updates on Base—both without additional incentives in place.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Steps to Implement</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>If the Arbitrum DAO approves this extension, no additional work or involvement will be required from the DAO itself. The responsibility for managing the funds and continuing the program would remain entirely with the Pyth Data Association.</p>
<p>As during the initial 12 weeks of the LTIPP, the Pyth Data Association would continue reimbursing dApps for gas costs every two weeks. Additionally, we would maintain our practice of providing bi-weekly updates on the Arbitrum forum to ensure transparency and accountability. Our latest report is available <a href=""https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/pyth-network-bi-weekly-update-26-august-2024/26525"">here</a>, and we are open to including even more detailed data and information in these reports if needed.</p>
<p>Since this is an extension of an already approved grant, no additional legal work is necessary. The Pyth Data Association has already completed KYC and signed the grant agreement with the Arbitrum Foundation.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Timeline</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The LTIPP program officially ended on August 26, and until this extension proposal is approved, the Pyth Data Association has paused reimbursing the gas costs incurred by dApps during this period.</p>
<p>If approved, the extension would be applied retroactively, starting from the end of the LTIPP program on August 26. This means that, depending on the timing of the Snapshot vote, there could be up to 2-3 weeks of retroactive gas rebates.</p>
<p>The proposed extension would conclude on November 30, 2024.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Overall Cost</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The cost to the Arbitrum DAO can be seen as an opportunity cost of 174,958 ARB, or potentially even less. Originally, the DAO approved a grant of 1,000,000 ARB—funds that were effectively budgeted and allocated—of which only 75,042 ARB was utilized during the 12-week LTIPP period.</p>
<p>We are now requesting to retain 174,958 ARB from the initial allocation to continue offsetting costs for DeFi applications that use Pyth’s on-demand price feeds. The remaining 750,000 ARB will be returned to the Arbitrum DAO as previously agreed under the LTIPP program. Furthermore, if any funds remain unspent before the outlined timeline concludes, Pyth Data Association will promptly return those ARB tokens to the DAO.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Additional Context</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>We have been actively seeking feedback and advice from <a class=""mention"" href=""/u/matt_stablelab"">@Matt_StableLab</a> to determine the best approach for moving forward with this extension request.</p>
<p>Our interest in extending the LTIPP grant was initiated in the original LTIPP discussion <a href=""https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/pyth-network-ltipp-application-draft/22003/10"">here</a>.</p>
<p>Currently, we plan to submit this extension request on Snapshot by Thursday, September 5, with support from Wintermute. This timeline allows ample opportunity to gather feedback on the proposal and make any necessary adjustments based on input from the DAO.</p>
<p>Please note that Wintermute will merely be sponsoring the proposal as a delegate which is separate from their role as an LTIPP Council member.</p>"

<p>As for any oracle (or infrastructure provider), success is measured by the success of those who depend upon it. The initial LTIPP program granted to the Pyth oracle has already shown a great success in increasing key metrics for Arbitrum DeFi apps such an increase in TVL, trading volume (for perpetual protocols) and a significantly greater availability of freely available price updates onchain (reminder that reading Pyth prices onchain is free, only writing incurs costs).</p>
<p>By extending the program, Pyth Network aims to build on this momentum, ensuring that Arbitrum remains a leading layer for DeFi innovation.</p>
<p>For the latter question, the first thing that comes to mind is the support of the tentative/upcoming stARB token with a Pyth price feed. This would enable all Arbitrum dApps (money-market to perpetual protocols) to integrate and support this asset that is likely to get a significant traction given its properties.</p>
<p>A positive side-effect outside of Arbitrum is that a Pyth stARB price feed would also be automatically available on all the other chains (70+) Pyth supports - and here Arbitrum Orbit chains could also greatly benefit from that as the Pyth oracle expands there.</p>
<p>And as a matter of fact, the Pyth oracle has been <a href=""https://xchain-explorer.idex.io/address/0x2880aB155794e7179c9eE2e38200202908C17B43"" rel=""noopener nofollow ugc"">deployed on XCHAIN</a>, a brand new Orbit chain for IDEX, an omnichain perpetual protocol.</p>"

<p>educated and wild guess on my side, the application was crafted and evaluated with pre dencun metrics. This has been one of the (several) challenges for both protocols and advisors during LTIPP program. Since in the <a href=""https://www.arbgrants.com/d/Arbitrum%20LTIPP/Grants-M-R/Pyth-Network"" rel=""noopener nofollow ugc"">PYTH reporting</a> there is no mention of specific delay in integration, I might just be right here but happy to have more details. Also, the byproduct of this result for future program could be that for infra projects a pre-allocated budget might not be the way to got.</p>
<p>Going back to the snapshot, as for the synthetix application, I am, unfortunately, voting against it, as well as the other extention requests in Arbitrum. To quote my previous answer:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I would have normally been in favour if it wasn’t for the detox proposal just recently presented, and passed, in our DAO; but that proposal is an extremely important signal about 1) trying to see what happens to our chains with no incentives 2) give the time to the DAO to best reflect how to weaponize these programs in future. There is also the secondary point, not necessarily as important but indeed important, about competitive advantages of protocols asking for an extention versus protocols that just finished in LTIPP or about to finish in STIP.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>In here we have a different situation, which is a potential usage of funds for an infra product, so I could see the merit of the extention. But the mix of the detox proposal + the fact that most of the leftover funds are tied, in my understanding, to lower costs than expected, means that the only real reason to keep Pyth in an extention would be to facilitate his role in Arbitrum. This is something we could advocate for Synthetix and Aave as well, even if their role is different. Again, the vote of the DAO for the detox proposal is more important, and should just be respected by participants.</p>"

<li><strong>Abstract</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This proposal seeks a 12 weeks extension (until November 30) of the Pyth Network’s <a href=""https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/pyth-network-ltipp-application-draft/22003"">previously approved LTIPP grant</a>.</p>
<p>Initially, the Pyth Network was allocated 1,000,000 ARB through the LTIPP process. To date, we have utilized approximately 75,042 ARB over the 12-week duration of the program.</p>
<p>We are requesting to retain 174,958 ARB, bringing our total expenditure to 250,000 ARB out of the original 1,000,000, until the new grant programs are established.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Motivation</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>We want to highlight that incentives for infrastructure protocols and public goods, such as the Pyth oracle, typically do not yield immediate results. The impact from making such incentives available to DeFi often unfolds over weeks or even months.</p>
<p>For existing DeFi applications, switching to a new oracle involves significant effort and may require a new audit. Similarly, expanding from other chains to Arbitrum can be more time-consuming than anticipated, as illustrated by the Synthetix case <a href=""https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/synthetix-ltipp-application-final/22023/20"">here</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks to the initial LTIPP program, Arbitrum dApps had the ability to build robust oracle systems covering over 500 assets, including cryptocurrencies, FX, stocks, ETFs, and commodities. This advancement has eliminated outdated on-chain price updates and high costs, reinforcing Arbitrum’s position as a premier layer for DeFi. This progress empowers developers to create cutting-edge applications without constraints. This extension aims to keep the momentum and further empower potential new entrants like Synthetix to deliver a best-in-class protocol.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rationale</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The proposed extension of the Pyth Network’s LTIPP grant is designed to further cultivate a thriving and innovative DeFi ecosystem on Arbitrum. The LTIPP program has already proven its effectiveness, with Pyth price updates on-chain increasing by 2-3 times and peaking at nearly 10 times the previous levels, reaching over 70,000 updates on July 14.</p>
<p>Before the program began, the total value secured by the Pyth oracle on Arbitrum was just over 43,000 ETH. This figure has since risen to 52,500 ETH, reflecting an increase of more than 20%.</p>
<p>Pyth has also enabled over $16.1 billion in trading volume on various Arbitrum decentralized perpetual exchanges during June and July (with August data pending). This  underscores the benefits for applications powered by Pyth Network: protocols using Pyth have experienced, including increased total value locked (TVL), higher trading volumes, and more frequent price updates driven by a growing number of applications utilizing Pyth.</p>
<p>The request for a 12-week extension, with a reduced ARB allocation, is part of our commitment towards responsible resource management commitment to responsible resource management while continuing to support the long-term success of applications built on Arbitrum that leverage Pyth. By covering the gas costs for using the Pyth oracle, the network has enabled more developers to create robust DeFi applications without the burden of high operational expenses.</p>
<p>This strategy strengthens Arbitrum’s position as a premier platform for DeFi innovation, where developers can access over 500 price feeds without financial or technical constraints.</p>
<p>It’s important to understand that the impact of incentives for infastructure protocols and public goods like the Pyth price oracle are not immediate: it often takes weeks or even months to materialize.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it’s important to recognize that the impact of incentives for infrastructure protocols and public goods like the Pyth oracle is not immediate; it often takes weeks or even months to materialize.</p>
<p>This proposal, aims to build on the momentum generated by the initial LTIPP program, ensuring the continued growth and expansion of the Arbitrum ecosystem as new grant strategies are developed and implemented.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Key Terms</strong></li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>On-demand or pull oracle: An oracle network where anyone can permissionlessly trigger price updates on-chain by doing an Arbitrum tx</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>Specifications</strong></li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>13 weeks duration</li>
<li>175,000 ARB</li>
</ol>
<p>The proposed extension duration is similar to that of the previous LTIPP program—12 weeks versus 13 weeks (including retroactive rebates for the end of August). However, the amount of ARB tokens requested for gas rebates has increased from 75,000 ARB to 175,000 ARB.</p>
<p>This increase reflects an anticipated rise in activity and associated costs, estimated at approximately 133%. The launch of Synthetix’s Multi-Collateral Perps on Arbitrum is expected to drive a substantial increase in the number of price updates triggered on-chain. For context, Synthetix currently triggers around 1,000 daily updates on Optimism and between 3,000 and 5,000 daily updates on Base—both without additional incentives in place.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Steps to Implement</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>If the Arbitrum DAO approves this extension, no additional work or involvement will be required from the DAO itself. The responsibility for managing the funds and continuing the program would remain entirely with the Pyth Data Association.</p>
<p>As during the initial 12 weeks of the LTIPP, the Pyth Data Association would continue reimbursing dApps for gas costs every two weeks. Additionally, we would maintain our practice of providing bi-weekly updates on the Arbitrum forum to ensure transparency and accountability. Our latest report is available <a href=""https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/pyth-network-bi-weekly-update-26-august-2024/26525"">here</a>, and we are open to including even more detailed data and information in these reports if needed.</p>
<p>Since this is an extension of an already approved grant, no additional legal work is necessary. The Pyth Data Association has already completed KYC and signed the grant agreement with the Arbitrum Foundation.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Timeline</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The LTIPP program officially ended on August 26, and until this extension proposal is approved, the Pyth Data Association has paused reimbursing the gas costs incurred by dApps during this period.</p>
<p>If approved, the extension would be applied retroactively, starting from the end of the LTIPP program on August 26. This means that, depending on the timing of the Snapshot vote, there could be up to 2-3 weeks of retroactive gas rebates.</p>
<p>The proposed extension would conclude on November 30, 2024.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Overall Cost</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The cost to the Arbitrum DAO can be seen as an opportunity cost of 174,958 ARB, or potentially even less. Originally, the DAO approved a grant of 1,000,000 ARB—funds that were effectively budgeted and allocated—of which only 75,042 ARB was utilized during the 12-week LTIPP period.</p>
<p>We are now requesting to retain 174,958 ARB from the initial allocation to continue offsetting costs for DeFi applications that use Pyth’s on-demand price feeds. The remaining 750,000 ARB will be returned to the Arbitrum DAO as previously agreed under the LTIPP program. Furthermore, if any funds remain unspent before the outlined timeline concludes, Pyth Data Association will promptly return those ARB tokens to the DAO.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Additional Context</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>We have been actively seeking feedback and advice from <a class=""mention"" href=""/u/matt_stablelab"">@Matt_StableLab</a> to determine the best approach for moving forward with this extension request.</p>
<p>Our interest in extending the LTIPP grant was initiated in the original LTIPP discussion <a href=""https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/pyth-network-ltipp-application-draft/22003/10"">here</a>.</p>
<p>Currently, we plan to submit this extension request on Snapshot by Thursday, September 5, with support from Wintermute. This timeline allows ample opportunity to gather feedback on the proposal and make any necessary adjustments based on input from the DAO.</p>
<p>Please note that Wintermute will merely be sponsoring the proposal as a delegate which is separate from their role as an LTIPP Council member.</p>"

<p>As for any oracle (or infrastructure provider), success is measured by the success of those who depend upon it. The initial LTIPP program granted to the Pyth oracle has already shown a great success in increasing key metrics for Arbitrum DeFi apps such an increase in TVL, trading volume (for perpetual protocols) and a significantly greater availability of freely available price updates onchain (reminder that reading Pyth prices onchain is free, only writing incurs costs).</p>
<p>By extending the program, Pyth Network aims to build on this momentum, ensuring that Arbitrum remains a leading layer for DeFi innovation.</p>
<p>For the latter question, the first thing that comes to mind is the support of the tentative/upcoming stARB token with a Pyth price feed. This would enable all Arbitrum dApps (money-market to perpetual protocols) to integrate and support this asset that is likely to get a significant traction given its properties.</p>
<p>A positive side-effect outside of Arbitrum is that a Pyth stARB price feed would also be automatically available on all the other chains (70+) Pyth supports - and here Arbitrum Orbit chains could also greatly benefit from that as the Pyth oracle expands there.</p>
<p>And as a matter of fact, the Pyth oracle has been <a href=""https://xchain-explorer.idex.io/address/0x2880aB155794e7179c9eE2e38200202908C17B43"" rel=""noopener nofollow ugc"">deployed on XCHAIN</a>, a brand new Orbit chain for IDEX, an omnichain perpetual protocol.</p>"

<p>It’s worth noting that while Pyth received 1M in ARB for incentives, only 75,000 had been used by the end of the LTIPP. This could indicate an unintentional oversight in fund allocation. Moving forward, it would be helpful to reassess how we distribute funding to ensure we’re aligning with actual needs and optimizing ARB resources.</p>

<p>educated and wild guess on my side, the application was crafted and evaluated with pre dencun metrics. This has been one of the (several) challenges for both protocols and advisors during LTIPP program. Since in the <a href=""https://www.arbgrants.com/d/Arbitrum%20LTIPP/Grants-M-R/Pyth-Network"" rel=""noopener nofollow ugc"">PYTH reporting</a> there is no mention of specific delay in integration, I might just be right here but happy to have more details. Also, the byproduct of this result for future program could be that for infra projects a pre-allocated budget might not be the way to got.</p>
<p>Going back to the snapshot, as for the synthetix application, I am, unfortunately, voting against it, as well as the other extention requests in Arbitrum. To quote my previous answer:</p>

<p>I would have normally been in favour if it wasn’t for the detox proposal just recently presented, and passed, in our DAO; but that proposal is an extremely important signal about 1) trying to see what happens to our chains with no incentives 2) give the time to the DAO to best reflect how to weaponize these programs in future. There is also the secondary point, not necessarily as important but indeed important, about competitive advantages of protocols asking for an extention versus protocols that just finished in LTIPP or about to finish in STIP.</p>

</aside>
<p>In here we have a different situation, which is a potential usage of funds for an infra product, so I could see the merit of the extention. But the mix of the detox proposal + the fact that most of the leftover funds are tied, in my understanding, to lower costs than expected, means that the only real reason to keep Pyth in an extention would be to facilitate his role in Arbitrum. This is something we could advocate for Synthetix and Aave as well, even if their role is different. Again, the vote of the DAO for the detox proposal is more important, and should just be respected by participants.</p>"

<li><strong>Abstract</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This proposal seeks a 12 weeks extension (until November 30) of the Pyth Network’s <a href=""https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/pyth-network-ltipp-application-draft/22003"">previously approved LTIPP grant</a>.</p>
<p>Initially, the Pyth Network was allocated 1,000,000 ARB through the LTIPP process. To date, we have utilized approximately 75,042 ARB over the 12-week duration of the program.</p>
<p>We are requesting to retain 174,958 ARB, bringing our total expenditure to 250,000 ARB out of the original 1,000,000, until the new grant programs are established.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Motivation</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>We want to highlight that incentives for infrastructure protocols and public goods, such as the Pyth oracle, typically do not yield immediate results. The impact from making such incentives available to DeFi often unfolds over weeks or even months.</p>
<p>For existing DeFi applications, switching to a new oracle involves significant effort and may require a new audit. Similarly, expanding from other chains to Arbitrum can be more time-consuming than anticipated, as illustrated by the Synthetix case <a href=""https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/synthetix-ltipp-application-final/22023/20"">here</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks to the initial LTIPP program, Arbitrum dApps had the ability to build robust oracle systems covering over 500 assets, including cryptocurrencies, FX, stocks, ETFs, and commodities. This advancement has eliminated outdated on-chain price updates and high costs, reinforcing Arbitrum’s position as a premier layer for DeFi. This progress empowers developers to create cutting-edge applications without constraints. This extension aims to keep the momentum and further empower potential new entrants like Synthetix to deliver a best-in-class protocol.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rationale</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The proposed extension of the Pyth Network’s LTIPP grant is designed to further cultivate a thriving and innovative DeFi ecosystem on Arbitrum. The LTIPP program has already proven its effectiveness, with Pyth price updates on-chain increasing by 2-3 times and peaking at nearly 10 times the previous levels, reaching over 70,000 updates on July 14.</p>
<p>Before the program began, the total value secured by the Pyth oracle on Arbitrum was just over 43,000 ETH. This figure has since risen to 52,500 ETH, reflecting an increase of more than 20%.</p>
<p>Pyth has also enabled over $16.1 billion in trading volume on various Arbitrum decentralized perpetual exchanges during June and July (with August data pending). This  underscores the benefits for applications powered by Pyth Network: protocols using Pyth have experienced, including increased total value locked (TVL), higher trading volumes, and more frequent price updates driven by a growing number of applications utilizing Pyth.</p>
<p>The request for a 12-week extension, with a reduced ARB allocation, is part of our commitment towards responsible resource management commitment to responsible resource management while continuing to support the long-term success of applications built on Arbitrum that leverage Pyth. By covering the gas costs for using the Pyth oracle, the network has enabled more developers to create robust DeFi applications without the burden of high operational expenses.</p>
<p>This strategy strengthens Arbitrum’s position as a premier platform for DeFi innovation, where developers can access over 500 price feeds without financial or technical constraints.</p>
<p>It’s important to understand that the impact of incentives for infastructure protocols and public goods like the Pyth price oracle are not immediate: it often takes weeks or even months to materialize.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it’s important to recognize that the impact of incentives for infrastructure protocols and public goods like the Pyth oracle is not immediate; it often takes weeks or even months to materialize.</p>
<p>This proposal, aims to build on the momentum generated by the initial LTIPP program, ensuring the continued growth and expansion of the Arbitrum ecosystem as new grant strategies are developed and implemented.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Key Terms</strong></li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>On-demand or pull oracle: An oracle network where anyone can permissionlessly trigger price updates on-chain by doing an Arbitrum tx</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>Specifications</strong></li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>13 weeks duration</li>
<li>175,000 ARB</li>
</ol>
<p>The proposed extension duration is similar to that of the previous LTIPP program—12 weeks versus 13 weeks (including retroactive rebates for the end of August). However, the amount of ARB tokens requested for gas rebates has increased from 75,000 ARB to 175,000 ARB.</p>
<p>This increase reflects an anticipated rise in activity and associated costs, estimated at approximately 133%. The launch of Synthetix’s Multi-Collateral Perps on Arbitrum is expected to drive a substantial increase in the number of price updates triggered on-chain. For context, Synthetix currently triggers around 1,000 daily updates on Optimism and between 3,000 and 5,000 daily updates on Base—both without additional incentives in place.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Steps to Implement</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>If the Arbitrum DAO approves this extension, no additional work or involvement will be required from the DAO itself. The responsibility for managing the funds and continuing the program would remain entirely with the Pyth Data Association.</p>
<p>As during the initial 12 weeks of the LTIPP, the Pyth Data Association would continue reimbursing dApps for gas costs every two weeks. Additionally, we would maintain our practice of providing bi-weekly updates on the Arbitrum forum to ensure transparency and accountability. Our latest report is available <a href=""https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/pyth-network-bi-weekly-update-26-august-2024/26525"">here</a>, and we are open to including even more detailed data and information in these reports if needed.</p>
<p>Since this is an extension of an already approved grant, no additional legal work is necessary. The Pyth Data Association has already completed KYC and signed the grant agreement with the Arbitrum Foundation.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Timeline</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The LTIPP program officially ended on August 26, and until this extension proposal is approved, the Pyth Data Association has paused reimbursing the gas costs incurred by dApps during this period.</p>
<p>If approved, the extension would be applied retroactively, starting from the end of the LTIPP program on August 26. This means that, depending on the timing of the Snapshot vote, there could be up to 2-3 weeks of retroactive gas rebates.</p>
<p>The proposed extension would conclude on November 30, 2024.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Overall Cost</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The cost to the Arbitrum DAO can be seen as an opportunity cost of 174,958 ARB, or potentially even less. Originally, the DAO approved a grant of 1,000,000 ARB—funds that were effectively budgeted and allocated—of which only 75,042 ARB was utilized during the 12-week LTIPP period.</p>
<p>We are now requesting to retain 174,958 ARB from the initial allocation to continue offsetting costs for DeFi applications that use Pyth’s on-demand price feeds. The remaining 750,000 ARB will be returned to the Arbitrum DAO as previously agreed under the LTIPP program. Furthermore, if any funds remain unspent before the outlined timeline concludes, Pyth Data Association will promptly return those ARB tokens to the DAO.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Additional Context</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>We have been actively seeking feedback and advice from <a class=""mention"" href=""/u/matt_stablelab"">@Matt_StableLab</a> to determine the best approach for moving forward with this extension request.</p>
<p>Our interest in extending the LTIPP grant was initiated in the original LTIPP discussion <a href=""https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/pyth-network-ltipp-application-draft/22003/10"">here</a>.</p>
<p>Currently, we plan to submit this extension request on Snapshot by Thursday, September 5, with support from Wintermute. This timeline allows ample opportunity to gather feedback on the proposal and make any necessary adjustments based on input from the DAO.</p>
<p>Please note that Wintermute will merely be sponsoring the proposal as a delegate which is separate from their role as an LTIPP Council member.</p>"

<p>As for any oracle (or infrastructure provider), success is measured by the success of those who depend upon it. The initial LTIPP program granted to the Pyth oracle has already shown a great success in increasing key metrics for Arbitrum DeFi apps such an increase in TVL, trading volume (for perpetual protocols) and a significantly greater availability of freely available price updates onchain (reminder that reading Pyth prices onchain is free, only writing incurs costs).</p>
<p>By extending the program, Pyth Network aims to build on this momentum, ensuring that Arbitrum remains a leading layer for DeFi innovation.</p>
<p>For the latter question, the first thing that comes to mind is the support of the tentative/upcoming stARB token with a Pyth price feed. This would enable all Arbitrum dApps (money-market to perpetual protocols) to integrate and support this asset that is likely to get a significant traction given its properties.</p>
<p>A positive side-effect outside of Arbitrum is that a Pyth stARB price feed would also be automatically available on all the other chains (70+) Pyth supports - and here Arbitrum Orbit chains could also greatly benefit from that as the Pyth oracle expands there.</p>
<p>And as a matter of fact, the Pyth oracle has been <a href=""https://xchain-explorer.idex.io/address/0x2880aB155794e7179c9eE2e38200202908C17B43"" rel=""noopener nofollow ugc"">deployed on XCHAIN</a>, a brand new Orbit chain for IDEX, an omnichain perpetual protocol.</p>"

Should the LTIPP council have been given the proper clearance to push an extension or does this belong to some oversight body separate from the general DAO body.</p>
<p>It’s worth noting that while Pyth received 1M in ARB for incentives, only 75,000 had been used by the end of the LTIPP. This could indicate an unintentional oversight in fund allocation. Moving forward, it would be helpful to reassess how we distribute funding to ensure we’re aligning with actual needs and optimizing ARB resources.</p>"

It is entirely reasonable for Pyth to apply for an extension of the LTIPP, especially since the budget is not excessively large, which is commendable. I always believe that for a business organization to succeed, it must strive to control costs—achieving more with less has always been my guiding principle. Therefore, I fully support this proposal.</p>"

<p>educated and wild guess on my side, the application was crafted and evaluated with pre dencun metrics. This has been one of the (several) challenges for both protocols and advisors during LTIPP program. Since in the <a href=""https://www.arbgrants.com/d/Arbitrum%20LTIPP/Grants-M-R/Pyth-Network"" rel=""noopener nofollow ugc"">PYTH reporting</a> there is no mention of specific delay in integration, I might just be right here but happy to have more details. Also, the byproduct of this result for future program could be that for infra projects a pre-allocated budget might not be the way to got.</p>
<p>Going back to the snapshot, as for the synthetix application, I am, unfortunately, voting against it, as well as the other extention requests in Arbitrum. To quote my previous answer:</p>

<p>I would have normally been in favour if it wasn’t for the detox proposal just recently presented, and passed, in our DAO; but that proposal is an extremely important signal about 1) trying to see what happens to our chains with no incentives 2) give the time to the DAO to best reflect how to weaponize these programs in future. There is also the secondary point, not necessarily as important but indeed important, about competitive advantages of protocols asking for an extention versus protocols that just finished in LTIPP or about to finish in STIP.</p>

</aside>
<p>In here we have a different situation, which is a potential usage of funds for an infra product, so I could see the merit of the extention. But the mix of the detox proposal + the fact that most of the leftover funds are tied, in my understanding, to lower costs than expected, means that the only real reason to keep Pyth in an extention would be to facilitate his role in Arbitrum. This is something we could advocate for Synthetix and Aave as well, even if their role is different. Again, the vote of the DAO for the detox proposal is more important, and should just be respected by participants.</p>"
